### [1] [Unmasking the Reality of PII Masking Models: Performance Gaps and the Call for Accountability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12308)
*Devansh Singh,Sundaraparipurnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了隐私掩码技术的局限性，分析了现有PII数据集和NER方法的不足，并通过实验展示了模型使用中的隐私暴露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示现有隐私掩码技术和数据集在识别和保护PII时的局限性，以及这些局限性可能导致的隐私风险。

Method: 方法包括构建一个包含17K半合成句子的数据集，涵盖16种PII类型，并在五个NER检测维度和一个对抗性上下文中测试模型性能。

Result: 结果表明，现有模型在PII识别和掩码方面存在显著不足，可能导致隐私暴露。

Conclusion: 结论强调了模型性能评估的不足，并呼吁在模型卡片中提供更多上下文信息以提高透明度。

Abstract: Privacy Masking is a critical concept under data privacy involving
anonymization and de-anonymization of personally identifiable information
(PII). Privacy masking techniques rely on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
approaches under NLP support in identifying and classifying named entities in
each text. NER approaches, however, have several limitations including (a)
content sensitivity including ambiguous, polysemic, context dependent or domain
specific content, (b) phrasing variabilities including nicknames and alias,
informal expressions, alternative representations, emerging expressions,
evolving naming conventions and (c) formats or syntax variations, typos,
misspellings. However, there are a couple of PII datasets that have been widely
used by researchers and the open-source community to train models on PII
detection or masking. These datasets have been used to train models including
Piiranha and Starpii, which have been downloaded over 300k and 580k times on
HuggingFace. We examine the quality of the PII masking by these models given
the limitations of the datasets and of the NER approaches. We curate a dataset
of 17K unique, semi-synthetic sentences containing 16 types of PII by compiling
information from across multiple jurisdictions including India, U.K and U.S. We
generate sentences (using language models) containing these PII at five
different NER detection feature dimensions - (1) Basic Entity Recognition, (2)
Contextual Entity Disambiguation, (3) NER in Noisy & Real-World Data, (4)
Evolving & Novel Entities Detection and (5) Cross-Lingual or multi-lingual NER)
and 1 in adversarial context. We present the results and exhibit the privacy
exposure caused by such model use (considering the extent of lifetime downloads
of these models). We conclude by highlighting the gaps in measuring performance
of the models and the need for contextual disclosure in model cards for such
models.

### [2] [Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311)
*Enming Zhang,Liwen Cao,Yanru Wu,Zijie Zhao,Guan Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HGPrompt是一个自适应框架，通过优化可迁移性和稳定性，实现多源提示的有效集成，提升新任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练提示作为重要资产，多源提示结合可增强泛化能力，但简单聚合易导致表示崩溃。

Method: 引入信息论指标评估提示特征的可迁移性，并提出梯度对齐正则化以减少干扰。

Result: 在大规模VTAB基准测试中，HGPrompt达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HGPrompt有效解决了多源提示迁移中的干扰问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight adaptation strategy for adapting
foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly in resource-constrained
systems. As pre-trained prompts have become valuable intellectual assets,
combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance
generalization to new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge from diverse
sources. However, naive aggregation of these prompts often leads to
representation collapse due to mutual interference, undermining their
collective potential. To address these challenges, we propose HGPrompt, an
adaptive framework for multi-source prompt transfer that learns optimal
ensemble weights by jointly optimizing dual objectives: transferability and
stability. Specifically, we first introduce an information-theoretic metric to
evaluate the transferability of prompt-induced features on the target task,
capturing the intrinsic alignment between the feature representations.
Additionally, we propose a novel Gradient Alignment Regularization to mitigate
gradient conflicts among prompts, enabling stable and coherent knowledge
transfer from multiple sources while suppressing interference. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate that HGPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in
multi-source prompt transfer.

### [3] [Socrates or Smartypants: Testing Logic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models with Logic Programming-based Test Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12312)
*Zihao Xu,Junchen Ding,Yiling Lou,Kun Zhang,Dong Gong,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SmartyPat-Bench，一个基于真实Reddit帖子构建的逻辑谬误评测基准，以及SmartyPat框架，用于自动生成高质量逻辑谬误数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测数据集过于简单或不自然，无法充分评估大语言模型的逻辑推理能力。

Method: 提出SmartyPat-Bench基准和SmartyPat框架，后者利用逻辑编程和LLM生成自然语言谬误。

Result: SmartyPat生成的谬误与人工生成的质量相当，且显著优于基线方法。实验还揭示了LLM在谬误检测中的表现。

Conclusion: SmartyPat为逻辑谬误评测提供了高质量数据，并揭示了LLM在推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language
understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning
abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and
benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually
constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce
SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled
benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle
logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more
detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To
further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data
collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive
annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic
programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically
generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent
natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable
in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly
outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into
LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder
fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy
categorization performance.

### [4] [Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on Conversational Recommender Systems: A Simulation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12313)
*Xiaoyan Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenjie Wang,Hongzhan lin,Hong Cheng,Rui Zhang,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的个性化感知用户模拟系统（PerCRS），用于研究人格特质如何影响对话推荐系统的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格特质对用户交互行为有显著影响，但目前对话推荐系统（CRSs）中缺乏对其的系统研究。

Method: 引入PerCRS，用户代理模拟个性化特质和偏好，系统代理具备说服能力以模拟真实交互。采用多角度评估确保鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，先进的LLM能生成符合指定人格特质的多样化用户响应，促使CRSs动态调整推荐策略。

Conclusion: 研究为理解人格特质对对话推荐系统结果的影响提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn
interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural
and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in
understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation
outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits
on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based
personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces
customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent
possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs.
We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct
extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user
responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to
dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis
offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes
of conversational recommender systems.

### [5] [How to Detect and Defeat Molecular Mirage: A Metric-Driven Benchmark for Hallucination in LLM-based Molecular Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12314)
*Hao Li,Liuzhenghao Lv,He Cao,Zijing Liu,Zhiyuan Yan,Yu Wang,Yonghong Tian,Yu Li,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mol-Hallu的新评估指标，用于量化大语言模型在分子理解任务中的幻觉问题，并提出了幻觉减少后处理阶段（HRPP）以缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在分子理解任务中存在幻觉问题，导致药物设计和利用中的错误，亟需解决以提高可靠性。

Method: 分析了PubChem数据集中的知识捷径现象，提出Mol-Hallu指标评估幻觉，并设计HRPP后处理阶段减少幻觉。

Result: 实验证明HRPP在解码器和编码器-解码器分子大语言模型中均有效。

Conclusion: 研究为减少幻觉并提升大语言模型在科学应用中的可靠性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially
for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected
by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In
this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular
comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in
the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks
with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel
free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based
on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual
molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze
the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension
tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is
proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the
effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our
findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving
the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Capybara-OMNI是一种轻量高效的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），支持文本、图像、视频和音频模态的理解，并通过详细框架设计和训练方法实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于构建和训练多模态数据对的复杂性，开发强大的MLLM仍是一个计算和时间密集型任务。

Method: 介绍了Capybara-OMNI的框架设计、数据构建和训练方法，并提供了专属基准测试以验证多模态理解能力。

Conclusion: 公开了Capybara-OMNI模型及其聊天版本，包括模型权重、部分训练数据和推理代码，以促进社区发展。

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous
outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due
to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a
computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work,
we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient
manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We
present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training
recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We
also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to
properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results
show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that
achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various
multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction
following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how
to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in
line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We
publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version.
The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data,
and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

*Jingyuan Zhang,Hongzhi Zhang,Zhou Haonan,Chenxi Sun,Xingguang ji,Jiakang Wang,Fanheng Kong,Yahui Liu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“数据代谢”的数据中心框架，用于构建视觉语言模型（VLM），并通过闭环系统持续优化模型性能。发布的Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，甚至超越了一些更大的开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据管理对训练强大的视觉语言模型至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统性。本文旨在通过数据代谢框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出数据代谢框架，包括数据管理和迭代两个关键步骤，形成闭环系统。详细介绍了如何处理大规模数据集并构建用户特定数据飞轮。

Result: Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，超越了一些更大的开源模型，并与领先的专有模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 数据中心框架展示了训练更小、更高效视觉语言模型的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Data curation plays a crucial role in training powerful Visual Language
Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Metabolism and
present our data-centric framework to build VLMs throughout the development
lifecycle. Starting from a standard model architecture, we discuss and provide
insights into two crucial development steps: data curation and iteration,
forming a closed-loop system that continuously improves model performance. We
show a detailed codebook on how to process existing massive datasets and build
user-specific data flywheel. As a demonstration, we release a VLM, named
Capybara-VL, which excels in typical multimodal tasks (e.g. , visual question
answering, scientific reasoning, and text-rich tasks). Despite its relatively
compact size, Capybara-VL surpasses several open-source models that are up to
10 times larger in size. Moreover, it achieves results that are on par with
those of several leading proprietary models, demonstrating its remarkable
competitiveness. These results highlight the power of our data-centric
framework and the potential of training smaller and more efficient VLMs.

### [8] [ChatGPT as Linguistic Equalizer? Quantifying LLM-Driven Lexical Shifts in Academic Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12317)
*Dingkang Lin,Naixuan Zhao,Dan Tian,Jiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT显著提升了非英语母语学者（NNES）在学术写作中的词汇复杂度，减少了语言障碍，促进了学术公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT是否能够帮助非英语母语学者克服学术写作中的语言障碍，从而提升全球学术公平性。

Method: 使用MTLD量化词汇复杂度，并采用DID设计分析2.8百万篇OpenAlex文章（2020-2024）的因果效应。

Result: ChatGPT显著提升了NNES作者摘要的词汇复杂度，尤其在预印本、技术和生物领域及低级别期刊中效果最明显。

Conclusion: ChatGPT有效减少了语言差异，促进了全球学术公平。

Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has profoundly reshaped scientific research practices,
particularly in academic writing, where non-native English-speakers (NNES)
historically face linguistic barriers. This study investigates whether ChatGPT
mitigates these barriers and fosters equity by analyzing lexical complexity
shifts across 2.8 million articles from OpenAlex (2020-2024). Using the Measure
of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) to quantify vocabulary sophistication and a
difference-in-differences (DID) design to identify causal effects, we
demonstrate that ChatGPT significantly enhances lexical complexity in
NNES-authored abstracts, even after controlling for article-level controls,
authorship patterns, and venue norms. Notably, the impact is most pronounced in
preprint papers, technology- and biology-related fields and lower-tier
journals. These findings provide causal evidence that ChatGPT reduces
linguistic disparities and promotes equity in global academia.

### [9] [Has the Creativity of Large-Language Models peaked? An analysis of inter- and intra-LLM variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12320)
*Jennifer Haase,Paul H. P. Hanel,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在创意任务中表现接近或超过人类，但其创意能力并未随时间显著提升，且输出存在较大变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在创意任务中的表现是否随时间提升，以及其创意输出的稳定性。

Method: 评估14种LLM（如GPT-4、Claude等）在Divergent Association Task（DAT）和Alternative Uses Task（AUT）中的表现。

Result: LLM创意表现未随时间显著提升，GPT-4表现下降；AUT中LLM平均优于人类，但仅0.28%达到人类顶尖水平；同一模型输出变异性大。

Conclusion: 需更细致的评估框架，重视模型选择、提示设计和重复评估，以避免高估或低估LLM的创意潜力。

Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies
reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human
performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have
become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In
this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,
Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the
Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary
to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over
the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.
For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the
average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of
LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.
Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model
variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging
from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for
both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability
risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or
underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs
differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation
frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and
repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative
contexts.

### [10] [AttentionDefense: Leveraging System Prompt Attention for Explainable Defense Against Novel Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12321)
*Charlotte Siska,Anush Sankaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AttentionDefense的新方法，利用小型语言模型（SLMs）的系统提示注意力来检测和解释对抗性提示，提供了一种更便宜且可解释的防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LMs）在多领域表现出色，但其易受恶意输入攻击（jailbreak），导致行为偏离预期。现有防御方法难以解释恶意输入的成因，因此需要一种更透明且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过SLMs的系统提示注意力机制，分析对抗性提示的特征，提出AttentionDefense方法，并在现有和新型jailbreak数据集上进行评估。

Result: AttentionDefense在检测性能上优于基于文本嵌入的分类器和GPT-4零样本检测器，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: AttentionDefense是一种高效、可解释且低成本的防御方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human
capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and
exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious
input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended
behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as
adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is
challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,
which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we
propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models
(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,
explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research
suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding
and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the
semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated
against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that
SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection
performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot
detectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark
dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that
the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel
jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.
Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as
it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM
detector.

### [11] [A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LLMs Matches Large LLMs in Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12322)
*Xin Gao,Qizhi Pei,Zinan Tang,Yu Li,Honglin Lin,Jiang Wu,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GRA的框架，通过多个小型语言模型（LLM）协作模拟同行评审过程，以生成高质量数据，避免依赖单一大型LLM的高成本和潜在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据合成方法依赖大型LLM，存在高计算成本、环境不友好和潜在偏见问题，而小型LLM虽可持续但能力有限。

Method: GRA框架将小型LLM分为Generator、Reviewer和Adjudicator三个角色，分别负责生成、评审和裁决数据，模拟同行评审流程。

Result: 实验表明，GRA生成的数据质量与大型LLM（如Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct）相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究证明小型LLM通过协作可替代大型LLM进行高质量数据合成，提倡战略协调小型模型而非依赖单一大型模型。

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance
small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models
(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,
and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,
smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual
capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable
data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose
a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized
roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically
achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small
LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a
peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial
data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the
Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the
synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can
achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through
experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data
matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large
models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic
coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly
available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG通过引入外部知识减少LLMs的幻觉问题，但其公平性影响尚未明确。实验发现小规模LLMs（<8B）的公平性可能因RAG而恶化，并提出FairFT和FairFilter两种方法改善公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAG框架对LLMs公平性的影响，尤其是在小规模模型中的应用问题。

Method: 通过实验分析不同规模LLMs、检索器和检索源的影响，提出FairFT（公平对齐检索器）和FairFilter（公平过滤机制）两种方法。

Result: 小规模LLMs（<8B）的公平性可能因RAG而恶化；FairFT和FairFilter能有效改善公平性且保持性能。

Conclusion: RAG对小规模LLMs的公平性有负面影响，但提出的方法能有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing
this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually
incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,
there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of
RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded
significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable
societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact
does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To
address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,
retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the
scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes
within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the
integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale
LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness
issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,
FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the
LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate
fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism
to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed
approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
improving fairness while maintaining performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的跨文档跨语言自然语言推理（CDCL-NLI）范式，构建了包含1,110个实例的高质量数据集，并提出了一种结合RST增强图融合和可解释性预测的创新方法。实验表明该方法优于传统NLI模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档跨语言自然语言推理（CDCL-NLI）是一个尚未充分探索的领域，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种结合RST增强图融合和可解释性预测的方法，利用RGAT进行跨文档上下文建模，并通过基于词汇链的结构感知语义对齐机制实现跨语言理解。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著优于传统NLI模型（如DocNLI和R2F）和大型语言模型（如Llama3和GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 本文为NLI研究提供了新视角，并推动了跨文档跨语言上下文理解、语义检索和可解释性推理的研究兴趣。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural
language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many
sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual
NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional
NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this
task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances
and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose
an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and
interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure

TL;DR: LLMTaxo框架利用大语言模型自动构建社交媒体事实主张的分类法，通过多粒度生成主题，帮助用户更高效地导航社交媒体内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体内容的爆炸式增长，分析和理解在线讨论变得日益复杂，需要一种自动化工具来分类事实主张。

Method: 提出LLMTaxo框架，利用不同的大语言模型在三个数据集上实现多粒度主题生成，并设计专门的分类法评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，LLMTaxo能有效分类社交媒体事实主张，某些模型在特定数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMTaxo为社交媒体事实主张的分类提供了有效工具，未来可进一步优化模型选择。

Abstract: With the vast expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and
comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper
introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the
automated construction of taxonomy of factual claims from social media by
generating topics from multi-level granularities. This approach aids
stakeholders in more effectively navigating the social media landscapes. We
implement this framework with different models across three distinct datasets
and introduce specially designed taxonomy evaluation metrics for a
comprehensive assessment. With the evaluations from both human evaluators and
GPT-4, the results indicate that LLMTaxo effectively categorizes factual claims
from social media, and reveals that certain models perform better on specific
datasets.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型从临床病例报告中提取时间定位发现的管道，并生成了一个关于Sepsis-3的开放文本时间序列数据集。验证结果显示高恢复率和强时间顺序性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床病例报告和出院总结虽然完整准确，但通常在患者接触后完成，而结构化数据流虽更早可用但不完整。研究旨在利用更完整和细粒度的时间数据进行模型训练。

Method: 构建了一个管道，利用大语言模型对病例报告中的时间定位发现进行表型提取和注释，并应用于生成Sepsis-3的开放文本时间序列数据集。

Result: 验证结果显示高恢复率（事件匹配率：O1-preview--0.755，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753）和强时间顺序性（一致性：O1-preview--0.932，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932）。

Conclusion: 研究展示了大语言模型在时间定位临床发现中的能力，但也指出了其在时间重建中的局限性，并提出了多模态整合的改进方向。

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and
accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e.,
timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become
available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms
on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to
phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports
using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access
textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the
Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA
and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to
physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings
(event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and
strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize
clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal
reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via
multimodal integration.

TL;DR: 该研究首次大规模分析了中国官方媒体（1950-2019年）中社会群体的语言表征，发现其与西方模式显著不同，尤其在性别和经济阶层方面变化剧烈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨革命性社会变革如何通过官方语言表征反映社会群体，填补非西方语境下语言与社会结构关系的研究空白。

Method: 使用历时词嵌入技术，分析中国官方媒体在不同时间分辨率下的语言模式。

Result: 中国社会群体的语言表征在性别和经济阶层上变化显著，而种族、年龄和体型等刻板印象则相对稳定。

Conclusion: 官方话语通过语言编码社会结构，强调非西方视角在计算社会科学中的重要性。

Abstract: Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns.
While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis
of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western
contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese
state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social
transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social
groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we
find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western
counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender.
These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of
ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political
upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic
shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our
understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure
through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives
in computational social science.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Speculative Thinking”的训练免费框架，通过让大型推理模型在推理阶段指导小型模型，显著提升了推理准确性和输出效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法成本高且输出冗长，需改进推理模型的效率和准确性。

Method: 利用大型模型指导小型模型进行推理，基于对支持性令牌和反射行为的观察。

Result: 1.5B模型的准确率提升6.2%，输出长度减少15.7%；非推理模型准确率提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架无需训练即可显著提升模型性能，适用于推理和非推理任务。

Abstract: Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning
performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still
suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. We introduce Speculative
Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to
guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from
speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based
on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently
appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for
reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over
reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving
reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more
capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of
reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B
reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to
89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average
output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7%
decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model
(Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), our framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8%
on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%.

Motivation: 传统单智能体RAG在解决需要跨异构数据协调推理的复杂查询时存在局限性，HM-RAG旨在通过多智能体协作实现动态知识合成。

Method: HM-RAG采用三层架构：分解代理将复杂查询拆分为子任务，多源检索代理并行检索不同模态数据，决策代理通过一致性投票整合结果并解决差异。

Result: 在ScienceQA和CrisisMMD基准测试中，HM-RAG的答案准确性提升了12.95%，问题分类准确性提升了3.56%，并在零样本设置中达到最优结果。

Conclusion: HM-RAG通过模块化架构实现了多模态推理和知识合成的重大进展，同时支持新数据模态的无缝集成和严格数据治理。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains
fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated
reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel
Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative
intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured,
and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture
with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries
into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and
schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry
out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed
for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses
consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies
in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains
comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and
web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer
accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline
RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG
establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets.
Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities
while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in
addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge
synthesis in RAG systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的细粒度情感-原因-类别三元组提取方法，通过指令调优和数据增强技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在冗余信息检索和情感类别确定上的困难，特别是隐式或模糊情感表达的情况。

Method: 采用任务特定的三元组提取指令和低秩适应技术微调大语言模型，并结合提示数据增强策略生成高质量合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在提取指标上至少提升了12.8%，表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感原因分析研究提供了新方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and
complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying
emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the
text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly
concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level
emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating
from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining
emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or
ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained
approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces
an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation
techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs
task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation
to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate
task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation
strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models
in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level
emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for
advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at

Motivation: 探讨LLM能力是否接近人类能力，并量化其表现。

Method: 收集80多个LLM在37个基准测试中的表现数据，按人类能力的6大类和11小类分类，并进行聚类分析。

Result: 1. 小规模LLM部分能力可用人类指标描述；2. 人类相关能力在LLM中不相关；3. LLM能力随参数规模显著变化。

Conclusion: LLM能力与人类能力部分重叠但存在差异，且受模型规模影响。

Abstract: Users of Large Language Models (LLMs) often perceive these models as
intelligent entities with human-like capabilities. However, the extent to which
LLMs' capabilities truly approximate human abilities remains a topic of debate.
In this paper, to characterize the capabilities of LLMs in relation to human
capabilities, we collected performance data from over 80 models across 37
evaluation benchmarks. The evaluation benchmarks are categorized into 6 primary
abilities and 11 sub-abilities in human aspect. Then, we then clustered the
performance rankings into several categories and compared these clustering
results with classifications based on human ability aspects. Our findings lead
to the following conclusions: 1. We have confirmed that certain capabilities of
LLMs with fewer than 10 billion parameters can indeed be described using human
ability metrics; 2. While some abilities are considered interrelated in humans,
they appear nearly uncorrelated in LLMs; 3. The capabilities possessed by LLMs
vary significantly with the parameter scale of the model.

Motivation: 由于开放性问题评估的主观性，研究小型LLMs在评估游戏玩家回答时的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用五种小型LLMs评估游戏《En-join》中的玩家回答，并采用二元分类指标（如准确率、真阳性率、真阴性率）进行系统比较。

Result: 不同模型在识别正确答案、假阳性或不一致评估方面表现各异，揭示了敏感性和特异性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在部署LLMs作为评估工具时，需选择适合的模型并采用上下文感知的评估框架，为AI驱动的评估工具的可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique
challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy
and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for
local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale
LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates
decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary
classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true
negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different
evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of
each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct
responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations.
The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and
careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work
contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven
assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle
subjective evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂医学任务中因术语和临床数据敏感性导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出QM-ToT框架，结合树状思维推理和评估层，分解医学问题并优化量化模型。

Result: LLaMA2-70b准确率从34%提升至50%，LLaMA-3.1-8b从58.77%提升至69.49%；数据蒸馏方法效率提升86.27%。

Conclusion: QM-ToT首次证明树状思维可显著提升医学任务性能，为资源受限环境下的量化模型部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized
biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the
sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate
medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to
performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To
address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a
path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT)
reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable
subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates
substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the
challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable
accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to
69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation
method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we
achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work,
for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance
performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for
future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited
medical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM通常通过API提供服务，开发者难以检测其行为变化，因此需要一种轻量级的方法来监控模型变化。

Method: 通过统计测试比较两个文本样本的语言和心理语言学特征分布，判断LLM是否发生变化。

Result: 实验表明，简单的文本特征结合统计测试可以区分不同语言模型，并能检测提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对LLM变化的低成本监控，避免了计算密集型基准评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API,
making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We
present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions
of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses
a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two
samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has
changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI
completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that
simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between
language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt
injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids
computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI聊天机器人（如ChatGPT）在非正式心理健康支持中的角色及其潜力与风险。

Method: 通过分析10,000多条TikTok评论，使用分层编码方案和监督分类模型识别用户经验和主题。

Result: 约20%的评论反映个人使用，用户态度积极，主要受益包括易用性和情感支持，但隐私和缺乏专业监督是主要问题。

Conclusion: AI在心理健康支持中的应用日益重要，但需加强临床和伦理审查。

Abstract: The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing
public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support
tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large
language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency,
empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with
LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from
videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered
coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user
experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of
comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly
positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional
support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy,
generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It
is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic
framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings
underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also
highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI
for mental health support.

Motivation: 传统预测模型无法充分利用非结构化临床笔记中的信息，而GPT等大型语言模型（LLMs）可能弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV Note数据集中的14,011例患者数据，将GPT生成的回答作为逻辑回归模型的输入特征。

Result: GPT模型单独使用时优于传统模型，结合两者后AUC平均提升5.1个百分点，高风险组的阳性预测值提升29.9%。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床预测任务中具有显著价值，且在非结构化文本数据未充分利用的领域潜力广阔。

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using
tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to
extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document
diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we
investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical
questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary,
can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011
first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care
Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that
uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our
findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained
on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields
even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage
points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the
highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large
language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the
broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data
remains an underutilized resource.

Motivation: 当前LLM在TTS合成中存在声学特征丢失、依赖对齐数据及优化过程中遗忘文本理解能力的问题，亟需解决。

Method: 提出双分支架构：1）模态对齐分支捕获连续声学嵌入；2）语音生成分支通过模块化微调预测语音标记。

Result: 实验表明GOAT-TTS性能媲美SOTA模型，并验证了方言语音合成的有效性。

Conclusion: GOAT-TTS通过双分支设计解决了现有问题，为TTS合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS)
synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures
exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible
loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2)
stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit
real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text
comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these
challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach
Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework
introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a
speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings,
enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language,
timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript
dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on
top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k
layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token
prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis.
Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of
synthesized dialect speech data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates state-of-the-art,
domain-specific large language models with advanced information retrieval
techniques to deliver comprehensive and context-aware responses. Our approach
facilitates seamless interaction among diverse components, enabling
cross-validation of outputs to produce accurate, high-quality responses
enriched with relevant data, images, tables, and other modalities. We
demonstrate the system's capability to enhance response precision by leveraging
a robust question-answering model, significantly improving the quality of
dialogue generation. The system provides an accessible platform for real-time,
high-fidelity interactions, allowing users to benefit from efficient
human-computer interaction, precise retrieval, and simultaneous access to a
wide range of literature and data. This dramatically improves the research
efficiency of professionals in the biomedical and pharmaceutical domains and
facilitates faster, more informed decision-making throughout the R\&D process.

*Hanmeng Zhong,Linqing Chen,Weilei Wang,Wentao Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了首个针对生物制药领域的检索增强生成评估基准（BRAGE），用于评估LLMs在生物制药领域的查询与参考理解能力（QRUC），并提出了一种基于引用的分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门用于生物制药领域的LLMs评估基准，且传统QA指标在开放检索增强QA场景中表现不足。

Method: 提出BRAGE基准和基于引用的分类方法，用于评估LLMs的QRUC。

Result: 实验显示主流LLMs在生物制药QRUC方面存在显著差距，需改进。

Conclusion: BRAGE填补了生物制药领域LLMs评估的空白，基于引用的方法为开放QA场景提供了更有效的评估手段。

Abstract: Recently, the application of the retrieval-augmented Large Language Models
(LLMs) in specific domains has gained significant attention, especially in
biopharmaceuticals. However, in this context, there is no benchmark
specifically designed for biopharmaceuticals to evaluate LLMs. In this paper,
we introduce the Biopharmaceuticals Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation
(BRAGE) , the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' Query and Reference
Understanding Capability (QRUC) in the biopharmaceutical domain, available in
English, French, German and Chinese. In addition, Traditional
Question-Answering (QA) metrics like accuracy and exact match fall short in the
open-ended retrieval-augmented QA scenarios. To address this, we propose a
citation-based classification method to evaluate the QRUC of LLMs to understand
the relationship between queries and references. We apply this method to
evaluate the mainstream LLMs on BRAGE. Experimental results show that there is
a significant gap in the biopharmaceutical QRUC of mainstream LLMs, and their
QRUC needs to be improved.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLMs）的语义后门攻击及其检测方法RAVEN，揭示了概念级隐藏漏洞的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法忽视语义后门攻击，这些攻击通过概念级触发而非词法异常操纵模型输出。

Method: 通过小规模毒化语料植入语义后门，并开发RAVEN框架，结合语义熵和跨模型一致性分析进行检测。

Result: 实验证明RAVEN能有效检测多种LLM家族中的语义后门，揭示了概念级漏洞。

Conclusion: 语义后门攻击具有实际威胁，需对部署的语言模型进行概念级审计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myriad
language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model
outputs. Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and
therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the
conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely
on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a
controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted
with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We
then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a
black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for
uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with
cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with
structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via
bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model
comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical
evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)
uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first
proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the
urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models. We
open-source our code and data at https://github.com/NayMyatMin/RAVEN.

Motivation: 城市因果研究面临假设生成低效、数据复杂性和方法脆弱性等挑战，LLM为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出AutoUrbanCI框架，包含四个模块化代理：假设生成、数据工程、实验设计与执行、结果解释与政策建议。

Result: 框架旨在提高研究的严谨性、透明度和包容性，推动人机协作。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用AI增强的工作流程，扩展参与、提升可重复性，实现更包容的城市因果推理。

Abstract: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of
cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the
inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data
complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how
urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban
causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data
sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then
introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four
distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data
engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with
policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and
transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity,
and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces
AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to
broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms
of urban causal reasoning.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在数学推理方面的能力，探索其在教育环境中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用芬兰高中毕业考试（高风险的数字化测试）对多种LLMs进行数学能力评估。

Result: 初期表现中等，但随着模型进化，部分模型达到接近满分或满分，媲美顶尖学生水平。

Conclusion: LLMs的数学能力快速进步，展示了其在大规模教育评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational
settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This
study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish
matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary
education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to
mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements
as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect
or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for
university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the
mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential to also support
educational assessments at scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将病例报告转化为结构化时间序列数据的系统，对比了人工和大型语言模型（LLM）的标注效果，发现LLM在事件召回率上表现中等，但在时间一致性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中缺乏关键时间数据，临床报告也缺乏结构化时间信息，阻碍了患者轨迹分析和预测。

Method: 开发了一个系统，将病例报告转化为文本时间序列数据，并对比了人工和LLM的标注效果。

Result: LLM在事件召回率上表现中等（0.80），但在时间一致性上表现优异（0.95）。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用PubMed开放获取（PMOA）语料库进行时间分析提供了基准。

Abstract: Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient
trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and
causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few
data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal
localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms
case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and
timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations
(n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access
(PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93).
We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but
high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By
establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating
high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA
corpus for temporal analytics.

Result: 框架在多类和多标签分类中分别达到98%和97%的准确率，优于基线模型8%。

Conclusion: AI在公共卫生监测和个性化干预中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Drug overdose remains a critical global health issue, often driven by misuse
of opioids, painkillers, and psychiatric medications. Traditional research
methods face limitations, whereas social media offers real-time insights into
self-reported substance use and overdose symptoms. This study proposes an
AI-driven NLP framework trained on annotated social media data to detect
commonly used drugs and associated overdose symptoms. Using a hybrid annotation
strategy with LLMs and human annotators, we applied traditional ML models,
neural networks, and advanced transformer-based models. Our framework achieved
98% accuracy in multi-class and 97% in multi-label classification,
outperforming baseline models by up to 8%. These findings highlight the
potential of AI for supporting public health surveillance and personalized

Abstract: Validating Large Language Models with ReLM explores the application of formal
languages to evaluate and control Large Language Models (LLMs) for
memorization, bias, and zero-shot performance. Current approaches for
evaluating these types behavior are often slow, imprecise, costly, or introduce
biases of their own, but are necessary due to the importance of this behavior
when productionizing LLMs. This project reproduces key results from the
original ReLM paper and expounds on the approach and applications with an
emphasis on the relevance to the field of systems for machine learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Graph Spectral Clustering with

traditional Term Vector Space (like doc2vec, GloVe, etc.). Solutions for
combinatorial Laplacians and normalized Laplacians are discussed. An
experimental investigation shows the advantages and disadvantages of 6
different solutions proposed in the literature and in this research. The
research demonstrates that GloVe embeddings frequently cause failures of
normalized Laplacian based GSC due to negative similarities. Furthermore,
application of methods curing similarity negativity leads to accuracy
improvement for both combinatorial and normalized Laplacian based GSC. It also
leads to applicability for GloVe embeddings of explanation methods developed
originally bythe authors for Term Vector Space embeddings.

TL;DR: 这篇立场论文提出为LLM训练数据的人力劳动赋予货币价值，并认为补偿数据生产者应是LLM开发中最昂贵的部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练数据的人力劳动成本被忽视，论文旨在量化这一成本并推动公平补偿。

Method: 研究了2016至2024年发布的64个LLM，估算从头生产其训练数据的成本。

Result: 即使保守估计工资，训练数据成本是模型训练成本的10-1000倍，构成LLM提供商的重大财务负担。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁未来研究推动更公平的数据补偿实践。

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly
expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and
engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the
human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an
unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words
sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This
position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that
the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided
to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study
64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay
people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly
conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training
datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models
themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.
In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack
of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions
that could enable fairer practices in the future.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了预训练数据频率与语言模型线性表示之间的关系，发现线性表示的形成与数据频率密切相关，并提出了一种预测预训练数据频率的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解预训练数据如何影响语言模型的线性表示，以改进模型行为。

Method: 分析预训练数据频率与线性表示的关系，训练回归模型预测数据频率。

Result: 线性表示与数据频率高度相关，回归模型能有效预测频率。

Conclusion: 线性表示强度可反映预训练数据特征，为改进模型行为提供新途径。

Abstract: Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language
models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this
relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on
downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM
representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some
concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause
these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data
frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find
evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to
pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact
triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning
accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.
This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we
discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms
when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k
times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during
pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear
representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term
was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a
different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method
for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data
models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains
signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for
controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the
models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

Motivation: 现有自动谬误检测数据集多限于正式语言领域，而在线论坛语言多样且非标准化，难以覆盖。

Method: 提出SLURG方法，利用大型语言模型（如DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B）生成合成谬误论坛评论。

Result: 发现LLMs能复制真实数据的句法模式，高质量少样本提示可增强其模仿论坛词汇多样性的能力。

Conclusion: SLURG方法为在线论坛谬误检测提供了可行性，LLMs在生成合成数据方面具有潜力。

Abstract: In our paper we explore the definition, and extrapolation of fallacies as
they pertain to the automatic detection of manipulation on social media. In
particular we explore how these logical fallacies might appear in the real
world i.e internet forums. We discovered a prevalence of misinformation /
misguided intention in discussion boards specifically centered around the
Ukrainian Russian Conflict which serves to narrow the domain of our task.
Although automatic fallacy detection has gained attention recently, most
datasets use unregulated fallacy taxonomies or are limited to formal linguistic
domains like political debates or news reports. Online discourse, however,
often features non-standardized and diverse language not captured in these
domains. We present Shady Linguistic Utterance Replication-Generation (SLURG)
to address these limitations, exploring the feasibility of generating synthetic
fallacious forum-style comments using large language models (LLMs),
specifically DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B. Our findings indicate that LLMs can
replicate the syntactic patterns of real data} and that high-quality few-shot
prompts enhance LLMs' ability to mimic the vocabulary diversity of online
forums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本属性图（TAGs）中同时捕捉节点文本语义和结构依赖的挑战，弥补GNN和LLM各自的不足。

Method: 提出BiGTex架构，通过堆叠的Graph-Text Fusion Units实现双向注意力机制，结合LoRA进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，BiGTex在节点分类和链接预测任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BiGTex通过双向融合和软提示技术，显著提升了文本属性图的表示学习能力。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation
learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of
node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph
neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the
capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs)
are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph
structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel
architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text
Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and
structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions,
text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The
proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA),
keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves
state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively
to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft
prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Result: 新代理指标将相对性能预测误差率降低了50%以上，并在特定场景中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 研究为优化预训练方案以适配不同下游任务提供了更高效的设计路径。

Abstract: While metrics available during pre-training, such as perplexity, correlate
well with model performance at scaling-laws studies, their predictive
capacities at a fixed model size remain unclear, hindering effective model
selection and development. To address this gap, we formulate the task of
selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning
performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs,
differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants
with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or
data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct
a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading
indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy
metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative
performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity
of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training
schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 混合NLP框架可行，使先进方法更适用于计算资源有限的医疗机构。

Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly in demand in both
clinical research and operational practice. However, most of the
state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high
computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP
framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining
accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study
involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1
billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision
of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP
approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data
methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single
machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid
NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art
methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational
resources.

Abstract: Working with documents is a key part of almost any knowledge work, from
contextualizing research in a literature review to reviewing legal precedent.
Recently, as their capabilities have expanded, primarily text-based NLP systems
have often been billed as able to assist or even automate this kind of work.
But to what extent are these systems able to model these tasks as experts
conceptualize and perform them now? In this study, we interview sixteen domain
experts across two domains to understand their processes of document research,
and compare it to the current state of NLP systems. We find that our
participants processes are idiosyncratic, iterative, and rely extensively on
the social context of a document in addition its content; existing approaches
in NLP and adjacent fields that explicitly center the document as an object,
rather than as merely a container for text, tend to better reflect our
participants' priorities, though they are often less accessible outside their
research communities. We call on the NLP community to more carefully consider
the role of the document in building useful tools that are accessible,
personalizable, iterative, and socially aware.

*Alexander Shypula,Shuo Li,Botong Zhang,Vishakh Padmakumar,Kayo Yin,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，偏好调优技术（如RLHF、PPO、GRPO和DPO）虽降低词汇和句法多样性，但提高了有效语义多样性，因生成更多高质量输出而非增加多样性。小模型在固定采样预算下更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决偏好调优技术减少多样性的问题，提出有效语义多样性框架以更实用地衡量LLM输出多样性。

Method: 通过无需人工干预的开放式任务，比较偏好调优模型与SFT或基础模型在词汇、句法和语义多样性上的表现。

Result: 偏好调优模型（尤其是RL训练）在语义多样性上表现更好，但句法多样性降低。小模型在生成独特内容上更高效。

Conclusion: 偏好调优在保持语义多样性同时减少句法多样性，为需要高质量多样输出的应用提供新见解。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including
Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO,
as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given
that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs.
To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic
diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better
reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using
open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive
results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via
RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater
effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing
diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality
outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity
while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity
in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our
analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more
parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling
budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and
diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that
require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic
data generation.

### [46] [Memorization vs. Reasoning: Updating LLMs with New Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12523)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了知识更新平台（KUP）和记忆条件训练（MCT）方法，用于解决大语言模型（LLMs）知识更新的挑战。KUP提供自动化的知识更新评估框架，MCT通过记忆标记提升模型对新知识的记忆和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对实体替换，无法全面反映复杂现实动态，因此需要更有效的知识更新方法和评估框架。

Method: 提出KUP作为自动化知识更新模拟管道，并开发MCT方法，通过在训练中引入记忆标记来增强模型对新知识的记忆和推理。

Result: KUP基准测试显示现有方法在推理任务上表现较差（<2%），而MCT在记忆任务上显著优于基线方法（提升25.4%）。

Conclusion: KUP和MCT为LLMs的知识更新提供了有效工具，尤其在记忆和推理任务上表现突出。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in
their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a
challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity
substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an
automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an
evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect
probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for
any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called
memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus
on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs
to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results
on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the
best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and
(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)
baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从LLMs中提取整本书的可能性，使用Llama 3 70B模型和“前缀提示”技术，成功高相似度地重构了《爱丽丝梦游仙境》，并发现提取率与书籍流行度相关。同时，研究发现指令调优的Llama 3.1中缓解措施失效，且这种失效源于少数权重变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是探索LLMs中书籍内容的提取能力，以及当前缓解策略的局限性。

Method: 使用Llama 3 70B模型和“前缀提示”技术，通过自回归方式重构书籍内容。

Result: 成功提取了《爱丽丝梦游仙境》等书籍，提取率与书籍流行度相关；发现Llama 3.1中缓解措施失效。

Conclusion: 当前缓解策略存在局限性，研究为理解微调对LLMs记忆提取的影响提供了框架。

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B
family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able
to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one
entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.
We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,
piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We
show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,
likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama
3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this
undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated
primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the
limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework
for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in
aligned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估框架未充分考虑波斯语言和文化背景，需开发适应性的评估方法。

Method: 通过翻译现有数据集、生成合成数据及收集自然数据，构建了三种波斯语基准数据集（如ProhibiBench-fa、SafeBench-fa等），并开发了统一评估框架。

Result: 系统评估了波斯LLMs在安全性、公平性和社会规范三个方面的表现，并公开了排行榜。

Conclusion: 该框架为波斯LLMs的文化适应性评估提供了新方法，促进了伦理对齐研究的发展。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for aligning Persian
Large Language Models (LLMs) with critical ethical dimensions, including
safety, fairness, and social norms. It addresses the gaps in existing LLM
evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural
contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks:
(i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new
naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench,
HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create
ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets
to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we
collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms.
By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for
evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded
alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed
across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness
(mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted
behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian
LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at:

TL;DR: CDF-RAG框架通过动态反馈和因果推理改进RAG，提升生成回答的因果一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架依赖语义相似性检索，难以区分真实因果关系与虚假关联，导致回答不完整或误导。

Method: CDF-RAG通过迭代优化查询、检索因果图、多跳因果推理及验证因果路径，确保逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，CDF-RAG在回答准确性和因果正确性上优于现有RAG方法。

Conclusion: CDF-RAG显著提升了生成回答的因果一致性和解释性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced large
language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external
knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks primarily rely on
semantic similarity and correlation-driven retrieval, limiting their ability to
distinguish true causal relationships from spurious associations. This results
in responses that may be factually grounded but fail to establish
cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. To
address this issue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improve
causal consistency, factual accuracy, and explainability in generative
reasoning. CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves structured causal
graphs, and enables multi-hop causal reasoning across interconnected knowledge
sources. Additionally, it validates responses against causal pathways, ensuring
logically coherent and factually grounded outputs. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four
diverse datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve response accuracy and
causal correctness over existing RAG-based methods. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/ elakhatibi/CDF-RAG.

TL;DR: MetaSynth通过元提示生成多样性合成数据，成功将Mistral-7B-v0.3适配到金融和生物医学领域，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何利用合成数据适配特定领域，解决现有合成数据多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出MetaSynth方法，通过元提示协调多个专家LLM代理生成多样性合成数据。

Result: 仅用2500万token的合成数据，模型在金融和生物医学领域分别提升4.08%和13.75%。

Conclusion: MetaSynth生成的多样性合成数据可有效用于领域适配，无需混合真实数据。

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data
generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging
synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.
A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts
its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we
propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances
diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple
"expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million
tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a
well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and
Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in
general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data
using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM
pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms
the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in
Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data
generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior
generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest
that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real
data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

*Liyi Zhang,Veniamin Veselovsky,R. Thomas McCoy,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在某些确定性任务中表现不佳，但通过干预可以改善其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在确定性任务中表现不佳，因其隐式先验分布影响了响应。本文旨在探索如何通过干预让LLM更好地利用其内部信息。

Method: 通过提示LLM不依赖先验知识，并使用机制解释技术定位和调整先验影响。

Result: 干预显著提升了性能，且微调后错误不再与先验相关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可以通过操纵LLM对先验的依赖来提升其在易产生幻觉的任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to
deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the
implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens
influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,
LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,
and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this
information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting
the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic
improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability
techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to
which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is
possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate
with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of
these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high
performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information
required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations
of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning
is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error
after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent
to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially
increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons
related to the prior probability of token sequences.

TL;DR: GeoSense是一个新的双语基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的几何推理能力，发现现有模型在几何原理识别和应用上存在瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估MLLMs在几何问题解决（GPS）中的视觉理解和符号推理能力，GeoSense填补了这一空白。

Method: GeoSense采用五级几何原理层次框架、1,789个标注问题和创新评估策略，系统测试MLLMs的几何推理能力。

Result: Gemini-2.0-pro-flash表现最佳，总体得分65.3，但几何原理的识别和应用仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoSense为提升MLLMs的几何推理能力提供了方向，推动更接近人类推理的人工智能发展。

Abstract: Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual
comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong
reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive
application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing
benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric
reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their
ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first
comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric
principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric
principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset
of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive
experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we
observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of
$65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application
of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly
hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's
potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning
capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能捕捉个体层面的主观性，特别是在社交媒体用户的道德判断中。

Method: 提出SOLAR框架，通过分析用户生成文本中的价值冲突和权衡，推断个体的主观立场。

Result: 实验表明SOLAR提高了推理结果的整体性能，尤其在争议情境下表现更优，并能解释个体的价值偏好。

Conclusion: SOLAR框架能有效捕捉和解释个体的主观性，为LLMs在主观决策任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems
but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective
decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be
subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account
for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this
paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer
their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective
Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in
the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals.
Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as
well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively
show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences,
which can further account for their judgments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的后训练合成数据生成策略，用于扩展LLMs的上下文窗口，解决了长上下文数据稀缺和计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在长上下文推理中存在困难，主要由于计算复杂度随序列长度平方增长，且长上下文数据稀缺且昂贵。

Method: 采用后训练合成数据生成策略和逐步旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）扩展训练策略，支持任意长上下文。

Result: 模型在1M tokens的上下文长度下，在RULER和InfiniteBench上表现良好，同时保持通用语言任务的稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长上下文数据稀缺问题，并显著提升了LLMs的长上下文推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only
due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length
but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data.
There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates
long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset
with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend
the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our
approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by
the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the
scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position
embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with
a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and
InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.

Conclusion: Persona-judge为自适应定制对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant
challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring
excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and
additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to
diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge,
a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized
alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters
through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic
preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model
generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge
model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens
whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge,
using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a
scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment,
paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ACoRN的抽象压缩方法，通过更细粒度的文档分类和两种新的训练步骤，提升压缩模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，从而提高检索增强生成（RAG）的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索到的文档常包含无关或误导性信息，导致抽象压缩模型忽略关键内容，影响答案准确性。

Method: 1. 使用离线数据增强提升模型对噪声的鲁棒性；2. 通过微调生成围绕关键信息的摘要，减少位置偏差。

Result: 实验显示，ACoRN训练的T5-large模型在EM和F1分数上表现更优，且能保留答案的直接证据。

Conclusion: ACoRN在噪声较多的数据集上表现优异，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense
query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is
either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect
content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that
abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential
for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion
occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more
fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise
(ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data
augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against
two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased
compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents
and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries
centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our
experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor,
improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve
as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing
documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: GRAIL是一种新型多领域遗忘框架，通过梯度信息精准区分遗忘与保留范围，选择性移除敏感信息同时保留关键知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）可能学习敏感信息，现有单领域遗忘方法无法处理多领域交织的知识，导致过度删除或性能下降。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，利用多领域梯度信息自适应定位参数，选择性移除目标知识。

Result: 实验表明GRAIL在遗忘效果上与现有方法相当，知识保留能力提升17%。

Conclusion: GRAIL为大规模预训练语言模型中的敏感信息管理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn
sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under
principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from
scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical.
Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address
multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as
privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to
excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we
propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain
unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple
domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope,
and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively
remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.
Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves
unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also
demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the
previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for
effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale
pre-trained language models.

Motivation: 开源与闭源模型在代码生成任务中存在性能差距，现有方法通过生成大量合成数据微调，但效率低下。

Method: 采用数据选择策略优先复杂数据并保持分布一致，结合动态打包技术优化分词以减少计算资源消耗。

Result: 在40%数据上训练时，DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B性能达66.9%，优于全数据训练的66.1%，训练时间从47分钟降至34分钟。

Conclusion: 通过优化数据选择和分词，模型性能和训练效率均得到提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code
generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source
and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically
generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to
inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in
order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based
LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset
aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy
effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the
tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes
padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental
results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the
DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%,
surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time
is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases
from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are
observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By
optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves
model performance but also improves training efficiency.

Motivation: LLMs经常生成偏离事实或上下文的幻觉内容，诊断其成因复杂，因此需要系统化的方法来理解和追踪幻觉。

Method: 通过子序列嵌入模型的理论分析，提出了一种追踪算法，通过随机化输入上下文分析幻觉概率，识别因果子序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在识别幻觉成因方面优于标准归因技术，并与模型训练语料库的证据一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为幻觉现象提供了统一视角，并建立了稳健的追踪和分析框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that
deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for
diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper
introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and
understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when
dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical
and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers
effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers
encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that
identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across
randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard
attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with
evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified
perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and
analysis.

TL;DR: Pandora提出了一种基于Python Pandas API的统一知识推理框架，通过生成文本推理步骤和可执行代码，提升了多任务知识推理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以实现不同结构化知识推理任务间的知识迁移或与大型语言模型对齐，限制了性能。

Method: 利用Python Pandas API构建统一知识表示，结合LLM生成推理步骤和代码，并通过训练示例库促进知识迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Pandora优于现有统一框架，并与任务专用方法竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora通过统一表示和LLM对齐，显著提升了结构化知识推理的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and
knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on
employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which
struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or
align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper
proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage
of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge
representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to
generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.
Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various
SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora}
outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with
task-specific methods.

*Fatma Elsafoury,David Hartmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语言模型对全球边缘群体的偏见问题，特别关注了阿拉伯国家、德国、英国和美国中的270个边缘群体，并指出低资源语言和方言对偏见研究的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型偏见研究主要集中在英语世界，忽视了全球许多边缘群体和低资源语言，导致模型的不公平性。

Method: 研究了23种语言模型对270个边缘群体的偏见，并比较了埃及阿拉伯方言与现代标准阿拉伯语对偏见测量的影响。

Result: 发现语言模型对许多边缘群体表现出更高偏见，但阿拉伯语模型在宗教和种族方面对边缘和主流群体均表现出高偏见。此外，非二元性别、LGBTQIA+和黑人女性面临更高的交叉偏见。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁扩展偏见研究的范围，纳入更多边缘群体和低资源语言，以开发更具包容性的语言模型。

Abstract: We know that language models (LMs) form biases and stereotypes of minorities,
leading to unfair treatments of members of these groups, thanks to research
mainly in the US and the broader English-speaking world. As the negative
behavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals,
industry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in
LMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have
been overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to
individual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but
crucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN
estimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members
of marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to
develop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our
understanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource
languages and dialects.
  In this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating
offensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt,
the remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of
bias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we
measure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus
Modern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against
many marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups. However, this is not
the case for Arabic LMs, where the bias is high against both marginalized and
dominant groups in relation to religion and ethnicity.
  Our results also show higher intersectional bias against Non-binary, LGBTQIA+
and Black women.

TL;DR: GeoGen是一个自动生成几何问题分步解答的流程，结合符号推理生成大规模高质量数据，并训练GeoLogic模型以提升MLLMs在几何推理中的逻辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在几何问题解决（GPS）中面临缺乏分步解答数据和推理幻觉的挑战。

Method: 提出GeoGen流程自动生成几何问题的分步推理路径，并训练GeoLogic模型结合符号系统验证MLLM输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了MLLMs在几何推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLMs和符号系统的优势，实现了更可靠和可解释的几何问题解决方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal
mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving
(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data
and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a
pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for
geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,
\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To
further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train
\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated
by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,
GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the
reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,
achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This
improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic
systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS
task. Codes are available at https://github.com/ycpNotFound/GeoGen.

*Takaya Arita,Wenxian Zheng,Reiji Suzuki,Fuminori Akiba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在艺术评论和心智理论（ToM）任务中的表现，发现通过精心设计的提示，LLMs能生成接近人类水平的评论，并在复杂情境中展现出一定的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在艺术评论和心智理论任务中的表现，以评估其是否能在缺乏真实理解的情况下生成专家级输出。

Method: 结合Noel Carroll的评价框架与多种艺术批评理论，生成艺术评论并进行图灵测试；设计新的ToM任务测试LLMs在复杂情境中的推理能力。

Result: LLMs生成的艺术评论在风格和解释力上接近人类，ToM任务中表现因模型和任务而异，情感或模糊情境下差异更明显。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定提示下能表现出接近理解的复杂行为，但其认知局限性仍存在，提示设计对表现至关重要。

Abstract: This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas
related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states
(Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation
part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with
a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first
write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a
step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared
with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many
cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results
suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style
but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the
second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving
interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of
art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,
socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that
their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that
involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer
differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to
complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations
and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called
Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output
without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are
instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin
to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might
assume.

TL;DR: SMARTe提出了一种基于槽注意力机制的可解释关系三元组抽取方法，性能与现有最优模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法侧重于优化模型性能，但缺乏对内部机制的理解，且依赖复杂预处理导致系统不透明。

Method: 采用槽注意力机制，将任务视为集合预测问题，通过槽整合相关信息，确保预测可追溯。

Result: 在NYT和WebNLG数据集上验证了性能不逊于最优模型，并通过注意力热图展示解释性。

Conclusion: SMARTe在保持性能的同时增强了可解释性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing
model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms
driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to
induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not
fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations,
we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple
extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot
attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot
attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all
predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the
tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing
interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding
interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted
qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using
attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a
discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLRBench是一个新的多语言长上下文推理基准测试，旨在解决现有基准测试的局限性，通过评估多跳推理、聚合和认知推理等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注信息检索能力，而忽略了推理能力，且易受数据泄漏等问题影响。

Method: MLRBench通过合成任务评估多语言长上下文推理能力，涵盖七种语言，并设计为并行、抗泄漏和可扩展。

Result: 实验显示高资源和低资源语言间存在显著差距，LLMs在多语言环境中仅能有效利用不到30%的上下文长度。

Conclusion: MLRBench开源以促进多语言LLMs的评估和训练研究，现有检索增强生成方法未能完全解决长上下文问题。

Abstract: Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular
needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate
specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a
retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful
recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended
contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,
short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To
address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for
multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes
beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop
inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,
MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to
arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large
language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource
languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple
facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual
settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context
length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate
this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We
open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and
training of multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: ViClaim是一个多语言、多主题的视频转录数据集，用于检测视频中的虚假信息，填补了现有研究中口语文本分析的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容在传播和虚假信息中的作用日益重要，但现有研究主要关注书面文本，缺乏对视频转录中口语复杂性的分析。

Method: 构建了包含1,798个标注视频转录的ViClaim数据集，涵盖三种语言和六个主题，并开发了专用标注工具。使用多语言语言模型进行实验。

Result: 模型在交叉验证中表现良好（宏F1达0.896），但在未见主题上泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: ViClaim为视频虚假信息检测提供了重要基础，揭示了口语文本分析的复杂性。

Abstract: The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and
misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze
claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in
misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant
gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We
introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three
languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the
transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy,
fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to
facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with
state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in
cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization
to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the
complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust
foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication,
addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents
as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in
machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and
analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on
how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent
systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,
which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured
manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high
accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate
the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study
in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized
AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and
(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the
potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual
awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent
systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent
applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and
shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）在推理时可能捕获数据集偏差，导致泛化能力差。传统的基于先验知识的去偏方法和基于上下文学习的自动去偏方法效果有限。

Method: 提出IGCIDB框架，首先利用信息增益引导的因果干预方法自动平衡指令调整数据集的分布，然后通过标准监督微调训练LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，IGCIDB能有效去偏，提升LLMs在不同任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IGCIDF框架为解决LLMs的偏差问题提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large
language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during
inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the
diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression
based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior
knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic
debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the
combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an
information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This
framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method
to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of
instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised
fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results
show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability
across different tasks.

Conclusion: NaVAB为LLMs与国家价值观对齐提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于模型更好地适应不同国家的政策、法律和道德要求。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) hold positions that conflict with your
country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus
on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which
encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current
benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires
are not easily scalable.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark
to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China,
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a
national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment
datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction
tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter
value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction
mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on
various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting
in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that
NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value
concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

Motivation: 当前指令调优方法在扩展数据生成时忽视了指令与响应的对齐，而高质量的对齐对模型性能至关重要。

Method: 提出互对齐框架（MAIN），通过互约束确保指令与响应的连贯性。

Result: 实验表明，基于MAIN调优的LLaMA和Mistral模型在多个基准测试中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 指令与响应的对齐是实现高质量、可扩展指令调优的关键因素。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve
remarkable performance, but its success heavily depends on the availability of
large-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, current methods
for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment
between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that high-quality
instruction-response pairs are not defined by the individual quality of each
component, but by the extent of their alignment with each other. To address
this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) that ensures coherence
between the instruction and response through mutual constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that models such as LLaMA and Mistral, fine-tuned within this
framework, outperform traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. This
approach underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in
enabling scalable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, an approach for concept extraction from documents using

just the important ones. Through comprehensive evaluations of two widely used
benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves the F1 score
compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we explore the potential
of using prompts within these models for unsupervised concept extraction. The
extracted concepts are intended to support domain coverage evaluation of

Result: 简单重试方法常优于复杂推理框架，表明复杂策略的计算成本未必合理。

Conclusion: 挑战了复杂推理策略必然更优的假设，为高效方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the
development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable
performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has
spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A
recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs
through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies
require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and
correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In
this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an
embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks
by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect
answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not
require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the
refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches
often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the
benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs.
By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning
strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights
into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So,
are retrials all you need?

Method: 结合检索增强系统和长上下文模型，通过生成银参考数据估计最优检索长度。

Result: 在多文档摘要任务中表现出色，优于RULER和HELMET等基准。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于不同规模和类型的语言模型，并能推广到新模型类别。

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context reasoning abilities of language models led to
interesting applications in large-scale multi-document summarization. However,
prior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their
claimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an
efficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly
sensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a
hybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context
windows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the
optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and
dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LLMs to
generate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to
estimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our
results on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of
our method across model classes and sizes. We compare against length estimates
from strong long-context benchmarks such as RULER and HELMET. Our analysis also
highlights the effectiveness of our estimation method for very long-context LMs
and its generalization to new classes of LMs.

TL;DR: HypoGen是首个用于科学假设生成（SHG）的数据集，包含5500个结构化问题-假设对，采用Bit-Flip-Spark框架，并通过微调语言模型提升假设的新颖性和可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在生成新颖且可行的科学假设方面存在不足，缺乏专门的数据集将SHG任务形式化为自然语言生成（NLG）任务。

Method: 提出HypoGen数据集，采用Bit-Flip-Spark框架（Bit为传统假设，Spark为关键洞察，Flip为反提案），并引入显式推理链（Chain-of-Reasoning）。通过微调语言模型，仅输入Bit生成假设。

Result: 实验表明，HypoGen数据集显著提升了生成假设的新颖性、可行性和整体质量，并通过自动指标和LLM评估验证。

Conclusion: HypoGen为科学假设生成提供了有效的数据集和方法，推动了AI在科学创新中的应用。

Abstract: Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in
achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models
have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation
of scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often
struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One
reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis
Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we
introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured
problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences
structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional
assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is
the resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit
Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to
Flip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language
modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the
Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to
improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs
automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We
show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty,
feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen
dataset is publicly available at
huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识冲突中的表现，提出了一种名为Swin-VIB的新框架，通过变分信息瓶颈模型优化检索信息增强和LLM偏好引导，显著提升了任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在信息检索系统中面临内部记忆与外部检索信息之间的知识冲突，导致响应可靠性下降和决策不确定性增加。

Method: 从信息论角度分析LLMs如何处理知识冲突，提出Swin-VIB框架，结合变分信息瓶颈模型自适应增强检索信息并引导LLM偏好。

Result: 实验验证了理论发现，Swin-VIB在单选择、开放式问答和检索增强生成任务中表现优异，单选择任务准确率提升至少7.54%。

Conclusion: Swin-VIB有效解决了LLMs的知识冲突问题，提升了响应生成的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在训练中常记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘方法难以选择性删除数据关联而不损害模型性能。

Method: 通过因果追踪实验识别关键层（0-5层），并开发了一种约束优化方法，冻结上层并对下层应用联合损失函数。

Result: 在1B模型赛道中排名第二，保持88%的基线MMLU准确性。

Conclusion: 因果导向的层优化为LLM高效精确遗忘提供了新范式，显著推进了AI系统中的数据隐私问题解决。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during
training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current
machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data
associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents
our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a
two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with
layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on
OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the
first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute
associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a
constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a
novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set
loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set
deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the
1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of
baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer
optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs,
offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理学多模态大语言模型因数据限制缺乏对完整临床上下文的理解，开发WSI级模型具有重要应用价值。

Method: 使用TCGA的10,094对WSI和病理报告构建检索式数据生成管道，并设计AI评估协议验证模型能力。

Result: 模型在1,134对WSI和报告中达到62.9%的接受率，能够理解多种癌症类型的WSI和临床上下文。

Conclusion: ChatEXAONEPath通过多模态整合，有望辅助临床医生全面理解复杂病理形态，提升癌症诊断能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language
models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions
and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical
scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various
modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex
clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies
have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer
questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical
context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public
datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the
scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we
introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as
ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using
10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive
understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and
evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We
demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using
ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and
reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context
from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential
to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of
WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了框架的优越性能，有效缓解了标记限制问题。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅性能优异，还能显著减少标记限制带来的挑战。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific
aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of
traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have
shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely
excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination
challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization:
Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely
on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven
retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach
extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby
mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes
token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model
generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves
superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation
problem.

TL;DR: 研究发现，深度学习模型的技术准确性与专家一致性之间存在反比关系，而大语言模型（LLMs）虽准确度较低，但与专家更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度学习模型在安全关键NLP应用中的评估标准，强调仅依赖准确性不足。

Method: 评估五种DL模型和四种LLMs，使用Cohen's Kappa、PCA和SHAP技术分析模型与专家的一致性。

Result: 技术准确性高的模型与专家一致性低，LLMs更依赖上下文和时间线索，与专家更一致。

Conclusion: 建议将专家一致性作为模型评估的补充指标，并认为LLMs在事故分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between deep learning (DL) model
accuracy and expert agreement in the classification of crash narratives. We
evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and
narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models
(LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive
trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with
domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite
relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert
agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned
models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than
location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is
insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We
advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model
evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable,
scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统通常单独处理模糊查询或噪声信息，无法同时应对多种冲突因素。本文旨在通过多代理辩论和综合数据集填补这一空白。

Method: 提出RAMDocs数据集模拟复杂冲突场景，并设计MADAM-RAG方法，通过多轮代理辩论整合有效答案并剔除错误信息。

Result: MADAM-RAG在AmbigDocs和FaithEval上分别提升11.40%和15.80%性能，但RAMDocs仍对现有基线构成挑战（Llama3.3-70B-Instruct仅得32.60分）。

Conclusion: MADAM-RAG初步解决了多因素冲突问题，但在证据不平衡情况下仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their
responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous
user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant
documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in
isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or
robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors
simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and
Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and
realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including
ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent
approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple
rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to
disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby
handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which
requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over
strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires
suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with
Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for
existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match
score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our
analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing
the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

Result: 实验表明，EBRM在安全关键对齐任务中性能提升5.97%，并能有效延迟奖励破解。

Conclusion: EBRM是一种可扩展且高效的方法，适用于现有奖励模型和对齐流程的增强。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex
human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges,
we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc
refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM
models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human
preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It
achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware
contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs
without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across
different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate
significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to
a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard
RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined
rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These
results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for
existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Motivation: 许多语言模型应用需要生成符合语法或语义约束的文本，但传统方法难以精确生成这种分布。

Result: 在Python代码生成、文本转SQL等任务中，小模型性能超越大模型8倍以上，且更接近后验分布。

Conclusion: SMC框架为控制生成问题提供了简单、可编程的解决方案，显著提升性能。

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution
-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for
controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC
framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific
constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational
resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By
comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains
-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and
molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach
allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,
as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic
perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better
approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework
of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic
programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a
broad variety of controlled generation problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化框架CLIMB，用于优化预训练数据混合，通过聚类和迭代搜索提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据集通常缺乏明确的领域划分，手动标注成本高，因此需要一种自动化方法来优化数据混合。

Method: CLIMB通过语义空间嵌入和聚类大规模数据集，利用代理模型和预测器迭代搜索最优数据混合。

Result: 在400B tokens上训练的1B模型性能超过Llama-3.2-1B 2.0%，特定领域优化提升5%。

Conclusion: CLIMB框架有效优化数据混合，并提供了ClimbLab和ClimbMix数据集供研究使用。

Abstract: Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack
inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl
do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets
such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal
pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its
significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,
we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an
automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a
pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale
datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures
using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B
tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art
Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific
domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.
Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20
clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful
400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers
superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data
mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data

Motivation: 为临床提供精确、数据支持的治疗指南，改善2型糖尿病患者的治疗效果。

Method: 使用机器学习优化数据，训练树模型生成治疗建议，并在外部数据集上验证。

Result: 模型在BMC和Hartford数据上分别比医生表现好0.26%和0.13%。

Conclusion: AI方法高效且可解释，有望改善当前临床实践。

Abstract: Objective: Create precise, structured, data-backed guidelines for type 2
diabetes treatment progression, suitable for clinical adoption.
  Research Design and Methods: Our training cohort was composed of patient
(with type 2 diabetes) visits from Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1998 to
2014. We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen
before the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the
recommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational
data, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more
aggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove
some datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On
each subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment
changes. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for
every group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in
that group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive
treatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline
on unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type
2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).
  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more
than what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford
cohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.
  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to
treatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current
practice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent

natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular
design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline
orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented

iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables
users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML
pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation,
all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the
accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML
tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other
platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and
demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and
lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.

### [90] [Heuristic Recognition and Rapid Response to Unfamiliar Events Outside of Agent Design Scope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12497)
*Robert E. Wray,Steven J. Jones,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了开放世界中智能体如何应对超出其设计范围的陌生情境，提出了一种结合元知识和元推理的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界中的智能体常面临超出其经验或模型的情境，且缺乏足够时间评估和应对，需快速、合理地适应。

Method: 结合领域通用的元知识（受人类认知启发的评估）和元推理，以快速生成适应性响应。

Result: 该方法有望为开放世界中的通用智能体提供更快速、更适应的响应能力。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法通过元知识和元推理的结合，为智能体在开放世界中的适应性提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Regardless of past learning, an agent in an open world will face unfamiliar
situations and events outside of prior experience, existing models, or
policies. Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or
sufficient time to assess the situation, generate and evaluate options, and
pursue a robustly considered course of action. How can an agent respond
reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can
it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine
reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed
for solutions, evaluate the state-of-the-art by these requirements, and outline
a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (in the
form of appraisals inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. It has the
potential to provide fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more
fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general
agents.

*Zahra Atf,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI系统的可解释性与用户信任之间存在显著但中等的正相关关系，但可解释性并非唯一或主要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI可解释性是否真正提升用户信任，并分析其社会技术意义。

Method: 采用元分析方法，综合分析了90项研究的数据。

Result: 可解释性与用户信任呈中等正相关，但其他因素如算法偏见和伦理透明度同样重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要关注AI系统的真实可信赖性，而不仅仅是短期信任。

Abstract: This study critically examines the commonly held assumption that
explicability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems inherently boosts user
trust. Utilizing a meta-analytical approach, we conducted a comprehensive
examination of the existing literature to explore the relationship between AI
explainability and trust. Our analysis, incorporating data from 90 studies,
reveals a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between
the explainability of AI systems and the trust they engender among users. This
indicates that while explainability contributes to building trust, it is not
the sole or predominant factor in this equation. In addition to academic
contributions to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), this research highlights
its broader socio-technical implications, particularly in promoting
accountability and fostering user trust in critical domains such as healthcare
and justice. By addressing challenges like algorithmic bias and ethical
transparency, the study underscores the need for equitable and sustainable AI
adoption. Rather than focusing solely on immediate trust, we emphasize the
normative importance of fostering authentic and enduring trustworthiness in AI
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroSumEval是一种基于竞争的新型评估协议，通过零和游戏动态评估大语言模型（LLMs），避免传统方法的过拟合、高成本和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如静态数据集、人工评估或基于模型的评估）存在过拟合、高成本和偏见问题，需要一种更动态和标准化的评估框架。

Method: ZeroSumEval通过设计多样化的游戏（如安全挑战、经典游戏、知识测试和说服挑战）动态评估LLMs，实验涵盖7000多次模拟、7种游戏和13种模型。

Result: 前沿模型（如GPT和Claude系列）在常见游戏和问答中表现良好，但在需要创造力和新颖问题的游戏中表现不佳，且无法可靠地互相破解。

Conclusion: ZeroSumEval提供了一个标准化且可扩展的框架，有效评估LLMs的多种能力，揭示了模型在创造力任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally
relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based
evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and
biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that
leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist
saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including
security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker),
knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These
games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic
reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon
recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for
LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and
extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments
with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that
while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games
and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel
and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably
jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We
release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.

*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于符号编年史的多智能体生成内容溯源系统，用于追踪生成历史，无需依赖内部状态或外部元信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI多智能体协作生成内容的复杂性增加，追踪内容的生成历史变得困难，需要一种无需依赖额外信息的溯源方法。

Method: 提出了一种符号编年史系统，通过时间戳和签名记录生成历史，并通过反馈循环更新编年史。

Result: 系统能够从生成内容中追溯历史，实现多智能体协作的透明化。

Conclusion: 该研究为协作AI提供了一种可追溯的生成历史方法，增强了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental
pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the
flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous
agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of
generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation,
where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a
multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,
often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we
investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal
dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc
attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on
internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the
notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in
a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system
operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the
chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content
in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable
form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.

TL;DR: Embodied-R框架结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和小型语言模型（LM），通过强化学习实现高效的空间推理能力，仅用5k样本训练即达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练模型如何通过视觉观察获取高级空间推理能力。

Method: 结合VLM和LM，使用强化学习（RL）及新颖的奖励系统（注重逻辑一致性），实现慢思考能力。

Result: 在5k样本训练后，3B参数的LM在空间推理任务上匹配SOTA模型（如OpenAI-o1、Gemini-2.5-pro），并展现出系统性分析和上下文整合能力。

Conclusion: Embodied-R展示了高效推理潜力，并探讨了奖励设计、模型泛化等研究问题。

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential
visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained
models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains
unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining
large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale
Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model
achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After
training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches
state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.
Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis
and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including
response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences
in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了WebLists基准和BardeenAgent框架，用于解决大规模结构化数据提取任务，显著提升了性能并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理研究主要关注导航和交易任务，而大规模结构化数据提取任务的研究较少。

Method: 提出BardeenAgent框架，通过将执行转化为可重复程序并利用HTML的规则结构，实现高效数据提取。

Result: BardeenAgent在WebLists基准上实现了66%的召回率，性能是现有最佳代理的两倍，成本降低3倍。

Conclusion: BardeenAgent为大规模结构化数据提取任务提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction
tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present
WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business
and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,
configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined
schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents
struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite
higher performance on question-answering tasks.
  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that
enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and
replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also
the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In
particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all
relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.
  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more
than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output
row by 3x.

*Zheng Wang,Shu Xian Teo,Jun Jie Chew,Wei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InstructRAG提出了一种基于多智能体元强化学习框架的新方法，通过结合检索增强生成（RAG）解决任务规划中的可扩展性和可迁移性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于TAO过程的方法受限于LLMs对复杂任务知识的不足，RAG提供了利用外部数据库增强生成的机会。

Method: InstructRAG采用多智能体框架，包括组织历史指令路径的图结构、扩展覆盖的RL-Agent和提升任务泛化的ML-Agent。

Result: 在四个任务规划数据集上，InstructRAG表现优于现有方法，性能提升达19.2%。

Conclusion: InstructRAG显著提升了任务规划的效率和适应性，为复杂任务规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as
agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a
thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these
approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex
tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by
leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In
this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)
in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution
within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these
challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths
(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to
expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to
improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained
end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four
widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly
enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a
19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFT方法在复杂子任务中表现不佳，而专家失败轨迹中可能包含有价值的信息。

Method: 提出EEF方法，从失败轨迹中提取有益动作并整合到训练数据中，同时排除有害动作。

Result: EEF在WebShop中达到62%胜率，优于RFT和GPT-4，并在SciWorld中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: EEF通过利用专家失败信息，显著提升了代理在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents,
excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions.
Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for
finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful
trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning
on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g.,
GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler
scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently
out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we
discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide
valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve
agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which
identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates
them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously
excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging
the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some
previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance.
Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT
(53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new
state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and
exceed 81 in SciWorld.

Motivation: 前沿模型生成的推理轨迹可能被用于模型蒸馏，模型拥有者需要一种方法在不损害性能的前提下限制蒸馏的有效性。

Method: 采用抗蒸馏采样策略，通过修改模型的下一个令牌概率分布来干扰推理轨迹。

Result: 抗蒸馏采样成功降低了推理轨迹对蒸馏的有效性，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Conclusion: 抗蒸馏采样是一种有效的方法，可以在不牺牲模型性能的情况下保护模型不被蒸馏。

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
\emph{Antidistillation sampling} provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important
issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the
characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the
paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the
basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the
idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for
switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow
model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example
of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在测试时高延迟和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 引入睡眠时间计算，预计算用户可能提出的查询，优化测试时的计算需求。

Result: 在Stateful GSM-Symbolic和Stateful AIME任务上，减少5倍计算量并提升准确率13%-18%。

Conclusion: 睡眠时间计算能有效降低计算成本并提升模型性能，尤其在查询可预测性高的场景中效果显著。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency
and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to
"think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating
what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can
significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -
Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can
reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~
5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time
compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic
and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,
which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context.
By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context
using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by
2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute
is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well
correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a
case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

Result: 协作模式与输入类型相关且具有语义意义，CAEP算法平均提升性能2.5%。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE LLMs的效率和解释性提供了新见解，优化了专家交互和模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown
significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to
specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among
experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and
optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues:
(1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs
through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical
sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration
patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the
Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes
low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert
collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit
semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show
that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average,
outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into
enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer
understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

Motivation: 解决LoRA在多轮设置中切换时需重新计算KV缓存导致的低效问题。

Method: 提出aLoRA，仅对调用后的令牌调整权重，接受基础模型的KV缓存。

Result: aLoRA在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: aLoRA为高效定制化模型提供了新方法，适用于多轮对话场景。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for
finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to
method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly
customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a
multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the
entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation
can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which
modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the
sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA
to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can
be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the
cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly
specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an
input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We
use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive
accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge
in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each
potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces
complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing
multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose
a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of
the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to
have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby
allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the
objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search
or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its
advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective
optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting
scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are
scarce.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across
industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language
processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its
rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust
and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches
to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable
symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks
(FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the
operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The
derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several
examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic
paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify
symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships.
The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across
network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision
tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision
processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative
refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras
.h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This
prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations
from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting
accountability.

machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran
Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We
generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying
and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors
calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori
eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine
learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and
benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models
that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and
functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true
processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location
coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across
various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these
findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial
autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network
autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran
Eigenvectors would still be useful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中的公平性日益重要，需避免对边缘群体的不利预测。

Result: 算法在理论和实验上均表现良好，适用于二元和子群公平性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且强大，为公平性机器学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical
concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have
disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to
mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such
as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice
concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning
problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a
broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such
as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We
study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max
optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual
problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to
diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting
algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and
empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and
subgroup fairness.

TL;DR: Default MoE方法通过稀疏激活参数但密集梯度更新，解决了MoE训练中的不稳定性和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE) 预训练因稀疏梯度更新导致训练不稳定和性能不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出Default MoE方法，用专家输出的指数移动平均替代缺失的激活，使路由器接收每个专家的信号。

Result: Default MoE在多种设置中优于标准TopK路由，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: Default MoE通过密集梯度更新显著提升了MoE的训练性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer
pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their
feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse
backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We
present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense
gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our
method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert
activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of
expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the
router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to
significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms
standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant
computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Conclusion: 为Transformer解决数学问题提供了严格的几何基础，回应了Lample和Charton的多样化输入训练理念。

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid
progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They
demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving
mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific
datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using
Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based
Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical
guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In
this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed
algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers
can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose
an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of
ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer.
Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address
a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of
training on diverse or representative inputs.

TL;DR: D2FT框架通过动态选择注意力模块，显著降低基础模型微调的计算和通信成本，同时保持较高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型规模增大导致微调在商业设备上内存带宽不足，现有方法计算成本高且负载不均衡。

Method: 提出D2FT框架，基于注意力模块选择策略和多背包优化，减少计算和通信开销。

Result: 实验显示D2FT降低40%计算成本和50%通信成本，准确性仅下降1%-2%。

Conclusion: D2FT高效且可扩展，适用于参数高效的微调技术如LoRA。

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with
minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation
models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model
fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory
bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this
issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory
requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their
foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high
computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations
across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention
modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning
foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT
significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning
foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in
distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via
multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and
training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show
that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost
or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on
Stanford Cars dataset.

learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced
topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation --

Motivation: 工程设计中的机器学习模型常面临计算成本高且数据有限的问题，持续学习能帮助模型在不重新训练的情况下适应新数据。

Method: 在五个工程数据集上应用多种CL方法，构建了九个新的工程CL基准测试，评估其减少遗忘和提升泛化的能力。

Result: 初步结果显示，现有CL方法（如Replay策略）在多个基准测试中表现接近重新训练，同时训练时间减少近半。

Conclusion: 持续学习在工程设计中具有实际应用潜力，Replay策略尤其适合现实工程工作流。

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve
computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering
data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new
knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models
from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work
introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on
representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering
datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their
ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results
show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over
naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance
comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by
nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

TL;DR: MOM是一种高效的内存优化方法，通过将关键层分割为“迷你序列”并结合KV缓存卸载，显著减少GPU内存使用，同时保持模型性能和输出一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文语言模型在推理时GPU内存需求高，部署困难。

Method: 将关键层分割为“迷你序列”，结合KV缓存卸载技术。

Result: MOM平均减少50%以上的峰值内存使用，并在单GPU上显著扩展最大上下文长度，同时保持输出一致性和准确性。

Conclusion: MOM解决了推理中的内存瓶颈，改变了研究重点，未来可专注于解码阶段的KV缓存效率优化。

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain
challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We
propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that
partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates
seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and
Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on
average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k
to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and
not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due
to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared
to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context
length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill
memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory
bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research
priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to
improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型的泛化能力与其训练目标（DSM）的噪声特性相关，但具体机制不明。

Method: 利用物理学启发的路径积分方法，分析欠参数化和过参数化扩散模型的学习分布。

Result: 扩散模型学习到的分布类似训练分布但填补了‘空白’，这种归纳偏置源于训练目标的协方差结构。

Conclusion: 噪声目标的协方差结构是扩散模型泛化的关键因素，并与特征相关的归纳偏置相互作用。

Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and
is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score
matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score
function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn
the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy.
We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its
target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only
equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent
diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory
that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our
theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to
compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and
overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion
models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions,
but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the
covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also
characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive
biases.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效满足未知安全定义，并可扩展到各种连续控制任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习安全模型，实现了在未知安全约束下的安全强化学习，具有有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align
the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including
cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires
anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general
setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from
sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety
model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact
on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their
corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory
is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to
demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.
Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and
derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally,
our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is
effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various
continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为国家预报机构提供了一种利用本地数据优化全球模型的途径，降低了机器学习水文预测系统的部署门槛。

Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood
forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown
that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood
predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This
requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national
forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their
region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore,
traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local
data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable
for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a
methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then
fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in
performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra
information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that
performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform
during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish
to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the
barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习限制了Hopfield网络的容量，而现有的核方法（如KLR）虽然性能提升但依赖迭代学习，因此需要一种更高效的非迭代学习方法。

Method: 采用核岭回归（KRR）作为替代方案，通过闭式解非迭代地学习对偶变量。

Result: KRR在存储容量（达到1.5的比例）和噪声鲁棒性（从约80%的损坏模式中恢复）上与KLR相当，同时大幅缩短训练时间。

Conclusion: KRR是一种高效的高性能联想记忆构建方法，兼具性能和速度优势。

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network capacity. While kernel methods like
Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) improve performance via iterative learning, we

learning speed advantages. We show KRR achieves comparably high storage

Result: 在Atari Pong和Breakout基准测试中，EPO在策略质量和样本效率上均优于标准PG和EC方法。

Conclusion: EPO有效解决了强化学习中探索与利用的权衡问题，适用于需要全局探索和局部优化的任务。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency.
Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained,
gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their
focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel
in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a
hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods
for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and
the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the
exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and
Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy
quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it
effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

Result: 在多个数据集上，MagMatch在分类准确率和OOD检测AUROC上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MagMatch通过自然隔离OOD样本和动态对齐策略，有效提升了开放集半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of
learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and
unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form
suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with
them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we
introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples
through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional
methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it
selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective
Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain
unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective
Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts
alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both
closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in
generalizing to unseen OOD data.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FedDua在客户端数据量声明不准确的情况下，平均提升全局模型性能3.17%。

Conclusion: FedDua有效解决了联邦学习中因数据量不准确导致的模型偏差问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning
models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client
privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the
performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation
method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client,
which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is
prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data
volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we
propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata
q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It
enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each
client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be
seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model
aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17%
compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate
client data volume declarations.

Conclusion: ChemKANs在燃烧物理和化学动力学中潜力显著，展示了KAN-ODEs在复杂问题中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion
problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time
scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these
models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy
data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations
(KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications
thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth
activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE
framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the
relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation
loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables
streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating
parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and
outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no
overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models
from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet
struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN
(only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry,
providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is
generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations
indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics,
and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and
more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

Conclusion: 通过多任务、公平感知学习，可以减轻决策树模型中的算法偏见。

Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while
satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically
optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result
in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g.,
gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a
tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by
optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for
increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART
achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance
degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering

*Liheng Ma,Soumyasundar Pal,Yingxue Zhang,Philip H. S. Torr,Mark Coates*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种简单修改，使普通Transformer适用于图学习，无需复杂架构调整，并在多个图数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer架构复杂，难以利用Transformer的训练进展，因此需要简化方法。

Method: 提出三种修改：(1) 简化的L2注意力；(2) 自适应均方根归一化；(3) 共享编码器的相对位置编码偏置。

Result: 在多种图数据集上取得显著性能提升，并在图同构表达性测试中表现突出。

Conclusion: 简单修改即可使Transformer适用于图学习，且效果显著。

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities,
employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph
Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either
integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention
mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer
training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain
Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major
architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1)
simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2)
adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude
information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder.
Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the
effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation
on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in
the graph isomorphism.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大后验概率（MAP）的框架BetaConform，用于高效且精确地估计LLM集成判断的性能，结合Beta-Binomial分布、自适应停止和先验迁移机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM集成判断的准确性估计缺乏高效方法，尤其是在标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 使用Beta-Binomial分布建模判断分布，引入自适应停止策略和先验迁移机制，提出BetaConform框架。

Result: 在TruthfulQA数据集上，仅需10个样本即可将误差控制在3.37%以内。

Conclusion: BetaConform为LLM集成判断的性能估计提供了高效且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their
accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present
a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise
estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a
mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution,
revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal
prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative
sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior
transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets
to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are
available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our
distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to
deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble
judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated
empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset,
for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error
margin as small as 3.37%.

*Bijan Mazaheri,Jiaqi Zhang,Caroline Uhler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了约束型因果发现算法中条件独立性检验的‘元依赖性’，提出了一种基于信息投影的简单计算方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束型因果发现算法依赖于因果马尔可夫条件和忠实性假设，但在有限数据下，这些假设可能因条件独立性的多重违反而失效，因此需要研究条件独立性之间的‘元依赖性’。

Method: 通过几何直觉，将每个条件独立性约束视为联合分布空间中的一个流形，利用信息投影计算这些流形之间的‘元依赖性’。

Result: 提出了一种简单可计算的‘元依赖性’度量方法，并通过合成和真实数据验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解条件独立性之间的关系提供了新视角，有助于改进因果发现算法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests
for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These
approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the
graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence
properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and
faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to
the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions,
the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different
conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time.
We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties
using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property
constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The
"meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position
of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a
simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections
and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world
data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中使用的步长方案多样，但现有收敛分析有限且依赖强假设，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入停止时间方法，分析SGD在更宽松步长条件和较弱假设下的收敛性。

Result: 在非凸设置下，证明了SGD的几乎必然收敛和L2收敛，放宽了损失函数的全局Lipschitz连续性和随机梯度高阶矩的有界性要求。

Conclusion: 本文的理论结果更具普适性，增强了在实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning
research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size
setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a
wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing
convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This
paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a
stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under
more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex
setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $
\{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t =
+\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$.
Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz
continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness
requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon
the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence.
These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more
general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control
gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental
cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput
sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN
inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial

supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze
large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support
both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the
development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive
review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the
datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on
the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing
inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN
inference are also discussed.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过不确定性量化（UQ）技术提升图神经网络（GNN）在材料建模中的可靠性，提出了一种轻量级方法DPOSE，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在材料发现中表现优异，但对域外数据预测不可靠且难以识别，需改进其不确定性量化能力。

Method: 提出DPOSE方法，将其集成到SchNet模型中，评估其在QM9、OC20和Gold Molecular Dynamics等数据集上的表现。

Result: DPOSE能有效区分域内和域外数据，对未观测到的分子和材料类别表现出更高的不确定性。

Conclusion: 轻量级UQ方法（如DPOSE）可提升GNN的鲁棒性，并为未来与主动学习策略结合奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AV）的感知模块依赖深度学习模型，对抗攻击可能导致严重错误分类，因此需要更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 使用AlexNet和VGG-16作为特征提取器，结合1000多个量子电路构建HCQ-DL模型，测试其对PGD、FGSA和GA三种对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: HCQ-DL在无攻击场景下准确率超过95%，在FGSA和GA攻击下超过91%，优于C-DL模型；PGD攻击下，HCQ-DL准确率为85%，而C-DL低于21%。

Conclusion: HCQ-DL模型在对抗攻击下显著提升了交通标志分类的准确性，优于经典模型。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for
autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might
have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks
that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly
classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In
this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning
(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate
robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding
them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and
vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our
HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack
(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted
adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during
adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain
accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA
attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our
alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL
models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the
HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under
adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于PU学习中聚类假设的特征选择方法FSCPU，解决了传统方法将未标记数据视为负样本导致的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在PU学习任务中，传统特征选择方法可能无法捕捉正样本的统计特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: FSCPU将特征选择问题建模为二元优化任务，目标函数明确结合了PU学习中的聚类假设。

Result: 实验表明FSCPU在多种数据条件下有效，且在三个公开数据集上与10种传统算法相比表现优异。

Conclusion: FSCPU在PU学习中具有竞争力，即使聚类假设不完全成立时仍表现良好。

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes
encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few
positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain
real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection
often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature
selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the
statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to
suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection
method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU
formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an
objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in
the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons
with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves
competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the
cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Conclusion: VLMGuard-R1为视觉语言模型的安全对齐提供了一种有效且无需修改模型核心参数的新方向。

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to
mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating
vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional
safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to
preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM
safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce
VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a
reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to
deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures
without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a
three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter
to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic
refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal
that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1
achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on
the SIUO benchmark.

Motivation: 驾驶员对风险的感知影响其对自动驾驶系统（ADS）的接受、信任和使用，但现有方法难以评估主观感知风险。

Method: 采用驾驶员在环实验，结合CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络和半监督学习策略，预测驾驶员实时主观风险评分（SRRs）。

Result: DSPR模型的预测准确率最高（87.91%），半监督策略提升准确率20.12%，CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络在四种LSTM结构中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估驾驶员感知风险提供了有效方法，有助于提升自动驾驶系统安全性和驾驶员信任度。

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of
the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and
difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's
subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as
a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20
participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their
real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic
driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long
short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is
embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to
reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results
illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in
predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The
semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA
network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures.
This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk,
providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust
improvement.

Motivation: 传统PINN框架依赖完整的时间序列数据，而许多系统难以获取此类数据，因此需要一种能处理非时间序列或部分观测数据的方法。

Method: 开发了约束学习范式及其数学框架，并提出了MPOCtrL优化方法，平衡物理模型与观测数据的拟合。

Conclusion: 约束学习及MPOCtrL为处理数据稀缺或高维问题提供了新思路，尤其在复杂系统建模中表现优异。

Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by
integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural
network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges
with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN
frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which
could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN
learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation
of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially
observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation
of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message
Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach
tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the
fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github
link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear
dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the
system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL
outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Motivation: 探讨在多任务持续学习中，梯度下降训练的分类器是否会收敛到联合最大间隔解，以及任务顺序和任务间关系对遗忘和知识转移的影响。

Method: 在多任务线性分类问题中，依次对每个任务运行固定次数的梯度下降，分析任务顺序（循环或随机）对结果的影响。

Result: 当任务联合线性可分时，分类器收敛到联合最大间隔解；任务顺序和任务间对齐程度影响遗忘和知识转移；非联合可分时，模型收敛到联合损失函数的最小值。

Conclusion: 梯度下降在多任务持续学习中可以收敛到联合最优解，任务顺序和任务间关系对遗忘和知识转移有重要影响。

Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by
sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per
task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a
cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear
classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising
because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the
individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint
max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions.
Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a
non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1)
alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and
backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero
as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer
jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges
to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently.
However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and
inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The
Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder
extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to
graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical
analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders,
demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture
graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with
vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and
codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based
encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of
training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training
progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer
codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The
second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn
closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in
the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in
self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple
datasets.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)
often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like
linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In
this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key
techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are
frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these
ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce
TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information
compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified
framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating
temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to
capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We
propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain,
supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the
learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule
can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标签特征选择方法主要关注全局特征，忽略了标签的个性化需求，影响了性能。

Result: 实验表明GPMFS在多个真实数据集上表现优异，同时保持强解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GPMFS证明了个性化特征选择方法的必要性和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task
scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent
research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the
major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be
effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,
existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying
global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized
characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This
global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific
discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and
Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly
identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively
supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features
using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining
strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights
into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby

Motivation: 传统联邦学习依赖中心化架构，且目标函数常为非凸复合优化问题，现有方法对此研究不足，因此需要一种高效的去中心化解决方案。

Method: 基于近端随机梯度跟踪，引入动量优化和局部更新，减少数据异质性和通信开销。

Conclusion: DEPOSITUM是一种高效的去中心化非凸复合联邦学习算法，适用于实际场景，并具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the
server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning,
attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the
objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and
frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms
to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite
optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization
problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite
Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon
proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data
heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The
introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing
tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients.
Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables,
significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an
iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient,
consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate
of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm
achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch
sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on
real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various
hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite
optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Method: 提出Sign-In方法，动态重参数化以诱导符号翻转，补充密集到稀疏训练的不足。

Result: 实验和理论表明Sign-In能提升PaI性能，但未完全弥合性能差距。

Conclusion: Sign-In是解决PaI性能问题的有效方法，但完全弥合差距仍是未来挑战。

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch
(PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient
deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on
finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end,
determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to
PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic
reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are
complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish,
rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory
suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open
challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

enhances interpretability of PSO's decisions and provides practical guidelines
for choosing suitable topologies for specific optimization tasks. Ultimately,
this contributes to making swarm based optimization more transparent, robust,

Conclusion: 该方案为从VQNNs梯度中恢复数据提供了有效方法，尤其在模型过参数化时表现优异。

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is
characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits.
Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model
gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this
paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input
training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our
scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients
estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering.
The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient
convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even
batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT)
and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing
profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data
using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index.
We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and
sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due
to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our
strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs
hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to
manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has
the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than
the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and
tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12
days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation
decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where
as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period
and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period.
All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss
of 2.2508 %.

Conclusion: FedX通过结合模型量化和知识共享，在保证收敛性的同时，实现了高效且低开销的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices
without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking.
However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low
computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained
mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes
FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.
To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a
global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized
bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources
receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number
of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization
operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on
devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and
in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization
term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model
quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a
cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX
significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation
time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with
baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically
and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's
optimization efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡问题在机器学习中普遍存在，尤其是大数据场景下，SMOTE方法在生成新样本时容易受到噪声和异常值的影响，导致分类器性能下降。

Method: iHHO-SMOTe方法首先通过随机森林进行特征选择，再利用DBSCAN算法检测并移除异常值，最后使用改进的SMOTE进行过采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，iHHO-SMOTe在AUC、G-means和F1-score等指标上表现优异，AUC超过0.99，G-means为0.99，F1-score稳定高于0.967。

Conclusion: iHHO-SMOTe通过噪声和异常值处理显著提升了分类性能，成为解决类别不平衡问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine
learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed
among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier
performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses
this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority
class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation
of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses
the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This
process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify
the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers
based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority
classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent
oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive
experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of
the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of
0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently
exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a
formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise
reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示FL在非IID数据下的潜在安全风险，并提出一种更隐蔽且高效的后门攻击方法。

Method: 提出CollaPois攻击，通过分发预训练的特洛伊模型给被攻陷客户端，协作生成恶意梯度，使FL模型向特洛伊模型收敛。

Result: CollaPois在多种基准数据集上表现优于现有攻击，能规避防御机制，且在少数被攻陷客户端下仍有效。

Conclusion: 非IID数据加剧了FL的安全风险，CollaPois展示了其隐蔽性和高效性，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using
decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness
against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new
vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed
(non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of
model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative
backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a
single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised
clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients,
causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region
centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the
Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data
distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving
its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting
it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable
shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples,
allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL
algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses,
especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions.
Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving
a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is
closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor
infections.

Conclusion: Bird-MAE在鸟类声音分类任务中表现出色，原型探测方法缩小了与微调的性能差距。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the
fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as
bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing
environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its
unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a
domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We
explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen
representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet
downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification
performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally,
we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging
MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear
probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately
3\% on average on BirdSet.

Result: 通过实验验证了动态关闭权重衰减可以改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式正则化对隐式偏差有持久影响，动态调整正则化策略（如权重衰减）可以提升模型表现。

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized
models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often
employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been
studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their
interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it
can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate
explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting
effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct
effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical
approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix
sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility
of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight
the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch
off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we
demonstrate in experiments.

Conclusion: 为ICL提供了精确的动态模型，并为分析复杂Transformer训练提供了理论工具。

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to
novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical
characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing
regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation
of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure,
leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops,
including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation
laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning
behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology
extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired
macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them
to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in
attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular
arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and
theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to
automate the labeling of ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) items. While the ARAT
is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include
subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial

technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor
recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage
included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to
improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants
performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and
reliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in
distinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve
improving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data

adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require
multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational
inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient
computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement
learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training
with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling
as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal
training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we
replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient
function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative
calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize
long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments
across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear,
high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs
significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in
accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead,
making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the
exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural
innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to
effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for
improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free
grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy
metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM
have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Conclusion: 提出的VM为低精度计算提供了灵活高效的解决方案，显著提升了GPU程序的性能，适用于LLM等资源密集型应用。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications
but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory
bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged
as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption.
Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight
bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to
high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical
optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory
access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations.
In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose
GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with
arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM
features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a
novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision
data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with
automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision
data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their
supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well
as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves
performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Top-$k$和Top-$k(x)$的Learning-to-Defer框架，通过将查询分配给多个最自信的代理，提升决策系统的可靠性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单代理延迟决策方法在高风险场景中不足，需要利用集体专业知识。

Method: 提出了Top-$k$和Top-$k(x)$的延迟学习框架，前者固定分配k个代理，后者动态调整代理数量。

Result: 实验证明该框架在分类和回归任务中有效，且理论证明了其收敛到贝叶斯最优分配。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了决策可靠性，还扩展了模型级联范式。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve
reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent
agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent
deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require
collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of
the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most
confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and
cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive
extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query,
based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation
costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is
Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring
convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the
well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our
Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both
classification and regression tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT prompting improves ICL in LLMs but lacks understanding of generalization under distribution shift. This study extends a latent-variable framework to test CoT on OOD scenarios, showing performance depends on latent variable similarity to training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how CoT prompting generalizes under distribution shift, specifically in OOD scenarios.

Method: Extends a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and tests it on two OOD scenarios: permuted latent variables and uniformly scaled latent variables.

Result: CoT generalizes well when OOD samples' latent variables resemble training data, but performance declines as similarity decreases.

Conclusion: The study highlights CoT's strengths and limitations under OOD conditions, guiding future development of more resilient reasoning strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to
improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking
complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to
generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we
extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on
two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables
for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent
variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT
inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely
resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this
similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the
strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest
directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

Conclusion: IFGC通过压缩图显著加速GNN推理，同时保证推理质量，适用于大规模图分析。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph
analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering
their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly
graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs
inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed
graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that
the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little
decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference
equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not
distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical
specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving
compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN
inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a
configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and
anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of
interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms
with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct
extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the
effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

Conclusion: APM为多链蛋白质建模提供了高效工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or
biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on
single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with
advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these
developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely
uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions.
Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom
Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling
multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data
on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain
interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from
scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain
proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it
achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also
supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

Motivation: 研究自监督学习（SSL）中表示收敛的普拉提理想现象，并填补理论与实际成功之间的差距。

Method: 通过综合可识别性理论（IT）的证据，提出扩展的奇异可识别性理论（SITh），以解释SSL的成功。

Result: SITh为SSL提供了一个更广泛的理论框架，有助于理解其隐含的数据假设。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注SSL的训练动态、有限样本的影响以及归纳偏置的作用，以推动更可解释和泛化的表示学习。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising
capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their
out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to
ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral
Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that
uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors
derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory
prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic
spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels,
which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as
stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation
framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the
nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,
demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In
particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where
uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:

Conclusion: Hadamard积是一种高效且多功能的深度学习原语，为未来架构创新提供了基础。

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural
design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied
primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across
various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed
as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy
of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains:
higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation
modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability
to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it
particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing
scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks,
such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation
masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This
systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard
product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation
for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product
as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between
computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a
crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication

Conclusion: TAL为无抗寒性数据的作物提供了可行的预测方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending
on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy
season. This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models,
which help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures.
Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for
some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.
Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of
budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we
introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels
(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more
accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is
available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks
(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and
auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is
assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict
primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.
Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our
knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we
propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that
can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our
results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape
cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve
cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real
improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we
propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.
MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal
pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit
localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and
connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,
attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable
localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate
model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find
that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit
localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS
method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,
standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB
enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that
there has been real progress in the field.

Conclusion: Miras为深度学习架构设计提供了灵活且高效的框架，展示了注意力偏见目标在模型性能中的重要性。

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the
core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models.
Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural
tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural
architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent
neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and
values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias.
Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either
(1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their
attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of
alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective
approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret
forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of
retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence
models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to
design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative
memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and
(iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta,
Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while
maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show
different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For
example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special
tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive
tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent
models.

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法将完全约束草图的百分比从8.9%提升至93%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何现有约束生成模型，并为语言与设计领域的对齐策略研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating
engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models.
Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines)
connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the
relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints
must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates
predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate
CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design
intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards
aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain
all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch
geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation
model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain
93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to
any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further
research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

*Ruijie Wang,Luca Rossetto,Susan Mérillat,Christina Röcke,Mike Martin,Abraham Bernstein*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法CSegSynth，利用易获取的人口统计和认知测试信息生成个体特异性脑MRI分割，优于现有生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要详细脑结构信息，难以获取且昂贵，因此需要一种更便捷的替代方案。

Method: 使用深度学习模型CSegSynth，基于人口统计、访谈和认知测试数据生成3D脑MRI分割。

Result: CSegSynth在生成质量上优于C-VAE、C-GAN和C-LDM，体积预测的Pearson相关系数高达0.80、0.82和0.70。

Conclusion: CSegSynth为个体特异性脑MRI分割提供了一种高效且低成本的方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate
synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific
individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the
individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive,
and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable
of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white
matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations --
for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available
demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a
novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent
generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE),
conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent
diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic
segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the
effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume
prediction, with Pearson correlation coefficients reaching 0.80, 0.82, and 0.70
between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those
volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在随机梯度下降（SGD）中，由于采样噪声，传统方法无法达到最优收敛速率。本文旨在探索一种新方法，以在SGD中实现接近最优的收敛性能。

Method: 通过将广义SGD算法与复平面中的轮廓关联，并利用具有特定外部角的轮廓加速收敛，同时优化噪声与加速的平衡。

Result: 证明了最优收敛速率可通过调整外部角参数实现，并展示了有限内存算法对理想算法的有效近似。

Conclusion: 广义SGD结合无限记忆和优化参数，能够在SGD中实现接近最优的收敛速率，并通过实验验证了其实际效果。

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems
with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems
deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be
improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary
Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules).
However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the
Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In
this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a
generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying
generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show
that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the
plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD,
increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to
$O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies
the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing
the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by
$\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the
exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions.
Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show
that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory
algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem
and MNIST.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种关于符合松弛超鞅条件的随机过程渐进行为的新结果，提供了收敛速度的显式构造，并应用于多个经典随机近似理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机过程的渐进行为，特别是松弛超鞅条件下的收敛速度，以填补现有理论在定量分析上的不足。

Method: 通过构造显式且有效的收敛速度，结合松弛超鞅条件，推导出定量结果，并应用于随机近似理论中的经典问题。

Result: 得到了随机过程在均值和几乎必然意义下的收敛速度，并验证了其在Robbins-Monro过程中的适用性。

Conclusion: 论文的方法具有广泛适用性，可推广到多种随机近似问题，并能构造快速（如线性）收敛速度。

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic
processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our
result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and
effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean
and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only
depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration.
We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known
concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing
effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's
convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er
monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly
general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro
procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their
applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of
potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other
well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range
of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied.
Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even
allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）生成代码中的重复问题，提出了DeRep技术以减少重复并提升代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在显著的重复问题，影响效率和可读性，需系统研究和解决方案。

Method: 通过定量和定性分析19种先进代码LLM，总结20种重复模式，并提出规则化技术DeRep。

Result: DeRep显著减少重复（平均提升91.3%-93.5%）并提高代码质量（Pass@1提升208.3%）。

Conclusion: DeRep有效解决代码重复问题，并可提升现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
the quality of LLM-generated code still faces significant challenges. One
significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to
generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced
readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to
investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art
code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive
and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character,
statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition
patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique
designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep
using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results
demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing
repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3,
rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1
increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves
the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1
improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于海德格尔基础本体论的新型IT分析系统，通过区分存在者（das Seiende）与存在（das Sein），使用两种模态不同的语言处理用户输入和内部分析，并通过现象学还原模块连接两者，以揭示更深层次的本体模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代系统局限于范畴分析，无法处理复杂的本体问题，如隐喻使用或逻辑陷阱。本文旨在通过海德格尔的现象学存在分析，提供更深入的查询处理工具。

Method: 系统采用两种语言：存在者的范畴语言和存在的存在语言，通过现象学还原模块连接，分析用户查询并识别递归和自指结构。

Result: 系统能够揭示更深层次的本体模式，帮助解决复杂交互中的逻辑陷阱，并通过实际案例展示了其优势。

Conclusion: 该系统的实现为通用查询分析工具奠定了基础，但仍需进一步形式化存在语言以完善计算性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use
cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative
evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语言的开放银行交易分类系统，专注于法语市场和法语文本，通过领域特定技术提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSD2法规引入开放银行框架，为银行和金融科技公司提供了利用交易描述理解客户行为的机会，但领域特定文本的自然语言处理应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 系统包括数据收集、标注、预处理、建模和评估阶段，结合语言特定技术和领域知识。

Result: 相比通用方法，该系统在法语银行数据分类中表现出更高的性能和效率。

Conclusion: 该系统为银行领域特定文本的自然语言处理提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the
Open Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and
fintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of
building a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this
understanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and
tailored services.
  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques
has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the
past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain
unaddressed especially in the banking sector.
  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction
classification system with a focus on the french market and french language
text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,
modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general
classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the
challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus
(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific
techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced
performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在信息检索任务中自动化相关性判断的应用增多，其与人类标注的一致性接近人类间一致性，但提示敏感性对结果的影响尚不明确。

Method: 研究收集了15位人类专家和15个LLMs生成的提示，覆盖三种任务类型（二元、分级和成对），共90个提示。筛选后使用72个提示，结合三个LLMs对TREC数据集进行标注，并与官方人类标注进行对比。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM在信息检索任务中的评估提供了数据支持，并公开了所有数据和提示以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate relevance
judgments for information retrieval (IR) tasks, often demonstrating agreement
with human labels that approaches inter-human agreement. To assess the
robustness and reliability of LLM-based relevance judgments, we systematically
investigate impact of prompt sensitivity on the task. We collected prompts for
relevance assessment from 15 human experts and 15 LLMs across three tasks~ --
~binary, graded, and pairwise~ -- ~yielding 90 prompts in total. After
filtering out unusable prompts from three humans and three LLMs, we employed
the remaining 72 prompts with three different LLMs as judges to label
document/query pairs from two TREC Deep Learning Datasets (2020 and 2021). We
compare LLM-generated labels with TREC official human labels using Cohen's
$\kappa$ and pairwise agreement measures. In addition to investigating the
impact of prompt variations on agreement with human labels, we compare human-
and LLM-generated prompts and analyze differences among different LLMs as
judges. We also compare human- and LLM-generated prompts with the standard
UMBRELA prompt used for relevance assessment by Bing and TREC 2024 Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. To support future research in LLM-based
evaluation, we release all data and prompts at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实用户数据的稀缺性和隐私问题，需要一种可信且成本效益高的方法来模拟用户行为。

Method: SimUSER通过识别历史数据中的自洽角色，并配备角色、记忆、感知和大脑模块，模拟用户与推荐系统的交互。

Result: SimUSER在微观和宏观层面均比先前工作更接近真实用户行为，并通过实验探索了缩略图、曝光效应和评论对用户参与的影响。

Conclusion: 基于离线A/B测试结果优化推荐系统参数，显著提升了真实世界中的用户参与度。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications,
yet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap
between offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits
(e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent
framework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER
first identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user
profiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this
evaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain
modules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits
closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro
levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects
of thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on
user engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on
offline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real
world.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both academic and
industry settings to automate the evaluation of information seeking systems,
particularly by generating graded relevance judgments. Previous work on
LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded
human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there
has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive
comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple
LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments,
graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two
nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In
addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall
correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human
preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive
experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and
2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain
question answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments
generated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.
Our goal is to \textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods
to provide a comprehensive comparison. All code, data, and resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColBERT等神经IR模型需要大量内存存储文档令牌的上下文表示，现有剪枝方法无法保证不影响检索分数。

Method: 引入三种正则化损失和两种剪枝策略，以高剪枝率剪枝令牌。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用30%的令牌即可保持ColBERT的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持检索效果的同时显著减少了内存需求。

Abstract: Late interaction neural IR models like ColBERT offer a competitive
effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. However, they
require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the
document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or
statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however
doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval
score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens
without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three
regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well
as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain),
showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\% of the
tokens.

Motivation: 构建现实、可扩展且无污染的IR和RAG评估基准，以推动信息检索技术的发展。

Method: FreshStack通过三步构建数据集：(1)自动从代码和技术文档收集语料，(2)从社区问答生成片段，(3)结合混合检索技术检索文档。

Result: 在五个快速发展的主题上，现有检索模型表现显著低于理想方法，且部分情况下重排序未提升检索精度。

Conclusion: FreshStack为构建高质量IR评估基准提供了工具，展示了现有技术的不足，并鼓励未来研究改进IR质量。

Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a reusable framework for automatically building
information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks from community-asked questions
and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus
collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from
community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving
documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We
use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics
to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing
retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform
oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR
quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve
first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics). We hope that
FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable,
and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks. FreshStack datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态检索方法依赖嵌入相似性计算，而生成式检索虽具潜力，但在标识符构建和生成过程中语义信息不足。

Method: 提出SemCORE框架，包括结构化自然语言标识符（SID）和生成语义验证（GSV）策略，同时支持文本到图像和图像到文本的双向检索。

Result: 实验表明，SemCORE在基准数据集上表现优异，文本到图像检索的Recall@1平均提升8.65分。

Conclusion: SemCORE通过增强语义理解能力，显著提升了生成式跨模态检索的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research,
focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different
modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via
embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained
generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising
alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and
leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to
input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current
generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both
identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval
framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding
capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first
construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively
aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language
comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic
Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination.
Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to
simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks
within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval
methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark
datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image

TL;DR: 储层计算通过调整全局参数在随机神经网络中引发吸引子合并危机，揭示了其相空间结构的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究储层计算中吸引子合并现象的机制及其普适性。

Method: 通过调整全局参数，分析相空间结构，揭示吸引子合并危机的机制。

Result: 发现吸引子合并危机伴随间歇性现象，且该现象在RNNs中具有普适性。

Conclusion: 吸引子合并危机是RNNs的固有特性，与训练数据无关。

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs),
generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent
symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging
crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global
parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed
analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation
scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

*Nairouz Mrabah,Nicolas Richet,Ismail Ben Ayed,Éric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏优化（SO）框架，通过动态调整少量参数解决视觉语言模型（VLM）在小样本领域适应中的过拟合和计算限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLM在小样本领域适应中的过拟合和计算限制问题，现有低秩重参数化方法泛化能力不足且需大量调参。

Method: 提出SO框架，采用局部稀疏全局密度和局部随机全局重要性两种范式，动态调整少量参数。

Result: 在11个数据集上实验表明，SO在小样本适应中表现最优，同时降低内存开销。

Conclusion: SO框架显著缓解过拟合，提升小样本适应性能，具有高效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled
samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and
computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank
reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with
generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a
novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank
approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method
leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce
two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global
density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while
maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for
\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient
using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This
combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation
in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO
achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory
overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaVid是一个灵活的视频编码框架，通过动态调整计算资源适应不同需求，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编码器计算需求高且仅能处理短片段，难以在边缘设备部署。

Method: 采用自适应Transformer块和轻量级分层网络，动态调整隐藏维度并聚合短片段特征。

Result: AdaVid-EgoVLP在计算资源减半时性能与EgoVLP相当，资源相同时表现更优；支持更多帧数且不超限。

Conclusion: AdaVid在计算效率和长视频处理上取得平衡，为边缘设备部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in
learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video
encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their
high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained
to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this
paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to
learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational
footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive
transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows
the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show
that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D
dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language
benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given
equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame
count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing
that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational
limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical
network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between
compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的新型导航系统，用于辅助超声检查中的心脏下腔静脉（IVC）定位，适用于不同质量的超声设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心脏超声检查需要专业人员和高质量设备，限制了其在医院外的应用。AI导航系统可帮助新手操作者获取标准化视图。

Method: 系统采用离线训练的决策模型和二元分类方法识别IVC，并结合新型定位算法实时标注IVC空间位置。

Result: 模型在高质量和低成本超声视频中均表现优异，支持医院外诊断。

Conclusion: 该系统已在临床试用中，有望扩展超声诊断的应用范围。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose
cardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert
sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally
only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and
algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the
standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease
pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to
predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates
a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying
the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained
offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to
determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The
underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the
learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in
real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on
traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive
zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable
Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the
expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the
guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly
iQ app.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术室优化需识别工作流瓶颈，但计算机视觉方法涉及隐私问题，需隐私保护方案。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）利用视觉基础模型生成去标识化的数字孪生；2）使用SafeOR模型（双流融合）处理分割掩码和深度图进行事件检测。

Result: 在38次模拟手术试验中，数字孪生方法的事件检测性能接近或优于原始RGB视频模型。

Conclusion: 数字孪生支持隐私保护的手术室工作流分析，促进跨机构数据共享，并可能通过减少外观差异提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing
workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of
computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative
events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,
privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection
from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR
workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,
we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic
segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from
conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a
fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for
OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38
simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results
indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves
performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on
detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow
analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions
and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating
domain-specific appearance differences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件数据预训练方法未能与RGB帧建立强关联，限制了其在多模态融合场景中的应用。

Method: 设计了多模态融合重建模块和对比学习策略，输入包括RGB图像、事件图像和事件体素。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的实验证明了CM3AE的有效性。

Conclusion: CM3AE框架为基于事件和RGB-Event融合的下游任务提供了强大支持。

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power
consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring
pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to
establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in
multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE
pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts
multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images,
and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event
fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion
reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused
multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate
cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a
shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for
multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a
large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the
pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated
the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released
on https://github.com/Event-AHU/CM3AE.

Motivation: 现有SGG方法在受损图像上性能下降，因视觉特征受干扰或遮挡。布局信息是领域不变的，可用于增强鲁棒性。

Method: 利用实例归一化过滤领域特定特征，通过布局导向恢复恢复结构特征，并设计布局嵌入编码器增强对象和谓词特征。

Conclusion: Robo-SGG作为即插即用模块，显著提升SGG在受损图像上的性能，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,
Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph
Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph
generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,
with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted
images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to
compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To
obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is
domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted
images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the
domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,
the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed
Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder
(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG
framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and
predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a
plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the
state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative
improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet
tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art
performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We
will release our source code and model.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在处理地球观测数据时忽视了地理空间元数据的重要性，限制了其在大规模应用中的表现。

Method: 提出BRIDGE-LC框架，结合细粒度和粗粒度空间信息，通过多层感知机架构学习区域特定和区域无关特征。

Result: 实验表明，整合地理空间信息显著提升了土地覆盖分类性能，尤其是在联合利用细粒度和粗粒度信息时效果最佳。

Conclusion: BRIDGE-LC通过有效利用地理空间信息，为大规模土地覆盖制图提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a
critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced
machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery
data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could
enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global
scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level
Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel
deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into
the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging
fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)
spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns
from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for
inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land
cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the
quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt
several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale
land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an
extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all
biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region
is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned
by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the
geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that
integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,
with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and
coarse-grained spatial information.

Motivation: 解决CLIP模型中图像和文本特征空间之间的模态间隙问题，避免现有方法的高训练成本或零样本性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-Refine有效缩小模态间隙，提升分类和检索任务的零样本性能。

Conclusion: CLIP-Refine是一种高效的后预训练方法，能在不牺牲零样本性能的情况下改善特征对齐。

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of
building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates
remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature
spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text
feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing
works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or
fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or
degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a
post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and
fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training
on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To
this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and
hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features
to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random
reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid
soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and
outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both
maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.
Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show
that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the
zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: 主动学习能有效减少标注成本，同时保持模型性能，为医疗领域的深度学习应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered
related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in
surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning
allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset
construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will
identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same
time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the
newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We
assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep
features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our
experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the
DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over
Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374
mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Conclusion: ANT提供了一种高效、精确的概念擦除方法，为文本到图像模型的伦理部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective
techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While
concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based
approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting
sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods
rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these
shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which
Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is
built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free
guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content
modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This
inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the
early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image
manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For
single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map
to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly
contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient
erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile
plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both
single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without
compromising the generative fidelity. Code is available at

Abstract: Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis.
However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular

The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance
metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice
coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed
U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a
segmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based
image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural
preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We
introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion
model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or
curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and
alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve
precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while
maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture
fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling
detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This
approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring
only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental
results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex
scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of
our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of
simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their
utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否具备组合创造力，提出了IEI框架评估其创造力，并通过实验验证了该框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否能够像人类一样通过组合现有概念产生新颖创意，而非仅依赖训练数据的模式匹配。

Method: 提出IEI框架（识别-解释-隐含），分解创意过程为三个层次，并构建CreativeMashup数据集进行验证。

Result: 在理解任务中，VLMs表现优于普通人类但不及专家；在生成任务中，IEI框架显著提升了VLMs的创意质量。

Conclusion: 研究为评估人工智能创造力提供了理论基础，并为提升VLMs的创意生成提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a
fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their
outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as
synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated
pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,
we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept
blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)
framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying
input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic
implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a
high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according
to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in
comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while
falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating
our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the
creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical
foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for
improving creative generation in VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种算法，将多义性通道解耦为多个单概念通道，提升CNN的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN中多义性通道难以解释的问题。

Method: 通过分析前一层的不同激活模式，重构CNN权重，解耦多义性特征。

Result: 成功解耦多义性通道，提升特征可视化等解释技术的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了CNN的可解释性。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual
components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger
circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging
since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct
concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an
algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple
channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures
weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel
exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling
these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs,
ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于领域差距，图像特征空间难以找到可靠的共同特征，而语言具有更全面的表达元素。

Method: 利用语言空间捕获类别关系的语义表示，视觉空间探索同类样本的共同模式，并通过多模态空间对齐语言和视觉表示。

Result: 实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VLCA通过结合语言和视觉空间，提升了领域泛化的性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a
domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust
generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps,
it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that
is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision
space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively
convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and
intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and
vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as
the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the
completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic
representation of the relations between categories through word vector
distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of
image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is
explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language
representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal
space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ArtistAuditor的新方法，用于审计文本到图像生成模型是否使用了特定艺术家的作品进行微调，通过分析风格特征实现高效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如扰动或水印）在艺术品或模型已发布后无法修改或重新训练时的局限性，保护艺术家的版权。

Method: 使用风格提取器获取多粒度风格表示，将艺术品视为艺术家风格的采样，并通过训练判别器进行审计决策。

Result: 在六种模型和数据集组合上实验显示，ArtistAuditor的AUC值高于0.937，具有高效识别能力。

Conclusion: ArtistAuditor在真实场景中表现优异，开源并提供了实际应用的见解。

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

Motivation: 现有的LVMs在视频理解中存在与人类直觉不对齐和视频幻觉问题，需要一种更精细的对齐方法。

Method: 提出VistaDPO框架，在实例、时间和感知三个层次上优化文本-视频偏好对齐，并构建VistaDPO-7k数据集支持训练。

Result: 实验表明VistaDPO显著提升了LVMs在视频幻觉、视频问答和字幕任务中的性能。

Conclusion: VistaDPO有效缓解了视频-语言不对齐和幻觉问题，为视频理解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human
intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we
introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal
Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference
alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall
video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal
semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial
objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained
video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of
7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with
spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video
Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that
VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively
mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

Abstract: We propose a method to transfer pose and expression between face images.
Given a source and target face portrait, the model produces an output image in
which the pose and expression of the source face image are transferred onto the
target identity. The architecture consists of two encoders and a mapping
network that projects the two inputs into the latent space of StyleGAN2, which
finally generates the output. The training is self-supervised from video
sequences of many individuals. Manual labeling is not required. Our model
enables the synthesis of random identities with controllable pose and
expression. Close-to-real-time performance is achieved.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into
generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis.
First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset
comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct
scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore,
an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images
based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the
scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.
Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,
comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning
phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism
of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to
human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by
experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中，同时实现搜索准确性和效率具有挑战性，因为多样化的上下文表示会增加计算和内存成本。

Method: 提出原型化PRVR框架，通过固定数量的原型编码视频上下文，引入文本关联和视频理解增强策略，以及跨模态和单模态重构任务。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet-Captions和QVHighlights上的评估验证了方法的有效性，且未牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 原型化框架成功解决了PRVR中准确性与效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and
efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced
in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse
context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances
accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this
dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse
contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce
several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within
the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the
prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes
searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we
implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal
reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared
space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts
during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide
weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual
representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and
QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing
efficiency.

Method: 引入事件信号，设计互惠特征去模糊模块和混合可变形对齐模块，结合帧与事件信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现最优，比FMA-Net准确度提升2.59 dB，速度快7.28倍。

Conclusion: Ev-DeblurVSR通过事件信号有效提升了模糊视频超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),
aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and
blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high
resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient
motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in
LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR
and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse
information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a
reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from
intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global
scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to
enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module
that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame
events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable
alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and
7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified
garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more
challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,
lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers
multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it

Result: 合成字幕显著提升模型性能，在35个任务中性能提升至少6.2%，并降低FID分数。

Conclusion: 合成字幕是预训练的有效替代方案，Hunyuan-Recap100M数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has
experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement
of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training
paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality
image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the
availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce
and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.
This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for
vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale
low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a
viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)
achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language
models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key
contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,
low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO
methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,
the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%
to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals
that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their
counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data
achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text
pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support
in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1
on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation
benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and
knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型在复杂指令下的表现缺乏系统性评估，因此需要开发一个全面的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 利用GPT-4o自动生成多样化的编辑指令，采用“Chain-of-Edit”流程生成复杂指令，并设计了一套评估指标和自动评估流程。

Result: 开源模型表现显著落后于闭源模型；指令复杂度增加会降低模型保留关键元素和美学质量的能力；分步执行复杂指令会显著降低性能；Best-of-N策略能提升结果；合成数据训练会导致编辑图像呈现合成化趋势。

Conclusion: Complex-Edit基准测试为评估图像编辑模型提供了系统工具，揭示了开源模型的不足和复杂指令对模型性能的影响，同时指出了合成数据训练的潜在问题。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across
instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness
GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale.
Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first
generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them
to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of
metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a
VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our
benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly
underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the
performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased
instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key
elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;
3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed
in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple
metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for
both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe
a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model
training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly
synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon
that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful
compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is
limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and
performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to
increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a
prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology
data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing
reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using
guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures
biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We
demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset
achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models
trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our
synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across
multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on
orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic
and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several
evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create
compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the
reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our
approach.

*Yifeng Cheng,Juan Du*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Perlin噪声和表面参数化的3D异常生成方法3D-PNAS，用于解决工业异常检测中3D数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中3D数据的稀缺限制了视觉基础模型的潜力，而3D异常生成技术尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过将点云投影到2D平面，从Perlin噪声场采样多尺度噪声值，并沿法线方向扰动点云，生成逼真的3D表面异常。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成多样化的缺陷模式，并在不同物体类型上产生几何合理的异常。

Conclusion: 3D-PNAS为3D工业质量检测提供了有效的异常生成工具，并提供了代码库和可视化工具包以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in
various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity
of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.
While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established
generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has
made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In
contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,
limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address
this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,
based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates
realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,
sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the
point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization
experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,
perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the
generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from
pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our
cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet
geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to
their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive
codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

*Jiawei Zhang,Yu Zhang,Wei Xu,Yifei Zhang,Weiran Jiang,Qi Jiao,Yao Ren,Ziyou Song*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于群体学习（SL）的电池管理系统，通过分散式框架和基于可信度权重的模型合并机制，在数据有限的情况下提升电池容量估计的准确性，同时确保数据隐私和安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法在电池管理中潜力巨大，但数据有限时性能不佳，且缺乏同时确保数据隐私和容错性的框架。

Method: 采用分散式群体学习框架和基于可信度权重的模型合并机制，验证了66个商用电池在不同工况下的性能。

Result: SL在所有数据有限的情况下均提升了估计准确性，并在数据充足时达到与集中学习相当的精度。

Conclusion: 群体学习框架能有效解决数据有限和隐私安全问题，为电池管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery
management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is
bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery
data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable
data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that
simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This
paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized
swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging
mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios
while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework
is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled
under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation
performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased,
feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can
enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar
level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are
available.

*Robert de Mello Koch,Animik Ghosh*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 论文提出深度学习分为快速拟合和缓慢压缩两个阶段，支持这一观点的现象包括grokking、双下降和信息瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习训练过程中不同阶段的动态特性，特别是泛化能力的延迟出现。

Method: 通过实证研究，分析隐藏层与输入数据的互信息作为进展指标。

Result: 发现第二阶段的压缩并未被标准训练算法主动优化，可能延长训练时间。

Conclusion: 压缩阶段类似于重整化群，是一种关键的原则性遗忘机制，对泛化至关重要。

Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a
rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining
phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three
phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of
which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error
reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two
rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input
data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics
such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the
second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may
be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization
group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of
forgetting, critical for generalization.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个AI知识图谱系统，分析SDG之间的关联，并提出潜在新目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着2030年临近，SDG进展滞后，需要创新策略加速实现目标。

Method: 利用官方SDG文本、Elsevier关键词数据集和TED演讲转录，结合AI推测设计和大型语言模型进行分析。

Result: 发现目标10与16关联强，目标6覆盖少；知识图谱揭示新中心节点；提出6个潜在新目标。

Conclusion: 该AI框架为政策制定者提供新见解，并为未来多模态和跨系统SDG应用奠定基础。

Abstract: From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global
priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more
dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress
lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an
AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover
potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts,
Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot
on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,
and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis
reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage
of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new
central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal
clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,
resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework
offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future
multimodal and cross-system SDG applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了德美两国公众对AI系统功能特征的期望差异，发现美国对AI的接受度和支持度更高，而德国对公平和理想目标的支持更谨慎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解公众对AI系统的期望及其跨国差异，为AI治理和政策讨论提供实证基础。

Method: 通过德国（n=1800）和美国（n=1756）的两项调查，分析公众对AI系统功能特征的支持程度。

Result: 美国受访者对AI的使用和支持度更高；两国均最支持准确性和安全性，但对公平和理想目标的支持较谨慎，尤其是德国。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将公众态度纳入AI治理讨论的重要性，并揭示了跨国差异对AI政策制定的影响。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public
awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications.
Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems
meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values.
However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and
how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence
from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of
AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We
examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and
reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational
imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and
consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader
technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both
countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more
normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries --
receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how
individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political
ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and
free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S.
responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure
to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates
on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More
broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment
debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded
expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of
AI-generated content.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于命名实体识别（NER）技术的数据集，用于从大规模枪击事件中提取关键信息，如罪犯、受害者、地点和犯罪工具，并通过大型语言模型（LLMs）进行高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模枪击事件产生大量非结构化文本数据，现有研究难以自动化提取关键信息以支持法律和调查工作。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（如GPT-4o和o1-mini）进行命名实体识别（NER），通过少样本提示从新闻、警方报告和社交媒体中提取信息。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o在NER任务中表现最佳，o1-mini在资源有限时是高效替代方案。增加样本量能提升所有模型性能，尤其对GPT-4o和o1-mini效果显著。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模枪击事件的信息提取提供了有效工具，GPT-4o和o1-mini在少样本学习中表现优异。

Abstract: Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,
generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective
investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few
prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from
these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented
the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events
through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It
focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and
criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The
NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot
prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical
information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and
social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora
demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,
achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.
Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a
resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed
that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the
gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior
adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）对在线教育的实际影响，尤其是学术诚信和学习方式的潜在变化。

Method: 分析AI伦理课程的学生论文数据，比较ChatGPT发布前后的变化，包括长度、风格和关键词频率。

Result: ChatGPT发布后，学生论文的长度和风格显著变化，AI相关关键词频率增加，但主题未明显改变。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型对在线教育的影响主要体现在形式和风格上，而非内容主题，需进一步关注其长期影响。

Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern
in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to
generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual
accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and
computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to
unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we
quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs)
on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay
responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes
essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the
launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and
style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as
academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public
discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs,
but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student
essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除贫困是联合国可持续发展目标的首要任务，但社会对贫困人群的偏见（aporophobia）阻碍了扶贫政策的制定和实施。

Method: 与非营利组织和政府合作，收集并标注英文推文，构建分类器以识别社交媒体上的aporophobia表达。

Result: 开发了aporophobia的分类体系，并训练了分类器，揭示了自动检测的主要挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模识别和缓解社交媒体上的aporophobia奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eradicating poverty is the first goal in the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. However, aporophobia -- the societal bias against people
living in poverty -- constitutes a major obstacle to designing, approving and
implementing poverty-mitigation policies. This work presents an initial step
towards operationalizing the concept of aporophobia to identify and track
harmful beliefs and discriminative actions against poor people on social media.
In close collaboration with non-profits and governmental organizations, we
conduct data collection and exploration. Then we manually annotate a corpus of
English tweets from five world regions for the presence of (1) direct
expressions of aporophobia, and (2) statements referring to or criticizing
aporophobic views or actions of others, to comprehensively characterize the
social media discourse related to bias and discrimination against the poor.
Based on the annotated data, we devise a taxonomy of categories of aporophobic
attitudes and actions expressed through speech on social media. Finally, we
train several classifiers and identify the main challenges for automatic
detection of aporophobia in social networks. This work paves the way towards
identifying, tracking, and mitigating aporophobic views on social media at
scale.

Motivation: 研究匿名公共公告在公共公告逻辑中的形式化及其信息泄露的潜在影响，特别是在代理背景知识或匿名意图存在的情况下。

Method: 首先分析无匿名意图假设的情况，将匿名公共公告逻辑简化为认知逻辑；然后研究共同知识匿名意图的情况，将其与“安全”公告概念联系起来。

Result: 提出了形式化的表达结果，并证明了关键逻辑语言的公理完备性。

Conclusion: 匿名公共公告逻辑在不同假设下具有不同的复杂性，特别是在共同知识匿名意图的情况下，其与“安全”公告概念密切相关。

Abstract: We formalise the notion of an \emph{anonymous public announcement} in the
tradition of public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as
in-between a public announcement from ``the outside" (an announcement of
$\phi$) and a public announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of
$K_a\phi$): we get more information than just $\phi$, but not (necessarily)
about exactly who made it. Even if such an announcement is prima facie
anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal
the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the
information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore,
like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention
was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this
paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made,
in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is
reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common
knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and
more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe"
announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards). Main results include formal
expressivity results and axiomatic completeness for key logical languages.

Method: 提取视频中的物体位姿轨迹和手部初始位姿，定义奖励函数并引导强化学习训练。

Result: 在抓取、非抓取操作和多步任务中，性能分别优于基线方法55%和68%。

Conclusion: Human2Sim2Robot提供了一种高效、无需任务特定调优的机器人学习框架。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting
hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is
challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect
and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to
the lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences
between robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel
real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies
using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes
reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment
gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection
typically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we
extract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define
an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the
pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL
training. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning
the desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and
tuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop
trajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68%
across grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks. Project

Motivation: 建筑工地中存在重复特征（如平坦墙面和相似布局），导致机器人定位困难，需要高精度全局定位方法。

Method: 使用合成LiDAR点云训练扩散模型（基于PointNet++），生成多模态位置候选分布。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上测试，平均定位精度为77%±2m，性能优于基线方法两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对建筑工地中的感知混淆问题，提供多模态全局定位解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to
perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in
construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of
repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to
apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus
on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned
mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network
is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in
an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a
PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from
a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the
global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse
effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global
positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our
approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition
accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2
in mean error.

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as
robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or
heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these
simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between
simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a
physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of
well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only
minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency
yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We
demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned
friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately
simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially,
we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to
systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple
systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks,
offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap
in robotics and control.

Abstract: Adapting robot trajectories based on human instructions as per new situations
is essential for achieving more intuitive and scalable human-robot
interactions. This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt
generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like
RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained
LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense
robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than
current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of
commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art
feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method
does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and
more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation
experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the
Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can
successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.

driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive
decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an
explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or
who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness
using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to
analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader
scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph
structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our
method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated
relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach
achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model
effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object
identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal
relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the
potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning
approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex
object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced
autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality
demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits
such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital
twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language
models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned
evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates
varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and
interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code
generation framework that combines object annotations with large language
models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise
robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both
simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better
alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated
our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies
pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world
samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic
manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm
tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on
real-world data.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for robotic systems, yet
progress has been limited by hardware trade-offs between precision,
compactness, strength, and affordability. Existing control methods impose
compromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based
approaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to
address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This
work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable,

5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like
grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact,
human-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn
joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data
collected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and
strength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase
RUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of

Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for
the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The
development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces
challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex
environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task
balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The
method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning
strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to
jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The
channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic
features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on
the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\%
classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,
significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular
state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic
benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic
weighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This
work provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic
recognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal
processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RC忽略了神经元动态中的兴奋-抑制平衡，而这一平衡对大脑功能至关重要。本文旨在通过引入动态E-I平衡机制，提升RC的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种自适应的E-I平衡机制，局部调整以实现目标神经元放电率，并结合大脑启发的异质性设计。

Result: 在记忆能力和时间序列预测任务中，性能提升高达130%，且减少了对超参数调优的需求。

Conclusion: 动态适应机制显著提升了RC的性能和鲁棒性，为储层设计提供了新的方向，并深化了对神经计算的理解。

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to
deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired
computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random,
fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs
simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture.
Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal
dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is
essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically
perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming
excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter
tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance
to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in
tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally
tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing
rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs
to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from
static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating
how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while
deepening our understanding of neural computation.

(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling
the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose
EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language

control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme
tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by
chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we
introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring
expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language
descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English
EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese
Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability
of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human
perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and
Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are
crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production.
Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of
the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel
approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal
injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine
learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance
predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we
utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages
quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical
regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized
coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in
prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature
stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50
degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models
in industrial steel production applications.

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum
computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful
quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is
based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits
varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth,
width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our
featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a
widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and
depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum
computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example
benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to
produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression.
Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of
volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive
two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

Conclusion: 本文为量子信道区分的查询复杂度提供了理论框架，适用于经典和量子信道。

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic
perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error
probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this
paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein
the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a
desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of
binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error
probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and
Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely
characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical
channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of
binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel
discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric
R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends
on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For
multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the
number of channels.

Motivation: 零样本协作（ZSC）是人机协作AI的关键能力，但现有方法局限于单一任务，无法泛化到新任务。

Method: 通过在多环境中使用单一伙伴进行强化学习，开发了CEC范式，并引入了两个Jax-based生成器创建大量协作挑战。

Result: CEC在与人协作时表现优于基线方法，表明跨环境学习能促进代理发展通用协作规范。

Conclusion: 研究为设计无需人类数据的通用协作代理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a
cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior
work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these
specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly
similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of
environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills
that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two
Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination
challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation
(CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and
qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that
learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to
develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different
partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist
cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human
data.

Abstract: Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.

Motivation: 信用分配是MARL中的核心挑战，现有方法存在贡献分配不精确、可解释性差和扩展性不足等问题。

Method: 引入TFCAF概念，将信用分配过程表示为非线性函数，并采用coder-evaluator框架指导LLMs生成、验证和优化代码。

Result: 在多个标准MARL基准测试中，QLLM表现优于现有方法，并展现出强大的泛化能力和兼容性。

Conclusion: QLLM为复杂多智能体场景提供了一种有前景且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: 现有NWP后处理方法可直接用于AI模型，为气象中心提供低风险整合AI预报的途径。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching
operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and
reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's
existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic
Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against
post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any
modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields
comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in
both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with
NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the
most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing
methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling
national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing
workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.

### [240] [Provable Secure Steganography Based on Adaptive Dynamic Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12579)
*Kaiyi Pang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需显式访问生成模型分布的黑盒可证明安全隐写方案，通过动态采样策略实现高效秘密通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可证明安全隐写方法需显式访问生成模型分布，限制了黑盒场景的实用性。

Method: 采用动态采样策略，使生成模型在不干扰正常生成过程的情况下嵌入秘密消息。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三个LLM上的评估表明，该方法在效率和容量上与白盒方法相当，且避免了模型输出质量下降。

Conclusion: 该黑盒方法为隐写技术提供了更实用的解决方案，适用于更广泛的场景。

Abstract: The security of private communication is increasingly at risk due to
widespread surveillance. Steganography, a technique for embedding secret
messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored
channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making
stego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational
indistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current
PSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative
model for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme
that does not require access to explicit model distributions for both sender
and receiver. Our method incorporates a dynamic sampling strategy, enabling
generative models to embed secret messages within multiple sampling choices
without disrupting the normal generation process of the model. Extensive
evaluations of three real world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our
blackbox method is comparable with existing white-box steganography methods in
terms of efficiency and capacity while eliminating the degradation of
steganography in model generated outputs.

### [241] [MCP Guardian: A Security-First Layer for Safeguarding MCP-Based AI System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12757)
*Sonu Kumar,Anubhav Girdhar,Ritesh Patil,Divyansh Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCP Guardian是一个框架，通过认证、限流、日志记录、追踪和WAF扫描增强MCP的安全性，解决AI应用中数据孤岛和集成扩展问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的普及，模型能力快速提升，但数据孤岛和集成扩展问题限制了其发展。MCP协议虽提供了通用标准，但灵活性带来了新的安全风险。

Method: 提出MCP Guardian框架，通过认证、限流、日志记录、追踪和WAF扫描等技术，增强MCP通信的安全性。

Result: 实证测试表明，MCP Guardian能有效抵御攻击，确保稳健的监管，且开销极小。

Conclusion: MCP Guardian为AI助手提供了安全、可扩展的数据访问，强调了深度防御策略在AI驱动环境中的重要性。

Abstract: As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model
capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these
systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration
requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol
(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for
securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP
servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including
malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,
a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,
rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.
Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP
Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with
minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI
assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that
enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.

### [242] [Universal Approximation with XL MIMO Systems: OTA Classification via Trainable Analog Combining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12758)
*Kyriakos Stylianopoulos,George C. Alexandropoulos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将超大MIMO系统视为通用函数逼近器的方法，类似于前馈神经网络，通过模拟组合器实现高效的边缘推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超大MIMO系统在边缘推断中的潜力，避免传统数字处理的复杂性。

Method: 将XL MIMO信道系数视为隐藏层随机节点，接收器的模拟组合器作为可训练输出层，结合ELM框架。

Result: XL-MIMO-ELM实现了近乎即时的训练和高效分类，性能与深度学习相当但复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 超大MIMO系统可作为神经网络，为超低功耗无线设备提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining
components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator,
similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel
coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog
combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for
Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital
processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables
near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the
paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside
their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and
conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with
orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low
power wireless devices.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过知识图谱（KG）减少LLM的幻觉问题，提出了LinkQ系统，并在实验中表现优于GPT-4，但仍存在改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险的网络操作领域需要可信赖的AI方法，而LLM存在幻觉问题，因此需要研究如何通过KG提升其可靠性。

Method: 开发了LinkQ系统，强制LLM在问答过程中查询KG以获取真实数据，并通过定量和定性评估验证其效果。

Result: LinkQ在KGQA数据集上表现优于GPT-4，但在某些问题类别上仍有困难，专家反馈指出了系统的局限性和改进方向。

Conclusion: LinkQ展示了通过KG减少LLM幻觉的潜力，未来需探索更多查询策略以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: High-stakes domains like cyber operations need responsible and trustworthy AI
methods. While large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular
in these domains, they still suffer from hallucinations. This research paper
provides learning outcomes from a case study with LinkQ, an open-source natural
language interface that was developed to combat hallucinations by forcing an
LLM to query a knowledge graph (KG) for ground-truth data during
question-answering (QA). We conduct a quantitative evaluation of LinkQ using a
well-known KGQA dataset, showing that the system outperforms GPT-4 but still
struggles with certain question categories - suggesting that alternative query
construction strategies will need to be investigated in future LLM querying
systems. We discuss a qualitative study of LinkQ with two domain experts using
a real-world cybersecurity KG, outlining these experts' feedback, suggestions,
perceived limitations, and future opportunities for systems like LinkQ.

### [244] [Don't Just Translate, Agitate: Using Large Language Models as Devil's Advocates for AI Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12424)
*Ashley Suh,Kenneth Alperin,Harry Li,Steven R Gomez*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文指出，利用LLMs将XAI输出翻译为自然语言解释可能误导用户，建议LLMs应作为批判性工具，揭示模型局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在XAI中翻译解释的潜在问题，如用户过度依赖和虚假可解释性。

Method: 提出LLMs应扮演批判者角色，揭示模型局限性、偏见和不确定性。

Result: LLMs作为批判性工具可减少用户对AI的过度依赖。

Conclusion: LLMs应促进用户对AI解释的批判性思考，而非简单翻译。

Abstract: This position paper highlights a growing trend in Explainable AI (XAI)
research where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate outputs from
explainability techniques, like feature-attribution weights, into a natural
language explanation. While this approach may improve accessibility or
readability for users, recent findings suggest that translating into human-like
explanations does not necessarily enhance user understanding and may instead
lead to overreliance on AI systems. When LLMs summarize XAI outputs without
surfacing model limitations, uncertainties, or inconsistencies, they risk
reinforcing the illusion of interpretability rather than fostering meaningful
transparency. We argue that - instead of merely translating XAI outputs - LLMs
should serve as constructive agitators, or devil's advocates, whose role is to
actively interrogate AI explanations by presenting alternative interpretations,
potential biases, training data limitations, and cases where the model's
reasoning may break down. In this role, LLMs can facilitate users in engaging
critically with AI systems and generated explanations, with the potential to
reduce overreliance caused by misinterpreted or specious explanations.

*Mohi Reza,Jeb Thomas-Mitchell,Peter Dushniku,Nathan Laundry,Joseph Jay Williams,Anastasia Kuzminykh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI写作工具如何影响作者的自主权，通过系统综述和访谈揭示了不同写作阶段作者对AI干预的偏好差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补AI辅助写作对作者自主权影响的系统性理解空白。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法系统综述109篇HCI论文，并访谈15位跨领域作者。

Result: 发现作者在不同写作阶段对AI干预的偏好不同，且受目标、价值观和原创性观念影响。

Conclusion: 研究为开发以人为中心的AI协作写作工具提供了设计指导。

Abstract: As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing,
critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and
ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI
assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this
shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From
this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing
support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and
critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:
planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis
with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that
writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:
content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,
while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and
reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,
and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,
what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both
alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer
actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for
co-writing with AI, on human terms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合心理学和认知科学原理，探索MLLMs在视觉感知中的解释能力，以提升人类推理能力并揭示现有数据集的偏见。

Method: 利用心理学和认知科学的复杂性原则指导MLLMs解释视觉内容，提出了一种无需标注的分析框架。

Result: 论文为量化MLLMs的解释性提供了原则性方法，并展示了其在HCI任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs在认知科学和HCI中的应用奠定了基础，强调了其在提升人类推理和发现数据集偏见方面的价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context
of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing
on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the
applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To
this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology
and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use
them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual
content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability
principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that
primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics
from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive
model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to
assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual
perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled
study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for
applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in
existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

### [247] [WaterFlow: Learning Fast & Robust Watermarks using Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12354)
*Vinay Shukla,Prachee Sharma,Ryan Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Tong Yu,Aditya Grover*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: WaterFlow (WF) 是一种基于学习潜在依赖水印的快速且极其鲁棒的高保真视觉水印方法，解决了当前技术中的计算和统计挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前水印技术在计算速度和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，无法同时满足快速部署和高质量水印的需求。

Method: 利用预训练的潜在扩散模型将图像编码到潜在空间，并通过可逆流层在傅里叶域中嵌入水印，增强表达性。

Result: WaterFlow 在通用鲁棒性上表现最佳，并能有效防御组合攻击，在 MS-COCO、DiffusionDB 和 WikiArt 数据集上验证。

Conclusion: WaterFlow 是一种高效且鲁棒的水印方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of
interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated
imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from
computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for
practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking
speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this
work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high
fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our
approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary
image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted
into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via
invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the
pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and
tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of
effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our
findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO,
DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TUMLS的无监督多级分割方法，用于解决数字病理学中AI应用的挑战，如标注耗时、计算需求高和预测不确定性缺失。该方法通过自动编码器提取特征，选择代表性图像块进行无监督核分割，显著提升了工作流程效率和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在组织病理学中面临标注耗时、计算需求高和预测不确定性缺失等挑战，阻碍了其实际应用。

Method: TUMLS采用自动编码器作为特征提取器，识别低分辨率训练数据中的组织类型，选择代表性图像块进行无监督核分割，无需机器学习算法。

Result: 在UPENN-GBM数据集上，自动编码器的均方误差为0.0016；在MoNuSeg数据集上，核分割的F1分数为77.46%，Jaccard分数为63.35%，优于所有无监督方法。

Conclusion: TUMLS通过无缝集成到临床工作流程中，显著提升了数字病理学的效率和透明度，展示了其在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds
significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However,
challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs),
high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of
uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of
current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present
a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology
(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to
identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It
selects representative patches from each identified group based on an
uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their
respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially,
this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the
examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level
insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow
while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM
dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.
Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,
outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a
Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in
advancing the field of digital pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ViTa提出了一种多模态框架，结合心脏磁共振成像（CMR）和患者个体因素，以全面评估心脏健康。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMR方法未能整合患者个体健康因素，限制了心脏健康的全面评估。

Method: ViTa整合了42,000名UK Biobank参与者的3D+T影像数据和患者个体因素，通过多模态学习生成共享潜在表示。

Result: ViTa支持多种下游任务，如心脏表型预测、分割和疾病分类，提供更全面的心脏健康评估。

Conclusion: ViTa为心脏健康分析提供了通用且患者特异性的框架，具有临床实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive
cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,
and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and
disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand
cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an
individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly
exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have
begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data
and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a
comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a
comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of
individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,
ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling
a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with
detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This
multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including
cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and
classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified
framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging
features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific
models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,
highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in
cardiac analysis.

Method: 结合遍历理论和基于Transformer的机器学习算法，分析基因表达数据，量化衰老过程中的耗散动态。

Result: 提供了细胞衰老图谱（CAM），揭示了基因嵌入空间的发散、非线性转变和熵变化等衰老模式。

Conclusion: 衰老是一种耗散过程，提出的计算框架能以分子分辨率测量衰老相关变化。

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a
data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level.
We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and
show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological
systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to
non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a
transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data,
incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected
in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings,
we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of
divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy
variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide
a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a
computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with
molecular resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型分析（AA）因其直观、可解释的特性在高维数据分析中具有广泛应用，但面临非凸优化问题的挑战，本文旨在综述其方法、应用及未来方向。

Method: 通过综述原型分析的理论基础、优化方法及其在不同科学领域的应用，总结了使用AA的最佳实践和局限性。

Result: AA在特征提取和降维中表现出色，但其非凸优化问题限制了其效率和应用范围。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注改进AA的优化算法和扩展其应用领域，以进一步提升其性能和适用性。

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and
Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called
archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a
mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides
straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature
extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the
structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the
sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated
optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data
mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has
to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of
science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations.
The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions
concerning AA.

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of
functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate
distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and
the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of
the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend
to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions
used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious
models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for
simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

Conclusion: TransST在识别细胞亚群和检测驱动生物标志物方面既有效又稳健。

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in
biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts
and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest.
However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution
and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably
extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge,
we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to
adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in
inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of
simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing
techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully
identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two
subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is
able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the
studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and
robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving
biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact
reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from
a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By
quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the
Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the
mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion
transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the
critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes,
the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle
density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy
models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of
the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the
exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

Conclusion: VM-Posterior是一种可靠的工具，适用于复杂污染数据集中的贝叶斯推断。

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that
effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large
datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the
posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these
posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets
are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures,
computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation
method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We
rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties
akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors
or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable
robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a
variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian
distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational
family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms
for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive
numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability,
making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex,
contaminated datasets.

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze
and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised
learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in
real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may
differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of
spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the
framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case
of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input
data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional
distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this
setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show
that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the
training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also
identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the
spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we
propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio
information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this
weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates.
Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that
the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the
optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This
improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio
scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨随机化在随机森林中的双重作用（去相关和正则化），并分析其在不同SNR和数据特征下的表现。

Method: 通过系统分析不同SNR下的样本外均方误差（MSE），并结合模拟研究固定SNR下的数据特征（如厚尾分布、无关协变量、相关协变量）。

Result: 随机化在低SNR下有效，但在厚尾分布中增加偏差，无关协变量下无效，相关协变量下有效；相关协变量还能显著减少偏差。

Conclusion: 随机化的效果不仅取决于SNR，还受数据特征影响；相关协变量的发现为随机森林的实际应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests.
Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce
variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization
regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First,
we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a
systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR
scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that
variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform
bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias
for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a
question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and
moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other
data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can
increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates;
(ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective
because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually
correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias.
Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias
can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This
last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by
variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our
findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding
of why random forests work well in many applications.

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width
neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected
gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to
tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed
by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is
the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's
velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our
results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a
well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be
arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the
ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance''
property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded
by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are
sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

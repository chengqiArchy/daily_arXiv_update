### [1] [Unmasking the Reality of PII Masking Models: Performance Gaps and the Call for Accountability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12308)
*Devansh Singh,Sundaraparipurnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了隐私掩码技术在数据隐私中的应用，分析了基于NER的PII检测模型的局限性，并通过实验展示了这些模型在实际使用中的隐私暴露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估现有PII检测模型的质量，揭示其在处理敏感内容、变体表达和格式差异时的不足，以及由此导致的隐私风险。

Method: 方法包括构建一个包含16种PII类型的17K半合成句子数据集，并在五个NER检测维度和一个对抗性上下文中测试模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在多种场景下存在隐私暴露问题，尤其是考虑到其广泛下载量。

Conclusion: 结论强调了模型性能评估的不足，并呼吁在模型卡片中提供更全面的上下文披露。

Abstract: Privacy Masking is a critical concept under data privacy involving
anonymization and de-anonymization of personally identifiable information
(PII). Privacy masking techniques rely on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
approaches under NLP support in identifying and classifying named entities in
each text. NER approaches, however, have several limitations including (a)
content sensitivity including ambiguous, polysemic, context dependent or domain
specific content, (b) phrasing variabilities including nicknames and alias,
informal expressions, alternative representations, emerging expressions,
evolving naming conventions and (c) formats or syntax variations, typos,
misspellings. However, there are a couple of PII datasets that have been widely
used by researchers and the open-source community to train models on PII
detection or masking. These datasets have been used to train models including
Piiranha and Starpii, which have been downloaded over 300k and 580k times on
HuggingFace. We examine the quality of the PII masking by these models given
the limitations of the datasets and of the NER approaches. We curate a dataset
of 17K unique, semi-synthetic sentences containing 16 types of PII by compiling
information from across multiple jurisdictions including India, U.K and U.S. We
generate sentences (using language models) containing these PII at five
different NER detection feature dimensions - (1) Basic Entity Recognition, (2)
Contextual Entity Disambiguation, (3) NER in Noisy & Real-World Data, (4)
Evolving & Novel Entities Detection and (5) Cross-Lingual or multi-lingual NER)
and 1 in adversarial context. We present the results and exhibit the privacy
exposure caused by such model use (considering the extent of lifetime downloads
of these models). We conclude by highlighting the gaps in measuring performance
of the models and the need for contextual disclosure in model cards for such
models.

### [2] [Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311)
*Enming Zhang,Liwen Cao,Yanru Wu,Zijie Zhao,Guan Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HGPrompt是一种自适应框架，通过优化可迁移性和稳定性目标，解决多源提示聚合中的表示崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练提示作为知识资产，多源提示组合可提升新任务的泛化能力，但简单聚合会导致表示崩溃。

Method: 引入信息论指标评估提示特征的可迁移性，并提出梯度对齐正则化以减少梯度冲突。

Result: 在大规模VTAB基准测试中，HGPrompt达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HGPrompt有效解决了多源提示迁移中的干扰问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight adaptation strategy for adapting
foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly in resource-constrained
systems. As pre-trained prompts have become valuable intellectual assets,
combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance
generalization to new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge from diverse
sources. However, naive aggregation of these prompts often leads to
representation collapse due to mutual interference, undermining their
collective potential. To address these challenges, we propose HGPrompt, an
adaptive framework for multi-source prompt transfer that learns optimal
ensemble weights by jointly optimizing dual objectives: transferability and
stability. Specifically, we first introduce an information-theoretic metric to
evaluate the transferability of prompt-induced features on the target task,
capturing the intrinsic alignment between the feature representations.
Additionally, we propose a novel Gradient Alignment Regularization to mitigate
gradient conflicts among prompts, enabling stable and coherent knowledge
transfer from multiple sources while suppressing interference. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate that HGPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in
multi-source prompt transfer.

### [3] [Socrates or Smartypants: Testing Logic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models with Logic Programming-based Test Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12312)
*Zihao Xu,Junchen Ding,Yiling Lou,Kun Zhang,Dong Gong,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SmartyPat-Bench和SmartyPat，一个挑战性的逻辑谬误基准和自动化生成框架，用于评估大语言模型的逻辑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和基准在逻辑推理评估中过于简单或不自然，无法满足需求。

Method: 提出SmartyPat-Bench（基于Reddit的真实数据）和SmartyPat（基于Prolog规则和LLM的自动化框架）。

Result: SmartyPat生成的谬误与人工生成内容相当，且显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 实验揭示了LLM在谬误检测和分类中的能力，结构化推理有助于提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language
understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning
abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and
benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually
constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce
SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled
benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle
logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more
detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To
further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data
collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive
annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic
programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically
generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent
natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable
in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly
outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into
LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder
fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy
categorization performance.

### [4] [Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on Conversational Recommender Systems: A Simulation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12313)
*Xiaoyan Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenjie Wang,Hongzhan lin,Hong Cheng,Rui Zhang,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的个性化感知用户模拟系统（PerCRS），用于研究人格特质如何影响对话推荐系统的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格特质对用户交互行为有显著影响，但目前对话推荐系统（CRSs）中缺乏对此的系统研究。

Method: 引入PerCRS，通过用户代理模拟可定制的人格特质和偏好，系统代理具备说服能力以模拟真实交互。采用多角度评估确保鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，先进的LLM能生成符合指定人格特质的多样化用户响应，促使CRSs动态调整推荐策略。

Conclusion: 研究为理解人格特质对对话推荐系统结果的影响提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn
interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural
and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in
understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation
outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits
on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based
personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces
customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent
possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs.
We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct
extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user
responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to
dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis
offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes
of conversational recommender systems.

### [5] [How to Detect and Defeat Molecular Mirage: A Metric-Driven Benchmark for Hallucination in LLM-based Molecular Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12314)
*Hao Li,Liuzhenghao Lv,He Cao,Zijing Liu,Zhiyuan Yan,Yu Wang,Yonghong Tian,Yu Li,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）在分子理解任务中的幻觉问题，提出了一种新的评估指标Mol-Hallu，并设计了幻觉减少后处理阶段（HRPP）以缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在分子理解任务中存在幻觉问题，导致药物设计和利用中的错误，亟需解决以提高科学应用的可靠性。

Method: 首先分析幻觉来源，提出Mol-Hallu指标量化幻觉程度，并设计HRPP后处理阶段以减少幻觉。

Result: 实验证明HRPP在解码器和编码器-解码器分子LLMs中均有效。

Conclusion: 研究为减少幻觉和提高LLMs在科学应用中的可靠性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially
for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected
by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In
this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular
comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in
the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks
with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel
free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based
on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual
molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze
the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension
tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is
proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the
effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our
findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving
the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

*Xingguang Ji,Jiakang Wang,Hongzhi Zhang,Jingyuan Zhang,Haonan Zhou,Chenxi Sun,Yahui Liu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Capybara-OMNI是一个轻量高效的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），支持文本、图像、视频和音频模态，通过详细框架设计、数据构建和训练方法实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于构建和训练多模态数据对的复杂性，开发强大的MLLM仍是一个计算和时间密集型任务。

Method: 提出Capybara-OMNI，详细介绍其框架设计、数据构建和训练方法，并提供专用基准验证多模态理解能力。

Result: 遵循该方法可高效构建性能竞争的同规模MLLM，并进一步训练聊天版本以增强多模态指令跟随和对话能力。

Conclusion: 公开了Capybara-OMNI及其聊天版本的模型权重、部分训练数据和推理代码，促进社区研究。

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous
outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due
to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a
computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work,
we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient
manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We
present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training
recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We
also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to
properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results
show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that
achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various
multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction
following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how
to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in
line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We
publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version.
The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data,
and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

*Jingyuan Zhang,Hongzhi Zhang,Zhou Haonan,Chenxi Sun,Xingguang ji,Jiakang Wang,Fanheng Kong,Yahui Liu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“数据代谢”的数据中心框架，用于构建视觉语言模型（VLM），并通过数据迭代和优化提升模型性能。发布的Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，甚至超越了一些更大的开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据管理对训练强大的视觉语言模型至关重要，但现有方法在数据迭代和优化方面存在不足。

Method: 提出数据代谢框架，通过数据管理和迭代形成闭环系统，优化模型性能。

Result: Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，超越了一些更大的开源模型，并与领先专有模型持平。

Conclusion: 数据中心框架能够训练出更小、更高效的视觉语言模型，展示了其巨大潜力。

Abstract: Data curation plays a crucial role in training powerful Visual Language
Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Metabolism and
present our data-centric framework to build VLMs throughout the development
lifecycle. Starting from a standard model architecture, we discuss and provide
insights into two crucial development steps: data curation and iteration,
forming a closed-loop system that continuously improves model performance. We
show a detailed codebook on how to process existing massive datasets and build
user-specific data flywheel. As a demonstration, we release a VLM, named
Capybara-VL, which excels in typical multimodal tasks (e.g. , visual question
answering, scientific reasoning, and text-rich tasks). Despite its relatively
compact size, Capybara-VL surpasses several open-source models that are up to
10 times larger in size. Moreover, it achieves results that are on par with
those of several leading proprietary models, demonstrating its remarkable
competitiveness. These results highlight the power of our data-centric
framework and the potential of training smaller and more efficient VLMs.

### [8] [ChatGPT as Linguistic Equalizer? Quantifying LLM-Driven Lexical Shifts in Academic Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12317)
*Dingkang Lin,Naixuan Zhao,Dan Tian,Jiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT显著提升了非英语母语学者（NNES）在学术写作中的词汇复杂性，减少了语言障碍，促进了学术公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT是否能帮助非英语母语学者克服学术写作中的语言障碍，促进全球学术公平。

Method: 使用OpenAlex数据库中2020-2024年的280万篇文章，通过MTLD量化词汇复杂性，并采用DID设计分析因果效应。

Result: ChatGPT显著提升了NNES作者摘要的词汇复杂性，尤其在预印本、技术和生物领域以及低级别期刊中效果最明显。

Conclusion: ChatGPT有效减少了语言差异，推动了全球学术公平。

Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has profoundly reshaped scientific research practices,
particularly in academic writing, where non-native English-speakers (NNES)
historically face linguistic barriers. This study investigates whether ChatGPT
mitigates these barriers and fosters equity by analyzing lexical complexity
shifts across 2.8 million articles from OpenAlex (2020-2024). Using the Measure
of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) to quantify vocabulary sophistication and a
difference-in-differences (DID) design to identify causal effects, we
demonstrate that ChatGPT significantly enhances lexical complexity in
NNES-authored abstracts, even after controlling for article-level controls,
authorship patterns, and venue norms. Notably, the impact is most pronounced in
preprint papers, technology- and biology-related fields and lower-tier
journals. These findings provide causal evidence that ChatGPT reduces
linguistic disparities and promotes equity in global academia.

### [9] [Has the Creativity of Large-Language Models peaked? An analysis of inter- and intra-LLM variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12320)
*Jennifer Haase,Paul H. P. Hanel,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在创意任务中表现接近或超过人类，但其创意能力并未随时间提升，且输出存在显著的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的创意能力是否随时间提升，并评估其创意输出的稳定性。

Method: 使用Divergent Association Task (DAT)和Alternative Uses Task (AUT)对14种LLMs进行评估。

Result: LLMs的创意表现未随时间改善，GPT-4表现下降；AUT中LLMs平均优于人类，但极少达到人类顶尖水平；同一模型输出差异显著。

Conclusion: 需更细致的评估框架，重视模型选择、提示设计和重复测试，以准确评估LLMs的创意潜力。

Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies
reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human
performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have
become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In
this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,
Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the
Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary
to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over
the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.
For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the
average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of
LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.
Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model
variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging
from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for
both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability
risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or
underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs
differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation
frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and
repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative
contexts.

### [10] [AttentionDefense: Leveraging System Prompt Attention for Explainable Defense Against Novel Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12321)
*Charlotte Siska,Anush Sankaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AttentionDefense的新方法，利用小型语言模型（SLM）的系统提示注意力来检测对抗性提示，提供了一种可解释且低成本的防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型（LM）易受恶意输入攻击（jailbreak），现有防御方法难以解释恶意行为的原因，因此需要一种可解释且高效的防御方法。

Method: 通过SLM的系统提示注意力机制，分析对抗性提示的特征，提出AttentionDefense方法，并在基准数据集和新型jailbreak数据集上进行评估。

Result: AttentionDefense在检测性能上优于基于文本嵌入的分类器和GPT-4零样本检测器，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: AttentionDefense是一种高效、可解释且低成本的防御方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human
capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and
exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious
input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended
behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as
adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is
challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,
which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we
propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models
(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,
explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research
suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding
and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the
semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated
against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that
SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection
performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot
detectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark
dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that
the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel
jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.
Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as
it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM
detector.

*Xin Gao,Qizhi Pei,Zinan Tang,Yu Li,Honglin Lin,Jiang Wu,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GRA的框架，通过多个小型LLM协作模拟同行评审流程，实现高质量数据合成，挑战了大型LLM的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依赖大型LLM的数据合成方法存在高成本、低效率和潜在偏见问题，而小型LLM个体能力不足。

Method: GRA框架将小型LLM分为Generator、Reviewer和Adjudicator三个角色，通过协作完成数据合成。

Result: 实验表明，GRA生成的数据质量与大型LLM相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究表明，小型LLM的战略协作可以替代大型LLM，实现高效、高质量的数据合成。

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance
small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models
(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,
and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,
smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual
capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable
data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose
a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized
roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically
achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small
LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a
peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial
data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the
Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the
synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can
achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through
experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data
matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large
models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic
coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly
available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG通过引入外部知识减少LLMs的幻觉问题，但其公平性影响尚不明确。研究发现小规模LLMs（<8B）在RAG中公平性更差，并提出FairFT和FairFilter两种方法改善公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG范式对LLMs公平性的影响，尤其是在社会影响较大的领域。

Method: 通过实验分析不同规模LLMs、检索器和检索源的影响，并提出FairFT（公平对齐检索器）和FairFilter（公平过滤机制）两种方法。

Result: 小规模LLMs（<8B）在RAG中公平性更差；FairFT和FairFilter能有效改善公平性且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: RAG对小规模LLMs的公平性有负面影响，但通过FairFT和FairFilter可以显著改善这一问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing
this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually
incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,
there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of
RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded
significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable
societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact
does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To
address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,
retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the
scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes
within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the
integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale
LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness
issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,
FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the
LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate
fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism
to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed
approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
improving fairness while maintaining performance.

*Mengying Yuan,Wangzi Xuan,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的跨文档跨语言自然语言推理（CDCL-NLI）范式，构建了一个高质量的数据集，并提出了一种结合RST增强图融合和可解释性预测的创新方法，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档跨语言NLI（CDCL-NLI）是一个未被充分探索的领域，本文旨在填补这一空白，扩展NLI在多文档和多语言场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种结合RST增强的图融合和可解释性预测的方法，利用RGAT进行跨文档上下文建模，并通过基于词汇链的结构感知语义对齐机制实现跨语言理解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于传统NLI模型（如DocNLI和R2F）及大型语言模型（如Llama3和GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 本文为NLI研究提供了新视角，并推动了跨文档跨语言上下文理解、语义检索和可解释性推理的研究。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural
language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many
sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual
NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional
NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this
task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances
and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose
an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and
interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure
Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document
context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism
based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI
interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates
extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's
superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional
NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our

*Haiqi Zhang,Zhengyuan Zhu,Zeyu Zhang,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMTaxo是一个利用大语言模型自动构建社交媒体事实声明分类框架，通过多粒度生成主题，帮助用户更有效地导航社交媒体内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体内容的爆炸式增长，分析和理解在线讨论变得日益复杂，需要一种自动化方法来分类事实声明。

Method: LLMTaxo框架利用不同的大语言模型在三个数据集上实现，并设计了专门的分类评估指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMTaxo能有效分类社交媒体事实声明，且某些模型在特定数据集上表现更好。

Conclusion: LLMTaxo为社交媒体事实声明的分类提供了有效工具，未来可进一步优化模型选择。

Abstract: With the vast expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and
comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper
introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the
automated construction of taxonomy of factual claims from social media by
generating topics from multi-level granularities. This approach aids
stakeholders in more effectively navigating the social media landscapes. We
implement this framework with different models across three distinct datasets
and introduce specially designed taxonomy evaluation metrics for a
comprehensive assessment. With the evaluations from both human evaluators and
GPT-4, the results indicate that LLMTaxo effectively categorizes factual claims
from social media, and reveals that certain models perform better on specific
datasets.

### [15] [Reconstructing Sepsis Trajectories from Clinical Case Reports using LLMs: the Textual Time Series Corpus for Sepsis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12326)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型从临床病例报告中提取时间定位发现的管道，并生成了一个关于Sepsis-3的开放文本时间序列语料库，验证了模型的高恢复率和强时间排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床病例报告和出院总结虽然完整准确，但通常在患者接触后才完成，而结构化数据流虽然更早可用但不完整。为了在更完整且时间粒度更细的数据上训练模型，需要一种方法从文本中提取时间定位的临床发现。

Method: 构建了一个管道，利用大语言模型对病例报告中的发现进行表型提取和时间标注，并应用于生成Sepsis-3的开放语料库。通过比较PMOA和I2B2/MIMIC-IV的标注结果与专家标注进行验证。

Result: 模型在临床发现的恢复率（事件匹配率：O1-preview--0.755，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753）和时间排序（一致性：O1-preview--0.932，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究展示了大语言模型在文本中时间定位临床发现的能力，但也指出了其在时间重建中的局限性，并提出了通过多模态集成改进的潜在途径。

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and
accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e.,
timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become
available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms
on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to
phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports
using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access
textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the
Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA
and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to
physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings
(event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and
strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize
clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal
reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via
multimodal integration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过计算分析中国官方媒体（1950-2019）的语言模式，探讨社会变革如何反映在官方对社会群体的描述中，发现与西方模式显著不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示中国官方媒体如何通过语言编码社会群体的信念，填补非西方语境下社会语言学研究的空白。

Method: 使用历时词嵌入方法，分析中国官方媒体在不同时间分辨率下的语言模式。

Result: 发现中国对社会群体的描述与西方显著不同，尤其是经济地位、种族和性别；性别和经济阶层的描述随历史变革剧烈变化，而种族、年龄和体型刻板印象则相对稳定。

Conclusion: 研究强调了非西方视角在计算社会科学中的重要性，并揭示了官方话语如何通过语言编码社会结构。

Abstract: Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns.
While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis
of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western
contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese
state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social
transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social
groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we
find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western
counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender.
These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of
ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political
upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic
shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our
understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure
through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives
in computational social science.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Speculative Thinking”的无训练框架，通过让大型推理模型指导小型模型在推理级别上提升性能，显著提高了推理准确性和输出效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法成本高且输出冗长，需要一种更高效的方法提升模型推理性能。

Method: 利用大型模型在反射行为上的优势，通过策略性地将反射步骤委托给更强大的模型，优化推理过程。

Result: 在MATH500上，1.5B模型的准确率从83.2%提升至89.4%，输出长度减少15.7%；非推理模型Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct的准确率从74.0%提升至81.8%。

Conclusion: Speculative Thinking框架显著提升了推理模型的性能，同时减少了输出长度，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning
performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still
suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. We introduce Speculative
Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to
guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from
speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based
on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently
appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for
reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over
reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving
reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more
capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of
reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B
reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to
89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average
output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7%
decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model
(Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), our framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8%
on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%.

TL;DR: HM-RAG提出了一种分层多智能体多模态RAG框架，通过协作智能解决复杂查询，显著提升了答案准确性和问题分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单智能体RAG在处理需要跨异构数据协调推理的复杂查询时存在局限性。

Method: 采用三层架构：分解代理、多源检索代理和决策代理，结合语义感知查询重写、模式引导上下文增强和一致性投票。

Result: 在ScienceQA和CrisisMMD基准测试中，答案准确性提升12.95%，问题分类准确性提升3.56%，并在零样本设置中达到最优结果。

Conclusion: HM-RAG通过模块化架构和多模态协作，显著提升了RAG系统的多模态推理和知识合成能力。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains
fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated
reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel
Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative
intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured,
and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture
with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries
into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and
schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry
out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed
for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses
consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies
in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains
comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and
web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer
accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline
RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG
establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets.
Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities
while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in
addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge
synthesis in RAG systems. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的细粒度方法，用于提取文本中的情感-原因-类别三元组，通过指令调优和数据增强技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在冗余信息检索和情感类别确定上的困难，尤其是隐式或模糊情感表达的问题。

Method: 采用任务特定的三元组提取指令，利用低秩适应调优大语言模型，并结合提示数据增强策略生成高质量合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感-原因-类别三元组提取指标上至少提升了12.8%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且鲁棒，为情感原因分析研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and
complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying
emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the
text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly
concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level
emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating
from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining
emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or
ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained
approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces
an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation
techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs
task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation
to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate
task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation
strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models
in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level
emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for
advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at

Motivation: 探讨LLM的能力是否真正接近人类能力，并量化其表现。

Method: 收集80多个LLM在37个基准测试中的性能数据，分类为6种主要能力和11种子能力，并进行聚类分析。

Result: 1. 少于100亿参数的LLM的某些能力可用人类能力指标描述；2. 人类中相关的能力在LLM中几乎不相关；3. LLM的能力随参数规模显著变化。

Conclusion: LLM的能力与人类能力存在部分重叠，但关联性较弱，且受参数规模影响显著。

Abstract: Users of Large Language Models (LLMs) often perceive these models as
intelligent entities with human-like capabilities. However, the extent to which
LLMs' capabilities truly approximate human abilities remains a topic of debate.
In this paper, to characterize the capabilities of LLMs in relation to human
capabilities, we collected performance data from over 80 models across 37
evaluation benchmarks. The evaluation benchmarks are categorized into 6 primary
abilities and 11 sub-abilities in human aspect. Then, we then clustered the
performance rankings into several categories and compared these clustering
results with classifications based on human ability aspects. Our findings lead
to the following conclusions: 1. We have confirmed that certain capabilities of
LLMs with fewer than 10 billion parameters can indeed be described using human
ability metrics; 2. While some abilities are considered interrelated in humans,
they appear nearly uncorrelated in LLMs; 3. The capabilities possessed by LLMs
vary significantly with the parameter scale of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开放式回答在严肃游戏中的正确性具有主观性，小型LLM的准确性和一致性尚不明确，因此需要研究其可靠性。

Method: 利用传统二元分类指标（如准确率、真阳性率和真阴性率）系统比较五种小型LLM在不同评估场景中的表现。

Result: 结果显示不同模型在识别正确回答和避免假阳性方面表现不一，存在性能权衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发上下文感知的评估框架，并谨慎选择模型，为AI驱动的评估工具可信度提供了新见解。

Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique
challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy
and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for
local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale
LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates
decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary
classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true
negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different
evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of
each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct
responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations.
The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and
careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work
contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven
assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle
subjective evaluation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂医学任务中因术语和临床数据敏感性导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出基于树状思维（ToT）的QM-ToT框架，分解问题并引入评估层，结合数据蒸馏方法。

Result: LLaMA2-70b准确率从34%提升至50%，LLaMA-3.1-8b从58.77%提升至69.49%；数据蒸馏效率提升86.27%。

Conclusion: QM-ToT首次展示ToT在复杂医学任务中的潜力，为资源受限环境下的高性能量化模型部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized
biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the
sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate
medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to
performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To
address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a
path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT)
reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable
subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates
substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the
challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable
accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to
69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation
method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we
achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work,
for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance
performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for
future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited
medical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM通常通过API提供服务，开发者难以检测其行为变化，因此需要一种轻量级监控方法。

Method: 比较两个文本样本的语言和心理语言学特征分布，使用统计测试判断是否等效。

Result: 实验表明，简单文本特征结合统计测试能区分不同语言模型，并可检测提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效监控LLM变化，避免计算密集型基准评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API,
making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We
present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions
of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses
a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two
samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has
changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI
completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that
simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between
language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt
injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids
computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

Motivation: 生成式AI聊天机器人（如ChatGPT）在心理健康支持中的角色引发了公众和学术界的兴趣，研究旨在了解用户如何利用LLMs进行心理健康支持。

Method: 通过分析TikTok视频评论，采用分层编码模式和监督分类模型，识别用户体验、态度和主题。

Result: 20%的评论反映个人使用，用户态度积极，认为LLMs具有可访问性、情感支持和治疗价值，但也存在隐私和缺乏专业监督等问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI在日常实践中的重要性，但也指出需要临床和伦理审查以确保AI在心理健康支持中的安全使用。

Abstract: The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing
public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support
tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large
language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency,
empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with
LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from
videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered
coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user
experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of
comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly
positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional
support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy,
generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It
is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic
framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings
underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also
highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI
for mental health support.

Motivation: 传统预测模型无法充分利用非结构化临床笔记中的信息，而GPT等大型语言模型可能填补这一空白。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV Note数据集中的14,011例首次入院患者数据，以GPT回答作为逻辑回归模型的输入特征。

Result: GPT模型单独表现优于传统表格数据模型，结合两者后AUC平均提升5.1%，高风险组的阳性预测值提升29.9%。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在临床预测任务中具有重要价值，尤其在非结构化文本数据未被充分利用的领域。

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using
tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to
extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document
diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we
investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical
questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary,
can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011
first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care
Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that
uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our
findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained
on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields
even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage
points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the
highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large
language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the
broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data
remains an underutilized resource.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在TTS任务中存在声学特征丢失、依赖严格对齐数据以及优化过程中遗忘文本理解能力的问题。

Method: 提出双分支架构：1）模态对齐分支捕捉连续声学嵌入；2）语音生成分支通过模块化微调预测语音标记。

Result: 实验表明GOAT-TTS性能与SOTA模型相当，并验证了方言语音合成的有效性。

Conclusion: GOAT-TTS通过双分支设计解决了现有问题，为TTS任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS)
synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures
exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible
loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2)
stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit
real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text
comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these
challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach
Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework
introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a
speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings,
enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language,
timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript
dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on
top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k
layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token
prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis.
Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of
synthesized dialect speech data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates state-of-the-art,
domain-specific large language models with advanced information retrieval
techniques to deliver comprehensive and context-aware responses. Our approach
facilitates seamless interaction among diverse components, enabling
cross-validation of outputs to produce accurate, high-quality responses
enriched with relevant data, images, tables, and other modalities. We
demonstrate the system's capability to enhance response precision by leveraging
a robust question-answering model, significantly improving the quality of
dialogue generation. The system provides an accessible platform for real-time,
high-fidelity interactions, allowing users to benefit from efficient
human-computer interaction, precise retrieval, and simultaneous access to a
wide range of literature and data. This dramatically improves the research
efficiency of professionals in the biomedical and pharmaceutical domains and
facilitates faster, more informed decision-making throughout the R\&D process.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个针对生物制药领域的检索增强生成评估基准BRAGE，并提出了一种基于引用的分类方法评估LLMs的查询与参考理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏专门评估生物制药领域LLMs的基准，且传统QA指标在开放检索增强QA场景中不足。

Method: 提出BRAGE基准和基于引用的分类方法，评估主流LLMs在生物制药领域的QRUC。

Result: 实验显示主流LLMs在生物制药QRUC上存在显著差距，需改进。

Conclusion: BRAGE填补了领域空白，基于引用的方法有效评估QRUC，为LLMs改进提供方向。

Abstract: Recently, the application of the retrieval-augmented Large Language Models
(LLMs) in specific domains has gained significant attention, especially in
biopharmaceuticals. However, in this context, there is no benchmark
specifically designed for biopharmaceuticals to evaluate LLMs. In this paper,
we introduce the Biopharmaceuticals Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation
(BRAGE) , the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' Query and Reference
Understanding Capability (QRUC) in the biopharmaceutical domain, available in
English, French, German and Chinese. In addition, Traditional
Question-Answering (QA) metrics like accuracy and exact match fall short in the
open-ended retrieval-augmented QA scenarios. To address this, we propose a
citation-based classification method to evaluate the QRUC of LLMs to understand
the relationship between queries and references. We apply this method to
evaluate the mainstream LLMs on BRAGE. Experimental results show that there is
a significant gap in the biopharmaceutical QRUC of mainstream LLMs, and their
QRUC needs to be improved.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）中语义后门攻击的黑盒检测框架RAVEN，通过语义熵和跨模型一致性分析揭示隐藏的语义后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在语言任务中表现优异，但其易受语义后门攻击，传统防御方法无法检测基于概念级别的隐蔽触发机制。

Method: 在控制微调环境中植入语义后门，并开发RAVEN框架，结合语义熵和跨模型一致性分析检测异常输出。

Result: 实验证明RAVEN能有效发现多种LLM家族中的语义后门，首次验证了这些隐藏漏洞的存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调了概念级审计的必要性，并开源了代码和数据以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myriad
language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model
outputs. Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and
therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the
conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely
on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a
controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted
with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We
then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a
black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for
uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with
cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with
structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via
bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model
comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical
evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)
uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first
proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the
urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models. We
open-source our code and data at https://github.com/NayMyatMin/RAVEN.

Motivation: 城市因果研究面临假设生成效率低、数据复杂性高和方法脆弱性等挑战，LLM的出现为改进研究提供了新机会。

Method: 提出AutoUrbanCI框架，包含四个模块化代理：假设生成、数据工程、实验设计与执行、结果解释与政策建议。

Result: 框架旨在提高研究的严谨性和透明度，推动人机协作，增强公平性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用AI增强的工作流程，作为扩展参与、提升可重复性和包容性城市因果推理的工具。

Abstract: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of
cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the
inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data
complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how
urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban
causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data
sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then
introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four
distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data
engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with
policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and
transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity,
and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces
AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to
broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms
of urban causal reasoning.

Result: 初始表现中等，但随着模型进化，部分模型达到满分，媲美顶尖学生水平。

Conclusion: LLMs的数学能力进步迅速，展示了其在大规模教育评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational
settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This
study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish
matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary
education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to
mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements
as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect
or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for
university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the
mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential to also support
educational assessments at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床事件的时间信息对患者轨迹分析至关重要，但电子健康记录中缺乏结构化时间数据，临床报告也缺少事件的时间定位。

Method: 开发了一个系统，将病例报告转化为文本时间序列（事件和时间戳对），并对比了人工和LLM标注的效果。

Result: LLM在事件召回率上表现中等（0.80），但在时间一致性上表现优异（0.95）。

Conclusion: 通过建立任务、标注和评估系统，并展示高一致性，该研究为利用PMOA语料库进行时间分析提供了基准。

Abstract: Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient
trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and
causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few
data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal
localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms
case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and
timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations
(n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access
(PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93).
We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but
high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By
establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating
high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA
corpus for temporal analytics.

Conclusion: AI框架在公共卫生监测和个性化干预中具有潜力。

Abstract: Drug overdose remains a critical global health issue, often driven by misuse
of opioids, painkillers, and psychiatric medications. Traditional research
methods face limitations, whereas social media offers real-time insights into
self-reported substance use and overdose symptoms. This study proposes an
AI-driven NLP framework trained on annotated social media data to detect
commonly used drugs and associated overdose symptoms. Using a hybrid annotation
strategy with LLMs and human annotators, we applied traditional ML models,
neural networks, and advanced transformer-based models. Our framework achieved
98% accuracy in multi-class and 97% in multi-label classification,
outperforming baseline models by up to 8%. These findings highlight the

Abstract: Validating Large Language Models with ReLM explores the application of formal
languages to evaluate and control Large Language Models (LLMs) for
memorization, bias, and zero-shot performance. Current approaches for
evaluating these types behavior are often slow, imprecise, costly, or introduce
biases of their own, but are necessary due to the importance of this behavior
when productionizing LLMs. This project reproduces key results from the
original ReLM paper and expounds on the approach and applications with an
emphasis on the relevance to the field of systems for machine learning.

application of methods curing similarity negativity leads to accuracy
improvement for both combinatorial and normalized Laplacian based GSC. It also
leads to applicability for GloVe embeddings of explanation methods developed

TL;DR: 论文主张为LLM训练数据生产者提供补偿，估算64个LLM的数据生产成本远超模型训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练数据背后的人力劳动常被忽视且未获补偿，论文旨在量化这一劳动价值并推动公平实践。

Method: 研究2016-2024年发布的64个LLM，估算从零生产训练数据的人力成本。

Result: 数据生产成本是模型训练成本的10-1000倍，凸显LLM提供者的财务负担。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究推动更公平的数据生产补偿机制。

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly
expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and
engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the
human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an
unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words
sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This
position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that
the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided
to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study
64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay
people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly
conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training
datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models
themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.
In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack
of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions
that could enable fairer practices in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解预训练数据如何影响语言模型的表示，特别是线性表示的形成因素。

Result: 线性表示与数据频率高度相关，回归模型能有效预测预训练数据频率。

Conclusion: 线性表示强度可反映预训练数据特性，为优化模型行为提供新思路。

Abstract: Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language
models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this
relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on
downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM
representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some
concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause
these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data
frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find
evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to
pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact
triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning
accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.
This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we
discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms
when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k
times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during
pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear
representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term
was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a
different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method
for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data
models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains
signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for
controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the
models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

Motivation: 现有自动谬误检测数据集多限于正式语言领域，而在线论坛语言多样且非标准化，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出SLURG方法，使用DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B大语言模型生成合成谬误论坛评论。

Result: 大语言模型能复制真实数据的句法模式，高质量少样本提示可增强其模仿论坛词汇多样性的能力。

Conclusion: SLURG方法有效填补了在线论坛谬误检测的空白，展示了LLMs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: In our paper we explore the definition, and extrapolation of fallacies as
they pertain to the automatic detection of manipulation on social media. In
particular we explore how these logical fallacies might appear in the real
world i.e internet forums. We discovered a prevalence of misinformation /
misguided intention in discussion boards specifically centered around the
Ukrainian Russian Conflict which serves to narrow the domain of our task.
Although automatic fallacy detection has gained attention recently, most
datasets use unregulated fallacy taxonomies or are limited to formal linguistic
domains like political debates or news reports. Online discourse, however,
often features non-standardized and diverse language not captured in these
domains. We present Shady Linguistic Utterance Replication-Generation (SLURG)
to address these limitations, exploring the feasibility of generating synthetic
fallacious forum-style comments using large language models (LLMs),
specifically DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B. Our findings indicate that LLMs can
replicate the syntactic patterns of real data} and that high-quality few-shot
prompts enhance LLMs' ability to mimic the vocabulary diversity of online
forums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本属性图（TAGs）中语义丰富性和结构依赖性的双重挑战，弥补GNN和LLM各自的不足。

Method: 提出BiGTex架构，通过堆叠的图文本融合单元实现双向信息流动，使用LoRA进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实现节点分类和链接预测的SOTA性能，消融实验验证了双向注意力和软提示的重要性。

Conclusion: BiGTex通过双向融合GNN和LLM，为文本属性图的表示学习提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation
learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of
node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph
neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the
capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs)
are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph
structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel
architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text
Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and
structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions,
text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The
proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA),
keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves
state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively
to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft
prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Conclusion: 新方法在特定场景中具有实用价值，为优化下游任务的预训练方案提供了更高效的设计途径。

Abstract: While metrics available during pre-training, such as perplexity, correlate
well with model performance at scaling-laws studies, their predictive
capacities at a fixed model size remain unclear, hindering effective model
selection and development. To address this gap, we formulate the task of
selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning
performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs,
differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants
with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or
data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct
a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading
indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy
metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative
performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity
of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training
schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly in demand in both
clinical research and operational practice. However, most of the
state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high
computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP
framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining
accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study
involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1
billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision
of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP
approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data
methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single
machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid
NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art
methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational
resources.

Abstract: Working with documents is a key part of almost any knowledge work, from
contextualizing research in a literature review to reviewing legal precedent.
Recently, as their capabilities have expanded, primarily text-based NLP systems
have often been billed as able to assist or even automate this kind of work.
But to what extent are these systems able to model these tasks as experts
conceptualize and perform them now? In this study, we interview sixteen domain
experts across two domains to understand their processes of document research,
and compare it to the current state of NLP systems. We find that our
participants processes are idiosyncratic, iterative, and rely extensively on
the social context of a document in addition its content; existing approaches
in NLP and adjacent fields that explicitly center the document as an object,
rather than as merely a container for text, tend to better reflect our
participants' priorities, though they are often less accessible outside their
research communities. We call on the NLP community to more carefully consider
the role of the document in building useful tools that are accessible,
personalizable, iterative, and socially aware.

TL;DR: 研究发现，偏好调优技术（如RLHF、DPO）虽减少词汇和句法多样性，但提高了有效语义多样性，因为其生成更多高质量输出。小模型在固定采样预算下更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决偏好调优技术减少多样性的问题，提出有效语义多样性框架以更实用地评估LLM输出。

Method: 通过无需人工干预的开放式任务，比较偏好调优模型（如RLHF、DPO）与SFT或基础模型在多样性和质量上的表现。

Result: 偏好调优模型在语义多样性上表现更好，但句法多样性降低；小模型在生成独特内容上更高效。

Conclusion: 偏好调优在保持语义多样性的同时减少句法多样性，小模型更具参数效率，对需要高质量多样输出的应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including
Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO,
as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given
that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs.
To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic
diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better
reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using
open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive
results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via
RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater
effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing
diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality
outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity
while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity
in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our
analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more
parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling
budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and
diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that
require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic
data generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出知识更新平台（KUP）和记忆条件训练（MCT）方法，用于解决大语言模型（LLMs）知识更新的挑战。KUP提供自动化的知识更新评估框架，MCT通过记忆标记提升模型对新知识的记忆和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注实体替换，无法全面反映复杂现实动态，因此需要更有效的知识更新方法。

Method: 引入KUP作为知识更新评估框架，并提出MCT方法，通过在训练中条件化记忆标记来增强模型对新知识的记忆和推理。

Result: KUP基准测试显示现有方法在推理任务上表现较差（<2%），而MCT在记忆任务上比基线方法提升25.4%。

Conclusion: KUP和MCT为LLMs的知识更新提供了有效工具，显著提升了模型对新知识的处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in
their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a
challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity
substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an
automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an
evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect
probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for
any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called
memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus
on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs
to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results
on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the
best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and
(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)
baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了从LLMs（如Llama 3 70B）中提取整本书的可能性，发现通过“前缀提示”技术可以高相似度地重构《爱丽丝梦游仙境》等书籍，但成功率与书籍的流行度相关。同时，研究发现指令调优后的Llama 3.1的缓解措施失效，且这种失效源于少数权重的微小变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs对训练数据中书籍内容的记忆能力，以及当前缓解策略的局限性。

Method: 使用Llama 3 70B模型和“前缀提示”技术，尝试从少量初始标记中重构整本书。

Result: 成功高相似度重构部分书籍（如《爱丽丝梦游仙境》），但提取率与书籍流行度相关；指令调优后的Llama 3.1缓解措施失效。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的书籍提取能力有限且受数据流行度影响，缓解策略存在局限性，需进一步研究微调对记忆提取的影响。

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B
family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able
to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one
entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.
We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,
piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We
show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,
likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama
3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this
undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated
primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the
limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework
for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in
aligned LLMs.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估框架未充分考虑波斯语言和文化的独特性，导致评估结果不够准确。

Method: 通过翻译现有数据集（如Anthropic Red Teaming）、生成合成数据（如ProhibiBench-fa）和自然收集数据（如GuardBench-fa），构建了三种波斯语基准数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架为波斯语LLM的伦理对齐提供了文化基础的新方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for aligning Persian
Large Language Models (LLMs) with critical ethical dimensions, including
safety, fairness, and social norms. It addresses the gaps in existing LLM
evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural
contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks:
(i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new
naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench,
HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create
ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets
to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we
collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms.
By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for
evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded
alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed
across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness
(mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted
behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian
LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at:

Motivation: 现有RAG框架依赖语义相似性检索，难以区分真实因果关系与虚假关联，导致不完整或误导性回答。

Method: CDF-RAG通过迭代查询优化、检索结构化因果图和多跳因果推理，验证因果路径以确保逻辑一致。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，CDF-RAG显著提升了回答准确性和因果正确性。

Conclusion: CDF-RAG为知识密集型任务提供了更可靠、可解释的生成式推理框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced large
language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external
knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks primarily rely on
semantic similarity and correlation-driven retrieval, limiting their ability to
distinguish true causal relationships from spurious associations. This results
in responses that may be factually grounded but fail to establish
cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. To
address this issue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improve
causal consistency, factual accuracy, and explainability in generative
reasoning. CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves structured causal
graphs, and enables multi-hop causal reasoning across interconnected knowledge
sources. Additionally, it validates responses against causal pathways, ensuring
logically coherent and factually grounded outputs. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four
diverse datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve response accuracy and
causal correctness over existing RAG-based methods. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/ elakhatibi/CDF-RAG.

Motivation: 探讨如何利用合成数据提升小语言模型在特定领域的适应性，解决合成数据多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出MetaSynth方法，通过元提示协调多个专家LLM代理协作生成多样化合成数据。

Result: 仅用2500万标记的合成数据，MetaSynth使Mistral-7B在金融和生物医学领域性能分别提升4.08%和13.75%。

Conclusion: MetaSynth生成的多样化合成数据能有效支持领域适配，无需混合真实数据。

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data
generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging
synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.
A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts
its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we
propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances
diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple
"expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million
tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a
well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and
Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in
general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data
using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM
pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms
the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in
Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data
generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior
generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest
that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real
data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在某些确定性任务中表现不佳，但通过干预可以改善其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在确定性任务中表现不佳，因其隐式先验分布影响了响应。

Method: 通过提示和机制解释技术定位并调整先验影响，轻量微调特定网络层。

Result: 干预显著提升了性能，且微调后错误不再与先验相关。

Conclusion: 研究为减少LLMs依赖先验提供了有效方法，可能减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to
deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the
implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens
influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,
LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,
and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this
information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting
the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic
improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability
techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to
which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is
possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate
with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of
these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high
performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information
required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations
of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning
is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error
after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent
to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially
increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons
related to the prior probability of token sequences.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估MLLMs在几何问题解决（GPS）中的视觉理解和符号推理能力，GeoSense填补了这一空白。

Method: GeoSense包含五级几何原理层次框架、1,789个标注问题和创新评估策略，用于测试多种MLLMs。

Result: Gemini-2.0-pro-flash表现最佳，总分65.3，但几何原理识别和应用仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoSense有助于推动MLLMs几何推理能力的进步，实现更接近人类的AI推理。

Abstract: Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual
comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong
reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive
application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing
benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric
reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their
ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first
comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric
principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric
principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset
of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive
experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we
observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of
$65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application
of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly
hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's
potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning
capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLMs）能否捕捉个体层面的主观性，尤其是在社交媒体用户文本中表现出的价值冲突与道德判断。

Method: 提出SOLAR框架，通过观察用户生成文本中的价值冲突与权衡，抽象出个体的主观价值偏好。

Result: 实验表明SOLAR提升了推断结果的准确性，尤其在争议性情境中表现更优，并能解释个体的价值偏好。

Conclusion: SOLAR框架有效建模个体主观性，为理解用户道德判断提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems
but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective
decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be
subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account
for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this
paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer
their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective
Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in
the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals.
Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as
well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively
show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences,
which can further account for their judgments.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在长上下文推理中的困难，包括计算复杂度的二次增长和长上下文数据标注的稀缺与昂贵问题。

Method: 采用逐步旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）缩放训练策略，生成合成数据以扩展上下文窗口。

Result: 模型在1M tokens的上下文长度下，在RULER和InfiniteBench基准测试中表现良好，同时保持通用语言任务的稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长上下文数据稀缺问题，为LLMs的长上下文推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only
due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length
but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data.
There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates
long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset
with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend
the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our
approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by
the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the
scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position
embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with
a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and
InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant
challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring
excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and
additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to
diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge,
a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized
alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters
through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic
preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model
generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge
model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens
whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge,
using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a
scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment,
paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

Motivation: 检索到的文档常包含无关或误导信息，导致抽象压缩模型遗漏关键内容，影响答案准确性。

Result: 实验显示，ACoRN训练的T5-large显著提升EM和F1分数，并在噪声文档多的数据集中表现优异。

Conclusion: ACoRN有效解决了检索噪声问题，提升了压缩模型在实际场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense
query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is
either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect
content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that
abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential
for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion
occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more
fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise
(ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data
augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against
two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased
compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents
and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries
centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our
experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor,
improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve
as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing
documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能学习敏感信息，引发社会和法律问题，现有方法难以在多领域场景中有效移除知识。

Method: GRAIL利用多领域梯度信息区分遗忘与保留范围，并采用自适应参数定位策略。

Result: 实验表明，GRAIL在遗忘效果上与现有方法相当，知识保留能力提升17%。

Conclusion: GRAIL为大规模预训练语言模型中的敏感信息管理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn
sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under
principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from
scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical.
Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address
multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as
privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to
excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we
propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain
unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple
domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope,
and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively
remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.
Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves
unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also
demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the
previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for
effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale
pre-trained language models.

Conclusion: 通过优化数据选择和分词，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code
generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source
and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically
generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to
inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in
order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based
LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset
aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy
effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the
tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes
padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental
results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the
DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%,
surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time
is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases
from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are
observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By
optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves
model performance but also improves training efficiency.

Conclusion: 本文为幻觉现象提供了统一视角和稳健的追踪分析框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that
deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for
diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper
introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and
understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when
dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical
and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers
effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers
encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that
identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across
randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard
attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with
evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified
perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and
analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Pandora的统一结构化知识推理框架，利用Python的Pandas API构建统一知识表示，并与LLM预训练对齐，通过生成文本推理步骤和可执行代码提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有USKR方法依赖任务特定策略或自定义表示，难以实现知识迁移或与LLM先验对齐，限制了性能。

Method: 利用Pandas API构建统一知识表示，使用LLM生成推理步骤和可执行代码，并通过训练示例库促进知识迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Pandora优于现有统一框架，并与任务特定方法竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora通过统一表示和LLM对齐，显著提升了结构化知识推理的性能。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and
knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on
employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which
struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or
align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper
proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage
of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge
representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to
generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.
Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various
SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora}
outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with
task-specific methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语世界中的偏见，而许多边缘群体和低资源语言被忽视。论文旨在填补这一空白，推动更具包容性的语言模型发展。

Method: 研究了23个语言模型对270个边缘群体的偏见，比较了埃及阿拉伯方言与现代标准阿拉伯语对偏见测量的影响。

Result: 发现语言模型对许多边缘群体表现出更高偏见，但阿拉伯语言模型在宗教和种族方面对边缘和主导群体均表现出高偏见。此外，对非二元性别、LGBTQIA+和黑人女性的交叉偏见更高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了扩展偏见研究范围以涵盖更多边缘群体和低资源语言的重要性，并指出了当前偏见指标的局限性。

Abstract: We know that language models (LMs) form biases and stereotypes of minorities,
leading to unfair treatments of members of these groups, thanks to research
mainly in the US and the broader English-speaking world. As the negative
behavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals,
industry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in
LMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have
been overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to
individual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but
crucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN
estimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members
of marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to
develop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our
understanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource
languages and dialects.
  In this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating
offensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt,
the remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of
bias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we
measure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus
Modern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against
many marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups. However, this is not
the case for Arabic LMs, where the bias is high against both marginalized and
dominant groups in relation to religion and ethnicity.
  Our results also show higher intersectional bias against Non-binary, LGBTQIA+
and Black women.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在几何问题求解（GPS）中缺乏分步解答数据和推理过程中严重幻觉的问题。

Method: 提出GeoGen流程生成分步推理路径，并训练GeoLogic模型结合自然语言与符号系统验证MLLM输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了MLLMs在几何推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLMs和符号系统的优势，实现了更可靠和可解释的几何问题求解方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal
mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving
(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data
and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a
pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for
geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,
\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To
further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train
\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated
by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,
GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the
reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,
achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This
improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic
systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS
task. Codes are available at https://github.com/ycpNotFound/GeoGen.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在艺术评论和心智理论（ToM）任务中的表现，发现通过精心设计的提示，LLM能生成接近人类水平的评论，并在复杂情境中展现一定推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在艺术相关任务中的表现，尤其是评论生成和心智理论推理，以评估其认知潜力与局限性。

Method: 结合艺术批评理论构建系统，生成评论并进行图灵测试；设计新的ToM任务测试41种LLM。

Result: LLM生成的评论在风格和解释上接近人类；ToM任务表现因模型和任务复杂度而异。

Conclusion: LLM在特定条件下能表现出类似理解的行为，但仍受认知限制。

Abstract: This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas
related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states
(Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation
part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with
a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first
write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a
step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared
with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many
cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results
suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style
but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the
second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving
interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of
art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,
socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that
their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that
involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer
differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to
complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations
and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called
Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output
without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are
instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin
to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might
assume.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型性能优化，缺乏对内部机制的理解，且依赖复杂预处理，导致系统不透明。

Method: SMARTe通过槽位注意力机制将任务建模为集合预测问题，确保预测可追溯至槽位表示和贡献的token。

Result: 在NYT和WebNLG数据集上，SMARTe在保持性能的同时提供了可解释性，并通过注意力热图展示解释。

Conclusion: SMARTe证明了可解释性与性能可兼顾，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing
model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms
driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to
induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not
fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations,
we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple
extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot
attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot
attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all
predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the
tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing
interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding
interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted
qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using
attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a
discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.

TL;DR: MLRBench是一个新的多语言长上下文推理基准测试，超越现有基于检索的测试，评估多跳推理、聚合和认知推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于检索能力评估，易受数据泄漏和短路径问题影响，无法全面衡量模型的长上下文推理能力。

Method: 提出MLRBench，包含多语言任务，设计为并行、抗泄漏且可扩展，覆盖七种语言。

Result: 实验显示高低资源语言间存在显著差距，LLMs在多语言环境下仅利用不到30%的宣称上下文长度。

Conclusion: MLRBench开源以促进多语言LLMs的评估和训练研究，现有检索增强生成方法未能完全解决长上下文问题。

Abstract: Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular
needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate
specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a
retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful
recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended
contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,
short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To
address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for
multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes
beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop
inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,
MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to
arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large
language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource
languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple
facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual
settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context
length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate
this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We
open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and
training of multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 视频内容作为传播和虚假信息的媒介日益重要，但现有虚假信息检测主要针对文本，缺乏对视频转录中口语复杂性的处理。

Method: 构建ViClaim数据集，包含1,798个标注视频转录，涵盖三种语言和六个主题，开发定制标注工具，并测试多语言模型的性能。

Result: 模型在交叉验证中表现良好（宏F1达0.896），但在未见主题的泛化上存在困难。

Conclusion: ViClaim为视频虚假信息检测提供了坚实基础，凸显了视频转录中声明检测的复杂性。

Abstract: The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and
misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze
claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in
misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant
gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We
introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three
languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the
transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy,
fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to
facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with
state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in
cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization
to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the
complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust
foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication,
addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents
as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in
machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and
analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on
how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent
systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,
which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured
manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high
accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate
the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study
in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized
AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and
(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the
potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual
awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent
systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent
applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and
shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）在推理时可能捕捉数据集偏差，导致泛化能力不足，而传统的去偏方法效果有限。

Method: 结合因果机制与信息理论，提出IGCIDB框架，通过信息增益引导的因果干预平衡数据集分布，再进行监督微调。

Result: 实验表明IGCIDB能有效去偏，提升LLMs在不同任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IGCIDF框架为解决LLMs的偏差问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large
language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during
inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the
diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression
based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior
knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic
debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the
combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an
information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This
framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method
to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of
instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised
fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results
show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability
across different tasks.

Conclusion: NaVAB为评估和改善LLM与国家价值观对齐提供了实用工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) hold positions that conflict with your
country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus
on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which
encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current
benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires
are not easily scalable.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark
to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China,
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a
national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment
datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction
tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter
value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction
mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on
various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting
in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that
NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value
concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

Result: 实验表明，基于MAIN框架调优的模型（如LLaMA和Mistral）在多个基准测试中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 指令与响应的对齐对实现可扩展且高质量的指令调优至关重要，MAIN框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve
remarkable performance, but its success heavily depends on the availability of
large-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, current methods
for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment
between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that high-quality
instruction-response pairs are not defined by the individual quality of each
component, but by the extent of their alignment with each other. To address
this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) that ensures coherence
between the instruction and response through mutual constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that models such as LLaMA and Mistral, fine-tuned within this
framework, outperform traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. This
approach underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in
enabling scalable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了复杂策略必然更好的假设，展示了简单方法的高效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the
development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable
performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has
spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A
recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs
through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies
require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and
correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In
this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an
embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks
by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect
answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not
require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the
refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches
often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the
benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs.
By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning
strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights
into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So,
are retrials all you need?

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context reasoning abilities of language models led to
interesting applications in large-scale multi-document summarization. However,
prior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their
claimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an
efficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly
sensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a
hybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context
windows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the
optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and
dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LLMs to
generate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to
estimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our
results on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of
our method across model classes and sizes. We compare against length estimates
from strong long-context benchmarks such as RULER and HELMET. Our analysis also
highlights the effectiveness of our estimation method for very long-context LMs
and its generalization to new classes of LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在生成新颖且可行的科学假设方面存在不足，缺乏专门的数据集。

Method: 提出HypoGen数据集，包含5500个结构化问题-假设对，采用Bit-Flip-Spark框架和Chain-of-Reasoning，将假设生成建模为条件语言生成任务。

Result: 实验表明，基于HypoGen微调的模型在假设的新颖性、可行性和整体质量上有所提升。

Conclusion: HypoGen数据集为科学假设生成任务提供了有效支持，推动了AI在科学创新中的应用。

Abstract: Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in
achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models
have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation
of scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often
struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One
reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis
Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we
introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured
problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences
structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional
assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is
the resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit
Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to
Flip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language
modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the
Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to
improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs
automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We
show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty,
feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen
dataset is publicly available at
huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识冲突中的表现，提出了一种新框架Swin-VIB，通过变分信息瓶颈模型优化检索信息，提升响应生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在信息检索系统中面临内部记忆与外部检索信息之间的知识冲突，导致响应不可靠和决策不确定性。

Method: 从信息论角度分析LLMs如何处理知识冲突，提出Swin-VIB框架，结合变分信息瓶颈模型自适应增强检索信息并指导LLM偏好。

Result: 实验表明，Swin-VIB在单选择、开放式问答和检索增强生成任务中显著提升性能，单选择任务准确率至少提高7.54%。

Conclusion: Swin-VIB有效解决了LLMs的知识冲突问题，提升了响应生成的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

Motivation: 解决LLM在训练过程中记忆敏感信息的问题，避免公开部署时的隐私风险。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）通过因果追踪实验识别关键层（0-5层）；2）冻结上层，对下层应用联合损失函数进行优化。

Result: 在SemEval-2025 Task 4中取得第二名，保持88%的基线MMLU准确率。

Conclusion: 因果导向的分层优化为LLM的高效精确遗忘提供了新范式，显著提升了AI系统的数据隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during
training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current
machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data
associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents
our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a
two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with
layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on
OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the
first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute
associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a
constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a
novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set
loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set
deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the
1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of
baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer
optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs,
offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在病理学中因依赖公开数据集的有限信息而缺乏对临床上下文的全面理解，开发WSI级模型具有重要应用价值。

Method: 使用TCGA的10,094对WSI和病理报告构建检索式数据生成流程，并设计基于AI的评估协议验证模型能力。

Result: 模型在1,134对WSI和报告中诊断接受率达62.9%，能够理解多种癌症类型的WSI和临床上下文。

Conclusion: ChatEXAONEPath通过整合多模态数据，有望辅助临床医生全面理解复杂病理形态，提升癌症诊断能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language
models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions
and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical
scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various
modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex
clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies
have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer
questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical
context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public
datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the
scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we
introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as
ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using
10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive
understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and
evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We
demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using
ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and
reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context
from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential
to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of
WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.

Conclusion: 该框架在性能和标记限制缓解方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific
aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of
traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have
shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely
excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination
challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization:
Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely
on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven
retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach
extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby
mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes
token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model
generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves
superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation
problem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，深度学习模型在技术准确性上表现更好，但与领域专家的共识较低；而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然准确性较低，却更符合专家判断。专家共识模型更依赖上下文和时间线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型准确性与专家共识之间的关系，为安全关键NLP应用提供更全面的模型评估框架。

Method: 评估五种DL模型和四种LLMs，使用Cohen's Kappa、PCA和SHAP技术量化模型与专家的共识。

Result: 技术准确性高的模型与专家共识较低，LLMs更符合专家判断。专家共识模型依赖上下文和时间线索。

Conclusion: 准确性不足以评估安全关键NLP模型，需结合专家共识。LLMs在可解释性和扩展性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between deep learning (DL) model
accuracy and expert agreement in the classification of crash narratives. We
evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and
narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models
(LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive
trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with
domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite
relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert
agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned
models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than
location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is
insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We
advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model
evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable,
scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理模糊查询、冲突信息和噪声时往往孤立解决单一问题，缺乏综合方法。

Method: 提出RAMDocs数据集模拟复杂冲突场景，并设计MADAM-RAG多代理方法，通过多轮辩论整合有效答案并剔除错误信息。

Result: MADAM-RAG在AmbigDocs和FaithEval上分别提升11.40%和15.80%的性能，但RAMDocs对现有基线仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: MADAM-RAG初步解决了多源冲突问题，但在证据不平衡时仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their
responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous
user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant
documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in
isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or
robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors
simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and
Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and
realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including
ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent
approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple
rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to
disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby
handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which
requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over
strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires
suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with
Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for
existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match
score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our
analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing
the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

Result: 实验表明EBRM在鲁棒性和泛化性上显著提升，安全关键任务对齐效果提高5.97%。

Conclusion: EBRM是一种可扩展且有效的奖励模型增强方法，适用于现有对齐流程。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex
human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges,
we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc
refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM
models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human
preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It
achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware
contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs
without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across
different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate
significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to
a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard
RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined
rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These
results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for
existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Motivation: 许多语言模型应用需要生成符合语法或语义约束的文本，但直接从约束后的分布中生成通常是难以处理的。

Method: 采用序贯蒙特卡罗（SMC）框架，动态结合约束并优化计算资源分配。

Result: 在多个领域（如Python代码生成、文本到SQL等）的实验显示，该方法显著提升小型模型的性能。

Conclusion: SMC方法有效近似后验分布，为控制生成问题提供了简单可编程的解决方案。

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution
-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for
controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC
framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific
constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational
resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By
comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains
-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and
molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach
allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,
as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic
perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better
approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework
of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic
programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a
broad variety of controlled generation problems.

TL;DR: CLIMB是一种自动化的预训练数据混合优化框架，通过语义聚类和迭代搜索提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据集通常缺乏明确的领域划分，手动标注成本高，因此需要一种自动化方法来优化数据混合。

Method: CLIMB通过语义嵌入和聚类大规模数据集，利用代理模型和预测器迭代搜索最优数据混合。

Result: 在400B tokens上训练后，1B模型性能超过Llama-3.2-1B 2.0%，特定领域优化提升5%。

Conclusion: CLIMB框架有效优化预训练数据混合，并提供了ClimbLab和ClimbMix数据集供研究使用。

Abstract: Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack
inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl
do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets
such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal
pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its
significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,
we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an
automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a
pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale
datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures
using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B
tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art
Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific
domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.
Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20
clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful
400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers
superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data
mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data

Motivation: 为2型糖尿病治疗提供精确、结构化、数据支持的临床指南。

Method: 使用机器学习优化数据，训练树模型并手动组合成端到端处方流程，优先考虑更积极的治疗。

Result: 在未见过的BMC患者中，HbA1c中位数降低比医生高0.26%；在外部数据集中高0.13%。

Conclusion: 该方法精确、可解释且高效，预计能超越当前实践并改善患者结果。

Abstract: Objective: Create precise, structured, data-backed guidelines for type 2
diabetes treatment progression, suitable for clinical adoption.
  Research Design and Methods: Our training cohort was composed of patient
(with type 2 diabetes) visits from Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1998 to
2014. We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen
before the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the
recommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational
data, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more
aggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove
some datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On
each subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment
changes. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for
every group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in
that group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive
treatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline
on unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type
2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).
  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more
than what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford
cohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.
  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to
treatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current
practice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent
system designed to enhance human-machine collaboration in Machine Learning

that integrates specialized agents to create and manage ML workflows through
natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular
design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline
orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented

iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables
users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML
pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation,
all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the
accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML
tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other
platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and
demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and
lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了开放世界中智能体如何应对超出其设计范围的新情境，提出了一种结合元知识和元推理的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界中的智能体常面临超出其经验或知识范围的新情境，且缺乏足够时间评估和应对。需要快速、可靠地识别并适应这些情境。

Method: 提出了一种结合领域通用元知识（受人类认知启发）和元推理的新方法。

Result: 该方法有望为开放世界中的通用智能体提供快速、适应性强的响应。

Conclusion: 结合元知识和元推理的方法能更好地满足开放世界智能体的性能需求。

Abstract: Regardless of past learning, an agent in an open world will face unfamiliar
situations and events outside of prior experience, existing models, or
policies. Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or
sufficient time to assess the situation, generate and evaluate options, and
pursue a robustly considered course of action. How can an agent respond
reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can
it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine
reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed
for solutions, evaluate the state-of-the-art by these requirements, and outline
a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (in the
form of appraisals inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. It has the
potential to provide fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more
fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general
agents.

*Zahra Atf,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI系统的可解释性与用户信任之间存在显著但中等程度的正相关关系，表明可解释性并非唯一或主导因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI可解释性是否真正提升用户信任，并研究其社会技术意义。

Method: 采用元分析方法，综合分析了90项研究的数据。

Result: 可解释性与用户信任呈中等正相关，但非唯一影响因素。

Conclusion: 强调需关注AI系统的长期可信度，而非仅短期信任，并推动公平可持续的AI应用。

Abstract: This study critically examines the commonly held assumption that
explicability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems inherently boosts user
trust. Utilizing a meta-analytical approach, we conducted a comprehensive
examination of the existing literature to explore the relationship between AI
explainability and trust. Our analysis, incorporating data from 90 studies,
reveals a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between
the explainability of AI systems and the trust they engender among users. This
indicates that while explainability contributes to building trust, it is not
the sole or predominant factor in this equation. In addition to academic
contributions to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), this research highlights
its broader socio-technical implications, particularly in promoting
accountability and fostering user trust in critical domains such as healthcare
and justice. By addressing challenges like algorithmic bias and ethical
transparency, the study underscores the need for equitable and sustainable AI
adoption. Rather than focusing solely on immediate trust, we emphasize the
normative importance of fostering authentic and enduring trustworthiness in AI
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroSumEval提出了一种基于零和游戏的动态评估协议，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的能力，克服传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如静态数据集、人工评估）存在过拟合、高成本和偏见问题，需要更动态和全面的评估方式。

Method: 设计了多样化的游戏套件（如PyJail、国际象棋、数学测验等），通过零和游戏动态评估LLMs的战略推理、知识应用等能力。

Result: 实验表明，前沿模型（如GPT、Claude）在常见游戏和问答中表现良好，但在需要创造力和新颖问题的游戏中表现不佳。

Conclusion: ZeroSumEval提供了一个标准化且可扩展的框架，为LLMs的动态评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally
relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based
evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and
biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that
leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist
saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including
security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker),
knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These
games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic
reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon
recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for
LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and
extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments
with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that
while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games
and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel
and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably
jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We
release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.

*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于符号编年史的系统，用于追踪多智能体生成内容的时间维度来源，无需依赖内部状态或外部元信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向多智能体协作发展，生成内容的来源变得复杂且难以追溯，需要一种方法来记录和验证贡献历史。

Method: 提出了一种基于符号编年史的系统，通过时间戳和签名记录生成历史，类似于法医学中的保管链。

Result: 系统通过反馈循环更新交互记录，并在生成过程中同步内容与编年史。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在为协作AI开发一种可追溯的生成历史记录方法，增强其在动态网络生态系统中的问责性。

Abstract: Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental
pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the
flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous
agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of
generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation,
where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a
multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,
often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we
investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal
dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc
attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on
internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the
notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in
a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system
operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the
chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content
in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable
form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练模型如何从视觉观察中获取高级推理能力，尤其是空间关系推理。

Method: 提出Embodied-R框架，结合VLM和LM，通过强化学习（RL）和新型奖励系统（考虑逻辑一致性）训练。

Result: 在5k样本训练后，3B LM的Embodied-R在空间推理任务上匹配SOTA模型（如OpenAI-o1），并展现出系统性分析和上下文整合能力。

Conclusion: Embodied-R证明了小规模模型通过协作框架和RL训练可实现高效推理，并探讨了奖励设计、泛化差异等研究问题。

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential
visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained
models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains
unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining
large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale
Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model
achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After
training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches
state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.
Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis
and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including
response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences
in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络代理研究主要集中在导航和交易任务，缺乏对大规模结构化数据提取的关注。

Method: 提出BardeenAgent框架，将代理执行转化为可重复程序，并利用HTML结构生成通用CSS选择器以提取数据。

Result: BardeenAgent在WebLists基准测试中达到66%召回率，性能提升显著且成本降低。

Conclusion: BardeenAgent通过创新方法解决了数据提取的挑战，为网络代理研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction
tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present
WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business
and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,
configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined
schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents
struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite
higher performance on question-answering tasks.
  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that
enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and
replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also
the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In
particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all
relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.
  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more
than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output
row by 3x.

TL;DR: InstructRAG提出了一种结合检索增强生成和多智能体元强化学习的新方法，用于解决任务规划中的可扩展性和迁移性问题，实验显示性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于TAO过程的方法受限于LLMs对复杂任务知识的不足，而RAG提供了利用外部数据库的机会，但在任务规划中存在可扩展性和迁移性挑战。

Method: 提出InstructRAG，包含组织历史指令路径的图结构、用于扩展覆盖的RL-Agent和提升任务泛化的ML-Agent，两者端到端训练。

Result: 在四个任务规划数据集上，InstructRAG性能显著提升，最高比现有方法提高19.2%。

Conclusion: InstructRAG通过多智能体框架有效解决了RAG在任务规划中的挑战，提升了性能和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as
agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a
thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these
approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex
tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by
leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In
this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)
in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution
within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these
challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths
(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to
expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to
improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained
end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four
widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly
enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a
19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.

TL;DR: EEF方法通过利用专家失败轨迹中的有益动作，显著提升了LLM在复杂子任务中的表现，优于RFT和GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RFT方法在复杂子任务中表现不佳，专家失败轨迹中的有用信息未被充分利用。

Method: 提出EEF方法，从专家失败轨迹中提取有益动作并整合到训练数据中，排除有害动作。

Result: EEF在WebShop中达到62%胜率，优于RFT（53.6%）和GPT-4（35.6%），并在多个任务中创下新记录。

Conclusion: EEF通过利用专家失败信息，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents,
excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions.
Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for
finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful
trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning
on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g.,
GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler
scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently
out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we
discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide
valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve
agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which
identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates
them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously
excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging
the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some
previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance.
Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT
(53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new
state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and
exceed 81 in SciWorld.

Motivation: 前沿模型生成的推理轨迹可能被用于模型蒸馏，模型所有者需要一种方法在不影响性能的情况下限制蒸馏效果。

Method: 采用抗蒸馏采样策略，通过策略性地修改模型的下一词概率分布，破坏推理轨迹的可用性。

Result: 抗蒸馏采样成功降低了推理轨迹对蒸馏的有效性，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Conclusion: 抗蒸馏采样是一种有效的方法，可以在不损害模型性能的前提下防止模型蒸馏。

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
\emph{Antidistillation sampling} provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important

idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“睡眠时间计算”的方法，通过离线预计算用户可能提出的查询，显著减少测试时的计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在测试时高延迟和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 引入睡眠时间计算，预计算用户可能提出的查询和有用量，并在两个推理任务（Stateful GSM-Symbolic 和 Stateful AIME）上验证其效果。

Result: 睡眠时间计算可将测试时计算需求减少约5倍，并通过扩展睡眠时间计算将准确性提高13%（Stateful GSM-Symbolic）和18%（Stateful AIME）。

Conclusion: 睡眠时间计算能有效减少计算成本并提高准确性，尤其在用户查询可预测时效果更显著。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency
and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to
"think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating
what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can
significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -
Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can
reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~
5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time
compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic
and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,
which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context.
By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context
using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by
2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute
is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well
correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a
case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

Motivation: 尽管MoE LLMs在多任务适应性上表现优异，但专家间的协作机制尚不明确，限制了模型的可解释性和优化潜力。

Method: 采用分层稀疏字典学习（HSDL）分析专家协作模式，并提出贡献感知专家剪枝（CAEP）算法优化模型。

Result: 实验发现协作模式与输入类型相关，CAEP算法平均提升性能2.5%。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE LLMs的效率和可解释性提供了新见解，优化了专家交互的理解和模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown
significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to
specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among
experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and
optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues:
(1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs
through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical
sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration
patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the
Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes
low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert
collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit
semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show
that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average,
outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into
enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer
understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

Motivation: 解决在多轮设置中切换LoRA时需要重新计算整个历史记录的KV缓存的问题。

Method: 修改LoRA框架，仅对调用aLoRA后的令牌进行权重适配，保留基础模型的KV缓存。

Result: aLoRA在保持与标准LoRA竞争性准确度的同时，显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: aLoRA为构建高度专业化的模型（intrinsics）提供了高效解决方案，适用于多轮对话场景。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for
finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to
method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly
customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a
multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the
entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation
can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which
modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the
sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA
to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can
be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the
cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly
specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an
input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We
use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive
accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge
in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each
potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces
complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing
multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose
a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of
the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to
have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby
allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the
objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search
or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its
advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective
optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting
scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are
scarce.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across
industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language
processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its
rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust
and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches
to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable
symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks
(FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the
operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The
derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several
examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic
paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify
symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships.
The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across
network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision
tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision
processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative
refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras
.h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This
prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations
from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting
accountability.

Motivation: 探索Moran特征向量作为空间特征在机器学习模型中的效果，特别是在处理空间变化和非线性效应时。

Method: 生成合成数据集，测试不同空间权重矩阵的Moran特征向量，评估多种机器学习模型的性能，并与仅使用坐标的模型对比。

Result: 仅使用坐标的机器学习模型在多数情况下表现更好，但在负空间自相关或网络自相关情况下，Moran特征向量仍具优势。

Conclusion: Moran特征向量在特定空间自相关情况下仍有用，但需根据具体问题选择方法。

Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in
accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to
machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran
Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We
generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying
and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors
calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori
eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine
learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and
benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models
that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and
functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true
processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location
coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across
various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these
findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial
autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network
autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran
Eigenvectors would still be useful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，机器学习中的公平性问题日益重要，需要避免模型对边缘化群体的不利预测。

Method: 扩展梯度提升方法，引入最小-最大公平性项，通过原始-对偶问题优化目标函数。

Result: 理论证明算法在温和条件下收敛，实验显示其在二元和子群公平性问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是一种强大且灵活的公平性优化框架，适用于多种公平性概念。

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical
concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have
disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to
mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such
as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice
concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning
problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a
broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such
as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We
study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max
optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual
problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to
diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting
algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and
empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and
subgroup fairness.

TL;DR: Default MoE方法通过稀疏激活参数但密集梯度更新，解决了MoE训练中的不稳定性和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE)预训练虽然可扩展性强，但稀疏更新导致训练不稳定和性能不佳。

Method: 提出Default MoE方法，用专家输出的指数移动平均替代缺失的激活，使路由器接收所有专家的信号。

Result: Default MoE在多种设置下优于标准TopK路由，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: Default MoE显著提升了训练性能，无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer
pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their
feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse
backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We
present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense
gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our
method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert
activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of
expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the
router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to
significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms
standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant
computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Result: 证明了生成的数据集足够通用，能确保Transformer学习多样化的Gröbner基，并提出了增强训练效果的扩展算法。

Conclusion: 为Transformer解决数学问题提供了严格的几何基础，支持多样化输入训练的理念。

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid
progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They
demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving
mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific
datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using
Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based
Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical
guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In
this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed
algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers
can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose
an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of
ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer.
Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address
a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of
training on diverse or representative inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为D2FT的分布式动态微调框架，通过选择性操作注意力模块和优化策略，显著降低了计算和通信成本，同时保持较高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型规模迅速增大，传统微调方法在商业设备上难以满足内存带宽需求，且计算成本高、负载不均衡。

Method: D2FT框架通过三种创新选择策略，动态优化注意力模块的操作，并结合多背包优化解决负载不均衡问题。

Result: 实验显示，D2FT将训练计算成本降低40%，通信成本降低50%，准确性仅下降1%-2%。D2FT还可扩展至LoRA技术。

Conclusion: D2FT是一种高效且可扩展的微调框架，显著降低了资源消耗，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with
minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation
models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model
fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory
bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this
issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory
requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their
foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high
computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations
across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention
modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning
foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT
significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning
foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in
distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via
multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and
training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show
that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost
or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on
Stanford Cars dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程问题中机器学习模型需要适应新数据但计算成本高，持续学习能避免灾难性遗忘并提升效率。

Method: 在五个工程数据集上应用多种CL方法，构建了九个新基准测试，评估其性能。

Result: Replay策略在多个基准测试中表现接近完全重新训练，同时减少近一半训练时间。

Conclusion: 持续学习在工程设计中具有潜力，Replay策略尤其适合实际工作流程。

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve
computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering
data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new
knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models
from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work
introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on
representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering
datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their
ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results
show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over
naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance
comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by
nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

TL;DR: MOM是一种高效内存的推理方法，通过将关键层分割为“mini-sequences”并结合KV缓存卸载，显著减少GPU内存需求。实验表明，MOM平均降低峰值内存50%以上，并在保持输出准确性的同时扩展上下文长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文语言模型在推理时GPU内存需求高，难以部署。

Method: 提出MOM方法，将关键层分割为“mini-sequences”，结合KV缓存卸载。

Result: MOM平均降低峰值内存50%以上，扩展上下文长度（如从155k到455k），保持输出准确性，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: MOM解决了推理中的内存瓶颈，未来研究方向可转向解码阶段KV缓存效率优化。

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain
challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We
propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that
partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates
seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and
Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on
average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k
to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and
not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due
to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared
to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context
length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill
memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory
bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research
priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to
improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

TL;DR: 扩散模型如何泛化到训练集之外尚不明确，本文通过分析去噪分数匹配（DSM）目标中的噪声特性，提出了一种理论解释其泛化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的泛化能力与其训练目标DSM中的噪声特性相关，但具体机制尚不清楚。本文旨在揭示这一现象背后的理论原因。

Method: 利用物理学启发的路径积分方法，分析了几种典型欠参数化和过参数化扩散模型的学习分布。

Result: 发现扩散模型学习到的分布类似于训练分布，但填补了其中的'空白'，这种归纳偏差源于训练中噪声目标的协方差结构。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的泛化能力与其训练目标的噪声特性密切相关，噪声结构填补了训练分布的空白，形成了有效的归纳偏差。

Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and
is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score
matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score
function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn
the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy.
We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its
target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only
equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent
diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory
that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our
theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to
compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and
overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion
models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions,
but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the
covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also
characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive
biases.

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习安全模型，成功解决了安全强化学习中安全约束未知的问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align
the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including
cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires
anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general
setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from
sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety
model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact
on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their
corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory
is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to
demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.
Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and
derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally,
our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is
effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various
continuous control tasks.

Motivation: 洪水是最常见的自然灾害，准确的洪水预测对早期预警系统至关重要。现有机器学习模型依赖全球数据集训练，但国家预报员难以调整模型以适应本地需求，且本地数据对提升性能有价值。

Method: 方法包括在大型全球数据集上预训练模型，然后在单个流域的本地数据上进行微调。

Result: 结果显示，性能提升最显著的是在全球训练中表现不佳的流域，验证了本地数据的额外价值。

Conclusion: 结论是为国家预报员提供了一条利用本地数据掌握全球模型所有权的路径，降低了基于机器学习的洪水预测系统部署的门槛。

Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood
forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown
that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood
predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This
requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national
forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their
region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore,
traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local
data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable
for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a
methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then
fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in
performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra
information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that
performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform
during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish
to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the
barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

Result: 在Atari Pong和Breakout基准测试中，EPO在策略质量和样本效率上优于标准策略梯度和进化计算方法。

Conclusion: EPO为需要探索和局部优化的任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency.
Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained,
gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their
focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel
in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a
hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods
for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and
the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the
exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and
Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy
quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it
effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

Motivation: 解决现有OSSL方法在特征空间中处理OOD样本时的不足，如排除、干扰或过度信任OOD样本。

Method: 采用原型对比学习，通过ID-Selective Magnetic (ISM)模块选择性对齐ID样本，同时允许OOD样本保持未对齐状态，并使用SMA损失动态调整对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MagMatch在闭集分类精度和OOD检测AUROC上显著优于现有方法，尤其是对未见OOD数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MagMatch通过自然隔离OOD样本和选择性对齐ID样本，有效提升了OSSL的性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of
learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and
unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form
suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with
them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we
introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples
through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional
methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it
selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective
Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain
unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective
Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts
alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both
closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in
generalizing to unseen OOD data.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FedDua平均提升全局模型性能3.17%。

Conclusion: FedDua有效解决了数据量不准确问题，提升了联邦学习的模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning
models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client
privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the
performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation
method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client,
which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is
prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data
volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we
propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata
q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It
enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each
client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be
seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model
aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17%
compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate
client data volume declarations.

Conclusion: ChemKANs在燃烧物理和化学动力学中具有潜力，展示了KAN-ODEs在更大规模问题中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion
problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time
scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these
models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy
data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations
(KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications
thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth
activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE
framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the
relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation
loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables
streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating
parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and
outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no
overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models
from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet
struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN
(only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry,
providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is
generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations
indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics,
and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and
more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

Result: 实验表明GroupCART无需数据转换即可实现更公平的模型，且性能下降最小，支持自定义权重。

Conclusion: 通过多任务、公平感知学习，可以减轻决策树模型中的算法偏见。

Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while
satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically
optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result
in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g.,
gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a
tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by
optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for
increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART
achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance
degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering
a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness
based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in
decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware
learning. All code and datasets used in this study are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种简单的Transformer改进方法，使其适用于图学习，避免了复杂的架构改动，并在多个图数据集中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图Transformer架构复杂，难以利用Transformer的训练进展。本文旨在通过简单修改使普通Transformer适用于图学习。

Method: 提出三种改进：(1) 使用简化的L2注意力衡量token的幅度接近性；(2) 自适应均方根归一化保留token幅度信息；(3) 共享编码器的相对位置编码偏置。

Result: 在多种图数据集中表现显著提升，并在图同构测试中展现出较强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 通过简单修改，普通Transformer可有效应用于图学习，且性能优越。

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities,
employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph
Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either
integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention
mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer
training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain
Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major
architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1)
simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2)
adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude
information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder.
Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the
effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation
on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in
the graph isomorphism.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BetaConform框架，通过最大后验估计和自适应停止采样，高效精确地评估LLM集成判断的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM集成判断的准确性评估缺乏高效方法，需要一种经济且精确的估计框架。

Method: 提出混合Beta-Binomial分布模型，引入自适应停止采样和先验转移机制，整合为BetaConform框架。

Result: BetaConform在TruthfulQA数据集上仅需10个样本，误差低至3.37%。

Conclusion: BetaConform为LLM集成判断提供了理论保证的高效性能评估方法。

Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their
accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present
a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise
estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a
mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution,
revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal
prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative
sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior
transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets
to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are
available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our
distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to
deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble
judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated
empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset,
for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error
margin as small as 3.37%.

TL;DR: 研究了条件独立性之间的“元依赖”关系，通过几何直观和信息投影提供了一种简单计算的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限数据可能导致条件独立性与图形性质之间的对应关系失效，需要研究这种“元依赖”关系。

Method: 利用几何直观（将条件独立性约束为流形）和信息投影，提出了一种计算“元依赖”的简单方法。

Result: 通过合成和真实数据验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 信息投影为理解条件独立性之间的“元依赖”提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests
for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These
approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the
graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence
properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and
faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to
the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions,
the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different
conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time.
We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties
using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property
constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The
"meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position
of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a
simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections
and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world
data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于停止时间方法的新分析框架，放宽了SGD收敛分析中的步长条件和假设，证明了在非凸设置下SGD的几乎必然收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SGD收敛分析通常需要严格的Robbins-Monro条件和强假设，而实际应用中步长方案多样，现有结果有限且假设过强。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入停止时间方法的新分析框架，放宽步长条件（如∑ϵ_t=∞且∑ϵ_t^p<∞，p>2），并弱化损失函数的全局Lipschitz连续性和随机梯度高阶矩的有界性假设。

Result: 在非凸设置下证明了SGD的几乎必然收敛性，并进一步建立了L2收敛性。

Conclusion: 本文的理论结果显著放宽了假设，更具普适性，提升了在实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning
research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size
setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a
wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing
convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This
paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a
stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under
more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex
setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $
\{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t =
+\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$.
Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz
continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness
requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon
the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence.
These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more
general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control
gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental
cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput
sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN
inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial

supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze
large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support
both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the
development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive
review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the
datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on
the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing
inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN
inference are also discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在材料发现中表现优异，但对域外数据的预测不可靠且难以识别，亟需解决方案。

Method: 采用Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles（DPOSE）作为高效的不确定性量化方法，并将其集成到SchNet模型中。

Result: DPOSE能有效区分域内和域外样本，对未观测分子和材料类别表现出更高的不确定性。

Conclusion: 轻量级UQ方法（如DPOSE）可提升GNN模型的鲁棒性，并为未来与主动学习策略的结合奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合经典-量子深度学习（HCQ-DL）模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆感知模块在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，并展示了其优于经典深度学习（C-DL）模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗攻击可能导致深度学习模型输出错误分类，对自动驾驶车辆的安全性造成严重影响。因此，研究如何提升模型在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: 使用AlexNet和VGG-16作为特征提取器，结合量子系统构建HCQ-DL模型，并在PGD、FGSA和GA三种对抗攻击下进行测试。

Result: HCQ-DL模型在无攻击场景下准确率超过95%，在FGSA和GA攻击下超过91%，远高于C-DL模型。在PGD攻击下，HCQ-DL模型准确率为85%，而C-DL模型低于21%。

Conclusion: HCQ-DL模型在对抗攻击下表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶车辆的感知模块。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for
autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might
have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks
that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly
classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In
this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning
(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate
robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding
them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and
vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our
HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack
(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted
adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during
adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain
accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA
attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our
alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL
models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the
HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under
adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PU学习中聚类假设的特征选择方法FSCPU，解决了传统方法将未标记数据视为负样本的局限性，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在PU学习任务中，传统特征选择方法可能因忽略正样本的统计特性而导致性能不佳，尤其是在数据形成聚类的情况下。

Method: FSCPU将特征选择问题建模为二元优化任务，目标函数明确结合了PU学习中的聚类假设。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FSCPU在不同数据条件下均表现优异，且在下游分类任务中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: FSCPU是一种有效的特征选择方法，尤其在PU学习场景中，即使聚类假设不完全成立，仍能保持良好性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes
encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few
positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain
real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection
often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature
selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the
statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to
suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection
method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU
formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an
objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in
the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons
with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves
competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the
cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Conclusion: VLMGuard-R1通过推理驱动的提示重写有效提升多模态模型安全性，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to
mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating
vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional
safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to
preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM
safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce
VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a
reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to
deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures
without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a
three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter
to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic
refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal
that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1
achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on
the SIUO benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种驾驶员主观感知风险（DSPR）模型，结合半监督学习策略和CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络，用于预测驾驶员实时风险评分（SRRs），准确率达87.91%。


<details>

Motivation: 驾驶员对风险的感知影响其对自动驾驶系统（ADS）的接受、信任和使用，但现有方法难以评估主观风险。

Method: 通过驾驶员在环实验收集实时SRRs数据，采用CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络和半监督学习策略减少数据噪声。

Result: DSPR模型预测准确率最高（87.91%），半监督策略提升20.12%，CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估驾驶员感知风险提供了有效方法，有助于提升ADS安全性和驾驶员信任。

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of
the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and
difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's
subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as
a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20
participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their
real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic
driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long
short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is
embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to
reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results
illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in
predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The
semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA
network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures.
This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk,
providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust
improvement.

Conclusion: Constrained Learning和MPOCtrL为数据稀缺或高维系统提供了有效的建模工具。

Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by
integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural
network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges
with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN
frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which
could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN
learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation
of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially
observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation
of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message
Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach
tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the
fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github
link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear
dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the
system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL
outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Motivation: 研究持续学习中梯度下降在多任务上的行为，特别是任务顺序对收敛性和遗忘的影响。

Method: 在多线性分类任务上顺序运行梯度下降（GD），分析任务顺序（循环/随机）对收敛性和遗忘的影响。

Result: 任务联合可分时，分类器方向收敛于联合最大间隔解；循环顺序下遗忘量随循环减少；非联合可分时模型收敛于联合损失函数最小值。

Conclusion: 任务顺序和可分性显著影响持续学习的收敛性和遗忘行为，循环顺序有助于减少遗忘并促进知识转移。

Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by
sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per
task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a
cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear
classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising
because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the
individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint
max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions.
Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a
non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1)
alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and
backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero
as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer
jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges
to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently.
However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and
inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The
Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder
extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to
graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical
analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders,
demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture
graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with
vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and
codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based
encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of
training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training
progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer
codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The
second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn
closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in
the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in
self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple
datasets.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)
often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like
linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In
this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key
techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are
frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these
ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce
TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information
compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified
framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating
temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to
capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We
propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain,
supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the
learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule
can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GPMFS证明了个性化特征选择方法的必要性和潜在应用价值，为多标签数据集中的标签特异性提供了新见解。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task
scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent
research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the
major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be
effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,
existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying
global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized
characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This
global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific
discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and
Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly
identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively
supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features
using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining
strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights
into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby
demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature
selection approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DEPOSITUM的去中心化非凸复合联邦学习算法，通过近似全局梯度和动量优化，减少通信成本，理论分析显示其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习依赖中心化架构，且非凸复合优化问题研究不足，需探索去中心化解决方案。

Method: 基于近端随机梯度跟踪，引入动量优化和局部更新，减少数据异质性和通信开销。

Result: DEPOSITUM达到预期ε-稳定点，迭代复杂度为O(1/ε²)，误差以O(1/T)速率下降，支持网络无关线性加速。

Conclusion: DEPOSITUM在真实数据集上验证了有效性，优于其他联邦复合优化算法。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the
server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning,
attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the
objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and
frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms
to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite
optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization
problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite
Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon
proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data
heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The
introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing
tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients.
Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables,
significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an
iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient,
consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate
of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm
achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch
sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on
real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various
hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite
optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Result: 实验和理论表明Sign-In提升了PaI性能，但仍需解决与密集到稀疏训练的差距。

Conclusion: Sign-In是解决稀疏训练中参数符号问题的有效方法，但完全消除性能差距仍是未来挑战。

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch
(PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient
deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on
finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end,
determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to
PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic
reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are
complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish,
rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory
suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open
challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Conclusion: 该方案为从VQNN梯度中高效恢复输入数据提供了可行方法。

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is
characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits.
Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model
gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this
paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input
training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our
scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients
estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering.
The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient
convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even
batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT)
and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing
profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data
using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index.
We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and
sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due
to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our
strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs
hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to
manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has
the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than
the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and
tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12
days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation
decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where
as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period
and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period.
All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss
of 2.2508 %.

Motivation: 在保护隐私的前提下，如何在资源受限的异构设备上实现高效联邦学习是一个挑战。

Method: FedX将全局模型分解为不同子网络，并根据设备资源动态调整量化位数，服务器端完成量化以减少设备计算负担。

Result: 实验表明，FedX显著提升了量化时间、设备计算时间和端到端训练时间，同时保证了模型收敛性。

Conclusion: FedX通过结合模型量化和知识共享，在资源受限设备上实现了高效且实用的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices
without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking.
However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low
computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained
mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes
FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.
To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a
global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized
bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources
receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number
of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization
operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on
devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and
in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization
term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model
quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a
cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX
significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation
time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with
baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically
and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's
optimization efficiency.

Motivation: 类别不平衡数据集在机器学习中是一个重要挑战，SMOTE方法在生成新样本时容易受到噪声和异常值的影响。

Method: iHHO-SMOTe首先使用随机森林进行特征选择，再用DBSCAN检测并移除异常值，最后进行混合过采样。

Conclusion: iHHO-SMOTe通过噪声和异常值处理，显著提升了分类模型的性能，成为解决类别不平衡问题的有力方法。

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine
learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed
among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier
performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses
this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority
class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation
of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses
the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This
process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify
the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers
based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority
classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent
oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive
experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of
the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of
0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently
exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a
formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise
reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Motivation: 研究动机在于发现FL在非IID数据下的潜在漏洞，并开发一种更隐蔽且高效的后门攻击方法。

Result: 实验证明CollaPois在多种数据集上优于现有攻击方法，能规避防御机制，且仅需少数被攻陷客户端即可生效。

Conclusion: CollaPois揭示了FL在非IID数据下的严重安全风险，需开发更强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using
decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness
against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new
vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed
(non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of
model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative
backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a
single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised
clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients,
causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region
centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the
Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data
distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving
its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting
it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable
shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples,
allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL
algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses,
especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions.
Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving
a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is
closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor
infections.

Conclusion: Bird-MAE在专业领域表现优异，原型探测方法缩小了与微调的差距。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the
fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as
bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing
environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its
unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a
domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We
explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen
representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet
downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification
performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally,
we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging
MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear
probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately
3\% on average on BirdSet.

Result: 通过实验验证，动态关闭权重衰减可以改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式正则化与隐式偏置的相互作用对模型泛化至关重要，动态调度策略具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized
models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often
employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been
studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their
interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it
can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate
explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting
effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct
effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical
approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix
sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility
of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight
the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch
off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we
demonstrate in experiments.

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to
novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical
characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing
regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation
of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure,
leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops,
including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation
laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning
behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology
extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired
macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them
to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in
attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular
arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and
theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to

subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial

technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor
recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage
included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to
improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants

Motivation: 传统PINNs的自适应采样方法存在计算效率低的问题，尤其是在高维或高阶导数场景下。

Conclusion: RL-PINNs为高维和高阶问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance
heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional
adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require
multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational
inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient
computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement
learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training
with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling
as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal
training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we
replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient
function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative
calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize
long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments
across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear,
high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs
significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in
accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead,
making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the
exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural
innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to
effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for
improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free
grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy
metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM
have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于GPGPU计算的虚拟机（VM），支持任意位宽的低精度数据类型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）服务需要大量计算资源，现有低精度核生成方法局限于2的幂次位宽且性能不佳。

Method: 设计了一个虚拟机，具有线程块级编程模型、分层内存空间、新颖代数布局系统，并支持多样低精度数据类型。

Result: 实验表明，该VM支持全谱低精度数据类型，性能优于现有低精度核，提升幅度达1.03x至2.61x。

Conclusion: 所提VM在低精度计算中表现出色，为LLM服务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications
but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory
bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged
as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption.
Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight
bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to
high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical
optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory
access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations.
In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose
GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with
arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM
features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a
novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision
data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with
automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision
data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their
supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well
as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves
performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Top-$k$和Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer框架，扩展了传统的单代理延迟决策方法，通过动态选择最优代理数量以提高决策可靠性和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单代理延迟决策，但在高风险场景中需要集体专家知识，因此需要更灵活的框架。

Method: 提出了Top-$k$和Top-$k(x)$框架，前者固定选择k个最自信代理，后者动态学习最优代理数量。

Result: 实验证明该框架在分类和回归任务中有效，且理论证明了其收敛到贝叶斯最优分配。

Conclusion: Top-$k$和Top-$k(x)$框架为高风险场景提供了更灵活和高效的决策支持。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve
reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent
agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent
deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require
collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of
the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most
confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and
cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive
extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query,
based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation
costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is
Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring
convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the
well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our
Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both
classification and regression tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT prompting improves ICL in LLMs by breaking reasoning into steps, but its generalization under distribution shift is unclear. This study extends a latent-variable framework for CoT and tests it on OOD scenarios, finding performance depends on latent variable similarity to training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how CoT prompting generalizes under distribution shift, particularly in OOD scenarios, and identify its strengths and limitations.

Method: Extends a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and evaluates it on two OOD scenarios: permuted latent variables and uniformly scaled latent variables.

Result: CoT generalizes well when OOD samples' latent variables resemble training data but degrades as similarity decreases.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into CoT's behavior under OOD conditions and suggests directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to
improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking
complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to
generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we
extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on
two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables
for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent
variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT
inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely
resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this
similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the
strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest
directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在图分析中表现优异，但其推理过程成本高昂，限制了在大规模图上的应用。

Method: 提出了三种IFGC具体方案：SPGC、(α, r)-压缩和锚定压缩，分别针对不同需求优化压缩与推理效率。

Result: 实验验证了IFGC在大规模图上的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: IFGC为GNN推理提供了一种高效且灵活的图压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph
analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering
their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly
graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs
inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed
graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that
the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little
decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference
equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not
distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical
specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving
compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN
inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a
configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and
anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of
interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms
with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct
extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the
effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单链蛋白质建模已有深入研究，但多链蛋白质的研究仍较少，而这对理解生物功能至关重要。

Method: APM整合原子级信息并利用多链蛋白质数据，支持多链蛋白质的折叠和逆折叠任务。

Result: APM在下游任务中表现出色，通过监督微调提升性能，并在某些任务中支持零样本采样，取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: APM为多链蛋白质建模提供了高效工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or
biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on
single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with
advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these
developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely
uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions.
Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom
Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling
multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data
on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain
interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from
scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain
proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it
achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also
supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自监督学习（PRH）的理论基础，解释其成功背后的原因，并填补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 通过综合可识别性理论（IT）的证据，提出扩展的奇异可识别性理论（SITh）。

Result: SITh为SSL提供了更广泛的理论框架，有助于理解其隐含的数据假设。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注SSL的训练动态、有限样本的影响以及归纳偏置的作用，以推动更可解释和泛化的表示学习。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.

Motivation: 解决深度学习轨迹预测模型在分布外泛化中的挑战，如数据不平衡和多样性不足。

Method: 将轨迹预测重新定义为分类任务，使用异方差谱归一化高斯过程分离不确定性，并从自然语言驾驶规则中提取先验。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，尤其在低数据和跨场景下，不确定性校准和位移指标显著提升。

Conclusion: SHIFT在复杂场景（如交叉路口）中表现出色，为轨迹预测提供了更鲁棒和校准的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising
capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their
out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to
ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral
Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that
uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors
derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory
prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic
spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels,
which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as
stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation
framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the
nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,
demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In
particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where
uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:

Method: 通过构建一个全面的分类法，分析了Hadamard积在深度学习中的四大应用领域：高阶相关性、多模态数据融合、动态表示调制和高效成对操作。

Result: 研究表明，Hadamard积在计算效率和表示能力之间提供了优异的权衡，特别适用于资源受限的场景和多模态任务。

Conclusion: Hadamard积是一种多功能的核心原语，为深度学习架构的未来创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural
design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied
primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across
various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed
as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy
of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains:
higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation
modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability
to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it
particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing
scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks,
such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation
masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This
systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard
product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation
for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product
as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between
computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a
crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication
programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in

Result: 在多个葡萄品种的真实数据上验证，TAL能有效利用物候数据提升抗寒性预测准确性。

Conclusion: TAL为缺乏抗寒数据的作物提供了新的预测方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending
on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy
season. This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models,
which help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures.
Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for
some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.
Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of
budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we
introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels
(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more
accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is
available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks
(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and
auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is
assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict
primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.
Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our
knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we
propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that
can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our
results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape
cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve
cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real
improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we
propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.
MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal
pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit
localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and
connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,
attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable
localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate
model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find
that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit
localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS
method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,
standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB
enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that
there has been real progress in the field.

Result: 实验表明，Miras框架下的模型在语言建模、常识推理等任务中表现优异，甚至超越Transformer和现代线性循环模型。

Conclusion: Miras为深度学习架构设计提供了新思路，其灵活性和性能优势为未来研究开辟了方向。

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the
core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models.
Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural
tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural
architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent
neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and
values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias.
Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either
(1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their
attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of
alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective
approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret
forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of
retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence
models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to
design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative
memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and
(iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta,
Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while
maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show
different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For
example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special
tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive
tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将LLM的对齐技术应用于CAD模型中的工程草图约束生成任务的方法，旨在解决设计对齐问题，通过反馈训练显著提升了约束生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法生成的CAD设计难以与设计意图对齐，导致几何更新不可预测，因此需要一种新方法来生成完全约束且不扭曲几何的草图。

Method: 利用对齐技术训练现有的约束生成模型，通过约束求解器的反馈优化模型，生成完全约束的草图。

Result: 实验表明，使用对齐技术后，93%的草图被完全约束，显著优于基线方法的34%和未对齐方法的8.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何现有约束生成模型，并为语言与设计领域的对齐策略研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating
engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models.
Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines)
connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the
relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints
must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates
predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate
CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design
intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards
aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain
all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch
geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation
model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain
93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to
any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further
research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高炉温度的准确预测和稳定控制对钢铁生产效率至关重要，传统方法难以应对其复杂非线性波动。

Method: 结合经典机器学习与量子计算算法，采用基于预测的优化方法，利用量子增强特征空间探索和经典回归模型。

Result: 预测准确性提高超过25%，温度稳定性从±50度提升至±7.6度。

Conclusion: 混合量子机器学习模型在工业钢铁生产中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are
crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production.
Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of
the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel
approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal
injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine
learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance
predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we
utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages
quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical
regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized
coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in
prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature
stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50
degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models
in industrial steel production applications.

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum
computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful
quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is
based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits
varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth,
width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our
featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a
widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and
depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum
computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example
benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to
produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression.
Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of
volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive
two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

Motivation: 从信息论角度研究量子信道区分，关注在未知信道访问次数下错误概率的最优衰减率，转而探讨查询复杂度，即达到目标错误概率所需的最小信道使用次数。

Method: 通过分析二进制信道区分的查询复杂度，发现其与错误概率的对数和信道保真度的负对数相关。同时，研究了非对称二进制信道和多量子信道区分的查询复杂度。

Result: 二进制信道区分的查询复杂度与错误概率的对数和信道保真度的负对数相关。非对称二进制信道区分的查询复杂度与几何Rényi和Petz Rényi信道散度相关，多量子信道区分的查询复杂度与信道保真度的负对数相关，且上界与信道数量的对数成正比。

Conclusion: 量子信道区分的查询复杂度与错误概率和信道保真度密切相关，为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic
perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error
probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this
paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein
the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a
desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of
binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error
probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and
Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely
characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical
channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of
binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel
discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric
R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends
on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For
multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the
number of channels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用XL-MIMO系统的特性实现高效的无线边缘推理，同时降低复杂度，适用于超低功耗设备。

Method: 将XL-MIMO信道系数视为隐藏层的随机节点，接收端的模拟组合器作为可训练的输出层，将其映射到ELM框架中。

Result: XL-MIMO-ELM实现了与深度学习相当的性能，但复杂度显著降低，支持近即时训练和高效分类。

Conclusion: XL-MIMO系统可作为神经网络使用，为超低功耗设备提供高效的无线边缘推理解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining
components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator,
similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel
coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog
combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for
Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital
processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables
near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the
paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside
their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and
conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with
orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low
power wireless devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSD2法规和开放银行框架为银行和金融科技公司提供了新的机会，但银行领域的特定文本语料处理仍未得到充分解决。

Method: 系统包括数据收集、标注、预处理、建模和评估阶段，结合语言特定技术和领域知识。

Result: 相比通用方法，该系统在性能和效率上表现出显著提升。

Conclusion: 该系统为银行领域特定文本语料的处理提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the
Open Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and
fintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of
building a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this
understanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and
tailored services.
  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques
has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the
past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain
unaddressed especially in the banking sector.
  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction
classification system with a focus on the french market and french language
text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,
modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general
classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the
challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus
(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific
techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced
performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在相关性判断任务中的表现，并分析提示变化对结果的影响。

Method: 收集了来自15名人类专家和15个LLM的90个提示，筛选后使用72个提示和3个LLM对TREC数据集进行标注，并与人类标签进行比较。

Result: 通过Cohen's κ和成对一致性度量比较LLM与人类标签的一致性，并分析提示差异和不同LLM的表现。

Conclusion: 研究支持LLM在相关性判断中的应用，并提供了数据和提示资源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate relevance
judgments for information retrieval (IR) tasks, often demonstrating agreement
with human labels that approaches inter-human agreement. To assess the
robustness and reliability of LLM-based relevance judgments, we systematically
investigate impact of prompt sensitivity on the task. We collected prompts for
relevance assessment from 15 human experts and 15 LLMs across three tasks~ --
~binary, graded, and pairwise~ -- ~yielding 90 prompts in total. After
filtering out unusable prompts from three humans and three LLMs, we employed
the remaining 72 prompts with three different LLMs as judges to label
document/query pairs from two TREC Deep Learning Datasets (2020 and 2021). We
compare LLM-generated labels with TREC official human labels using Cohen's
$\kappa$ and pairwise agreement measures. In addition to investigating the
impact of prompt variations on agreement with human labels, we compare human-
and LLM-generated prompts and analyze differences among different LLMs as
judges. We also compare human- and LLM-generated prompts with the standard
UMBRELA prompt used for relevance assessment by Bing and TREC 2024 Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. To support future research in LLM-based
evaluation, we release all data and prompts at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实用户数据的稀缺性和隐私问题，需要一种可信且经济高效的方法来模拟用户行为。

Method: SimUSER从历史数据中识别自洽的用户画像，并通过配备人格、记忆、感知和大脑模块的代理用户与推荐系统交互。

Result: SimUSER在微观和宏观层面均比先前工作更接近真实用户行为，并通过实验探索了缩略图、曝光效应和评论对用户参与的影响。

Conclusion: 基于离线A/B测试结果优化推荐系统参数，SimUSER显著提升了真实世界中的用户参与度。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications,
yet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap
between offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits
(e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent
framework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER
first identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user
profiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this
evaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain
modules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits
closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro
levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects
of thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on
user engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on
offline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real
world.

Conclusion: 论文提供了全面的LLM相关性评估方法比较，为未来研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both academic and
industry settings to automate the evaluation of information seeking systems,
particularly by generating graded relevance judgments. Previous work on
LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded
human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there
has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive
comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple
LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments,
graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two
nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In
addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall
correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human
preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive
experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and
2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain
question answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments
generated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.
Our goal is to \textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods
to provide a comprehensive comparison. All code, data, and resources are

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于正则化损失的方法，用于在神经信息检索模型中高效剪枝文档标记，同时保持检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColBERT等神经IR模型需要大量内存存储文档标记的上下文表示，现有剪枝方法无法保证不影响检索分数。

Method: 引入三种正则化损失和两种剪枝策略，以高剪枝率剪枝标记而不影响查询与文档的分数。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用30%的标记即可保持ColBERT的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证性能的同时显著降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Late interaction neural IR models like ColBERT offer a competitive
effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. However, they
require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the
document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or
statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however
doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval
score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens
without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three
regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well
as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain),
showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\% of the
tokens.

Motivation: 构建现实、可扩展且无污染的IR和RAG评估基准，以推动信息检索领域的发展。

Method: FreshStack通过三步构建基准：自动语料收集、问题答案片段生成，以及混合检索技术的文档检索。

Result: 在五个新兴主题上，现有检索模型表现显著低于理想方法，且重排器在部分主题上效果不明显。

Conclusion: FreshStack为构建高质量IR评估基准提供了工具，并揭示了现有技术的改进空间。

Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a reusable framework for automatically building
information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks from community-asked questions
and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus
collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from
community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving
documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We
use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics
to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing
retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform
oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR
quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve
first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics). We hope that
FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable,
and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks. FreshStack datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态检索方法依赖嵌入相似性计算，而生成式方法虽具潜力，但在标识符构造和生成过程中存在语义信息不足的问题。

Method: 提出SemCORE框架，包括结构化自然语言标识符（SID）和生成语义验证（GSV）策略，以增强语义理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，SemCORE在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中均优于现有方法，Recall@1平均提升8.65分。

Conclusion: SemCORE通过语义增强的生成方法，显著提升了跨模态检索的性能，为生成式检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research,
focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different
modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via
embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained
generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising
alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and
leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to
input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current
generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both
identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval
framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding
capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first
construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively
aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language
comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic
Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination.
Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to
simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks
within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval
methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark
datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image
retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在代码生成方面取得了进展，但生成的代码质量仍面临重复问题，导致效率低下和可读性降低。

Method: 通过定量和定性分析19种最先进的代码LLM，总结了20种重复模式，并提出了DeRep技术。

Result: DeRep在减少重复（平均提升91.3%、93.5%和79.9%）和提升代码质量（Pass@1提升208.3%）方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DeRep有效解决了代码重复问题，并提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
the quality of LLM-generated code still faces significant challenges. One
significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to
generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced
readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to
investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art
code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive
and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character,
statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition
patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique
designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep
using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results
demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing
repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3,
rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1
increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves
the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1
improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.

Conclusion: 该方法为通用查询分析工具奠定了基础，但仍需进一步形式化存在语言以实现完全可计算性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use
cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative
evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.

TL;DR: AI天气模型在性能上接近传统数值天气预报（NWP），但仍存在系统偏差和可靠性问题。研究发现，对AI模型的统计后处理方法可直接沿用NWP的方法，且结合AI与NWP模型能提升整体预报能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证AI天气模型是否可以通过传统NWP的统计后处理方法（如IMPROVER系统）提升预报准确性，并探索AI与NWP模型结合的效果。

Method: 应用IMPROVER系统对ECMWF的AI确定性预报系统（AIFS）进行后处理，并与传统NWP模型（HRES和ENS）的后处理结果对比。

Result: 后处理显著提升了AIFS的预报准确性，且AI与NWP模型结合后整体预报能力更强。

Conclusion: 统计后处理方法可直接用于AI模型，为气象中心提供低风险、渐进式整合AI预报的途径。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching
operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and
reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's
existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic
Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against
post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any
modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields
comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in
both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with
NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the
most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing
methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling
national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing
workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于群体学习（SL）的电池管理系统，通过分散式框架和基于可信权重的模型合并机制，在数据有限场景下提升电池容量估计的准确性，同时确保数据隐私和安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法在电池管理中潜力巨大，但数据有限场景下性能不足，且缺乏同时保障数据隐私和容错性的框架。

Method: 采用分散式群体学习框架和基于可信权重的模型合并机制，验证了66个商用LiNiCoAlO2电池的数据集。

Result: SL在所有数据有限场景下均提升了估计准确性，并在数据充足时达到与集中学习相当的精度。

Conclusion: 群体学习框架在数据有限场景下有效提升了电池容量估计的准确性，同时保障了数据隐私和安全。

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery
management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is
bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery
data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable
data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that
simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This
paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized
swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging
mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios
while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework
is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled
under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation
performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased,
feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can
enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar
level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are
available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过生成模型（ReFT）设计新型拓扑绝缘体（TIs）和拓扑晶体绝缘体（TCIs）的方法，成功生成了大量新材料，并以Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$为例展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在寻找具有完整带隙的拓扑材料时效率低下，因此需要开发新方法生成此类材料。

Method: 采用强化微调（ReFT）对预训练生成模型进行优化，使其更符合材料设计目标。

Result: ReFT显著提升了模型生成TIs和TCIs的能力，并成功发现了大量新材料，如Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$（带隙0.26 eV）。

Conclusion: ReFT是一种高效生成拓扑材料的方法，为材料设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.

Abstract: From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global
priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more
dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress
lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an
AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover
potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts,
Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot
on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,
and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis
reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage
of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new
central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal
clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,
resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework
offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公众对AI系统的期望及其跨国差异，为AI治理提供实证依据。

Method: 通过德国（n=1800）和美国（n=1756）的两项调查，分析公众对AI功能的支持程度及其影响因素。

Result: 美国公众对AI功能支持更高；两国均最重视准确性和安全性，规范性目标支持较弱；德国更受个人经验和言论自由态度影响，美国则更统一。

Conclusion: 研究强调需基于公众态度实证讨论AI对齐问题，并将规范性期望纳入AI治理理论和政策。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public
awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications.
Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems
meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values.
However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and
how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence
from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of
AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We
examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and
reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational
imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and
consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader
technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both
countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more
normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries --
receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how
individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political
ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and
free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S.
responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure
to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates
on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More
broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment
debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded
expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of
AI-generated content.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于命名实体识别（NER）技术的数据集，用于从大规模枪击事件中提取关键信息，支持法律和调查工作。实验表明，GPT-4o在NER任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模枪击事件产生大量非结构化文本数据，传统方法难以有效提取关键信息，亟需自动化工具支持调查和公共政策制定。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行少样本提示，从新闻、警方报告和社交媒体中提取关键实体（如罪犯、受害者、地点等）。

Result: GPT-4o在NER任务中表现最优，o1-mini在资源有限情况下表现良好。增加样本量能提升所有模型性能，尤其是GPT-4o和o1-mini。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模枪击事件的信息提取提供了高效工具，GPT-4o和o1-mini在不同场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,
generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective
investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few
prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from
these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented
the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events
through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It
focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and
criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The
NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot
prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical
information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and
social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora
demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,
achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.
Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a
resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed
that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the
gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior
adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.

Method: 通过分析一个关于AI伦理的免费大学MOOC课程中学生提交的论文数据，比较ChatGPT发布前后的变化。

Result: ChatGPT的发布导致学生论文的长度和风格显著变化，但主题内容未明显改变。

Conclusion: ChatGPT对在线教育的影响主要体现在形式而非内容上，需进一步关注其长期影响。

Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern
in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to
generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual
accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and
computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to
unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we
quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs)
on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay
responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes
essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the
launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and
style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as
academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public
discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs,
but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student
essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.

Result: 建立了aporophobia的分类体系，并训练了分类器，但自动检测仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模识别和减少社交媒体上的aporophobia奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eradicating poverty is the first goal in the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. However, aporophobia -- the societal bias against people
living in poverty -- constitutes a major obstacle to designing, approving and
implementing poverty-mitigation policies. This work presents an initial step
towards operationalizing the concept of aporophobia to identify and track
harmful beliefs and discriminative actions against poor people on social media.
In close collaboration with non-profits and governmental organizations, we
conduct data collection and exploration. Then we manually annotate a corpus of
English tweets from five world regions for the presence of (1) direct
expressions of aporophobia, and (2) statements referring to or criticizing
aporophobic views or actions of others, to comprehensively characterize the
social media discourse related to bias and discrimination against the poor.
Based on the annotated data, we devise a taxonomy of categories of aporophobic
attitudes and actions expressed through speech on social media. Finally, we
train several classifiers and identify the main challenges for automatic
detection of aporophobia in social networks. This work paves the way towards
identifying, tracking, and mitigating aporophobic views on social media at
scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应的储层计算机（RC）机制，通过动态调整兴奋-抑制（E-I）平衡来提高性能，减少超参数调优需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算机（RCs）虽然计算高效，但对超参数敏感且忽略了神经元动态中的E-I平衡，这是大脑功能的关键。

Method: 引入自适应的E/I平衡机制，局部调整以实现目标神经元放电率，并结合大脑启发的异质性。

Result: 在记忆能力和时间序列预测任务中，性能提升高达130%，且减少了超参数调优需求。

Conclusion: 动态适应机制显著提升了RC的性能和鲁棒性，为神经计算提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to
deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired
computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random,
fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs
simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture.
Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal
dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is
essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically
perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming
excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter
tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance
to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in
tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally
tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing
rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs
to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from
static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating
how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while
deepening our understanding of neural computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型中学习过程的动态特性，特别是泛化能力的延迟出现。

Method: 通过实证研究，分析隐藏层与输入数据之间的互信息，并与其他指标（如局部复杂性和线性映射数）对比。

Result: 发现两个阶段的时间尺度在不同设置下对齐，压缩阶段可能未被标准训练算法主动优化。

Conclusion: 压缩阶段是一种重要的遗忘形式，对泛化至关重要，类似于重整化群的概念。

Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a
rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining
phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three
phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of
which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error
reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two
rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input
data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics
such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the
second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may
be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization
group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of
forgetting, critical for generalization.

Motivation: 研究匿名公共公告的逻辑特性，填补公共公告逻辑与代理公告之间的空白，并探索公告者意图对信息揭示的影响。

Method: 首先分析无意图假设的情况，将匿名公共公告逻辑简化为认知逻辑；然后研究共同知识意图的情况，将其与“安全”公告概念联系起来。

Result: 提出了形式化的表达结果和关键逻辑语言的公理完备性。

Conclusion: 匿名公共公告在特定条件下可简化为认知逻辑，而在共同知识意图下则与安全公告相关，为逻辑分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We formalise the notion of an \emph{anonymous public announcement} in the
tradition of public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as
in-between a public announcement from ``the outside" (an announcement of
$\phi$) and a public announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of
$K_a\phi$): we get more information than just $\phi$, but not (necessarily)
about exactly who made it. Even if such an announcement is prima facie
anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal
the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the
information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore,
like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention
was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this
paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made,
in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is
reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common
knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and
more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe"
announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards). Main results include formal
expressivity results and axiomatic completeness for key logical languages.

Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful
compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is
limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and
performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to
increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a
prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology
data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing
reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using
guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures
biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We
demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset
achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models
trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our
synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across
multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on
orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic
and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several
evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create
compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the
reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our
approach.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中3D数据异常样本稀缺，限制了视觉基础模型的潜力。

Method: 通过将点云投影到2D平面，从Perlin噪声场采样多尺度噪声值，并沿法线方向扰动点云，生成真实的3D表面异常。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成多样化的缺陷模式，并在不同物体类型上产生几何合理的异常。

Conclusion: 3D-PNAS为3D工业质量检测提供了有效的异常生成工具，并提供了代码库和可视化工具包。

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in
various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity
of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.
While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established
generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has
made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In
contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,
limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address
this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,
based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates
realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,
sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the
point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization
experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,
perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the
generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from
pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our
cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet
geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to
their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive
codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机神经网络中吸引子行为的动态变化及其对称性约束。

Method: 通过调整全局参数，分析相空间结构，揭示吸引子合并的机制。

Result: 发现这种分岔现象是随机神经网络的固有特性，与训练数据无关。

Conclusion: 吸引子合并危机是储层计算中普遍存在的现象，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs),
generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent
symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging
crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global
parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed
analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation
scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

TL;DR: 论文提出LinkQ系统，通过知识图谱查询减少LLM幻觉，在QA任务中表现优于GPT-4，但仍需改进特定问题类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险的网络操作领域需要可信赖的AI方法，而LLM存在幻觉问题。

Method: 开发LinkQ系统，强制LLM在QA过程中查询知识图谱以获取真实数据。

Result: LinkQ在KGQA数据集上表现优于GPT-4，但在某些问题类别上仍有困难。

Conclusion: 未来需研究替代查询策略，专家反馈为系统改进提供了方向。

Abstract: High-stakes domains like cyber operations need responsible and trustworthy AI
methods. While large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular
in these domains, they still suffer from hallucinations. This research paper
provides learning outcomes from a case study with LinkQ, an open-source natural
language interface that was developed to combat hallucinations by forcing an
LLM to query a knowledge graph (KG) for ground-truth data during
question-answering (QA). We conduct a quantitative evaluation of LinkQ using a
well-known KGQA dataset, showing that the system outperforms GPT-4 but still
struggles with certain question categories - suggesting that alternative query
construction strategies will need to be investigated in future LLM querying
systems. We discuss a qualitative study of LinkQ with two domain experts using
a real-world cybersecurity KG, outlining these experts' feedback, suggestions,
perceived limitations, and future opportunities for systems like LinkQ.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文指出，当前可解释AI（XAI）研究中，使用大型语言模型（LLM）将解释性技术输出转化为自然语言解释的趋势存在潜在问题，可能导致用户过度依赖AI系统。作者建议LLM应扮演“魔鬼代言人”角色，主动质疑AI解释，以促进用户批判性思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前XAI研究中LLM翻译解释性输出的趋势，揭示其可能导致的用户过度依赖问题，并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过分析现有研究和趋势，提出LLM应作为“魔鬼代言人”主动质疑AI解释，而非简单翻译。

Result: 研究发现，单纯翻译XAI输出可能强化可解释性幻觉，而LLM的批判性角色有助于减少用户过度依赖。

Conclusion: 建议LLM在XAI中扮演批判性角色，通过质疑和展示局限性，提升用户对AI系统的理解和透明度。

Abstract: This position paper highlights a growing trend in Explainable AI (XAI)
research where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate outputs from
explainability techniques, like feature-attribution weights, into a natural
language explanation. While this approach may improve accessibility or
readability for users, recent findings suggest that translating into human-like
explanations does not necessarily enhance user understanding and may instead
lead to overreliance on AI systems. When LLMs summarize XAI outputs without
surfacing model limitations, uncertainties, or inconsistencies, they risk
reinforcing the illusion of interpretability rather than fostering meaningful
transparency. We argue that - instead of merely translating XAI outputs - LLMs
should serve as constructive agitators, or devil's advocates, whose role is to
actively interrogate AI explanations by presenting alternative interpretations,
potential biases, training data limitations, and cases where the model's
reasoning may break down. In this role, LLMs can facilitate users in engaging
critically with AI systems and generated explanations, with the potential to
reduce overreliance caused by misinterpreted or specious explanations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI写作工具如何影响作者的自主权与所有权，通过系统综述和访谈揭示了不同写作阶段对AI干预的需求差异，并提出了四种设计策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具如ChatGPT在日常写作中的普及，如何保持作者的自主权与所有权成为关键问题，但目前缺乏系统性的研究。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法系统综述了109篇HCI论文，并访谈了15位不同领域的作者。

Result: 发现作者对AI干预的需求因写作阶段而异：内容型作者（如学者）重视规划阶段的自主权，而形式型作者（如创意工作者）更关注翻译和修订阶段的控制。

Conclusion: 研究为开发以人为本的AI协作写作工具提供了设计指导，强调了在不同写作阶段满足作者需求的重要性。

Abstract: As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing,
critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and
ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI
assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this
shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From
this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing
support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and
critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:
planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis
with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that
writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:
content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,
while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and
reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,
and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,
what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both
alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer
actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for
co-writing with AI, on human terms.

Conclusion: 该研究为量化MLLMs可解释性提供了新方法，有助于提升人类推理能力并改进数据集标注。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context
of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing
on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the
applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To
this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology
and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use
them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual
content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability
principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that
primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics
from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive
model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to
assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual
perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled
study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for
applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in
existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Motivation: 研究高维空间中反射哈密顿蒙特卡洛方法在特定初始化和目标分布下的慢混合问题，揭示其机制并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用Sinkhorn散度量化的瞬时非均匀性分析混合问题，研究球体和立方体中的集体运动行为，构建低维玩具模型，并与精确哈密顿粒子流对比。

Result: 发现集体运动在流体行为和离散化主导行为之间转变，临界步长随维度呈幂律缩放，粒子可能自发解混导致密度共振。低维模型重现了高维问题的主要特征。

Conclusion: 揭示了高维反射哈密顿蒙特卡洛方法的混合问题机制，提出了临界步长和调参实践的重要性，并通过低维模型验证了结果。

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact
reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from
a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By
quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the
Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the
mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion
transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the
critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes,
the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle
density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy
models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of
the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the
exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据集中异常值和污染问题，提升变分贝叶斯方法的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 将数据集划分为子集，独立计算后验并应用变分近似，通过Wasserstein距离的几何中位数聚合子集后验。

Result: 提出的VM-Posterior保留了真实后验的收缩性质，并提供了鲁棒性保证，适用于复杂污染数据集。

Conclusion: VM-Posterior是一种可靠的工具，适用于存在异常值的贝叶斯推断，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that
effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large
datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the
posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these
posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets
are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures,
computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation
method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We
rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties
akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors
or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable
robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a
variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian
distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational
family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms
for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive
numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability,
making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex,
contaminated datasets.

Conclusion: 加权谱算法改进了现有理论结果，解决了无界密度比场景下的次优问题，提升了谱算法的性能。

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze
and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised
learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in
real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may
differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of
spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the
framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case
of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input
data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional
distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this
setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show
that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the
training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also
identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the
spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we
propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio
information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this
weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates.
Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that
the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the
optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This
improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio
scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨随机化在随机森林中的作用，特别是在不同SNR和数据特性下的表现，以更全面地理解其有效性。

Method: 通过系统分析不同SNR场景下的MSE，并结合模拟研究，考察随机化在多种数据特性（如厚尾分布、无关变量、相关变量）中的效果。

Result: 随机化在低SNR下有效，但在厚尾分布中可能增加偏差；无关变量下效果有限，而相关变量下表现良好。此外，相关变量还能显著降低偏差。

Conclusion: 随机化的有效性不仅取决于SNR，还与数据特性密切相关。相关变量的存在为随机森林的优异表现提供了新的解释。

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests.
Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce
variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization
regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First,
we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a
systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR
scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that
variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform
bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias
for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a
question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and
moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other
data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can
increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates;
(ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective
because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually
correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias.
Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias
can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This
last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by
variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our
findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding
of why random forests work well in many applications.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络宽度对训练动态的影响，特别是在无限宽度与多项式宽度之间的近似差距。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降和均值场动态，通过微分方程分析近似差距，重点关注局部Hessian的作用。

Result: 证明了在满足自协调性质的条件下，多项式数量的神经元足以在整个训练过程中近似均值场动态。

Conclusion: 多项式宽度的神经网络可以有效近似无限宽度网络的动态，尤其在单索引模型的特征学习中。

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width
neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected
gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to
tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed
by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is
the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's
velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our
results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a
well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be
arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the
ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance''
property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded
by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are
sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

TL;DR: 论文研究了无限维二次问题中SGD类优化的收敛速率，提出了一种广义的带无限记忆的SGD方法，实现了接近最优的收敛速率，并通过有限内存算法高效近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无限维二次问题中，确定性GD的收敛速率可以通过非稳态Jacobi-based调度提升，但在SGD中，采样噪声导致Jacobi HB发散。因此，需要一种新的方法在SGD中实现类似的加速。

Method: 通过将广义(S)GD算法与复平面中的轮廓关联，提出具有特定外部角的轮廓可以加速收敛。在SGD中，优化外部角以平衡加速和噪声效应，并通过有理近似实现有限内存算法。

Result: 证明了最优收敛速率为θ_max=min(2,ν,2/(ζ+1/ν))，并通过实验验证了有限内存算法的实际效率。

Conclusion: 广义SGD方法在无限维二次问题中实现了接近最优的收敛速率，且可通过有限内存算法高效实现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems
with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems
deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be
improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary
Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules).
However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the
Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In
this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a
generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying
generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show
that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the
plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD,
increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to
$O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies
the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing
the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by
$\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the
exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions.
Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show
that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory
algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem
and MNIST.

Conclusion: 方法具有广泛适用性，可用于多种随机逼近问题，并能构造快速（如线性）收敛速率。

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic
processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our
result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and
effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean
and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only
depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration.
We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known
concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing
effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's
convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er
monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly
general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro
procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their
applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of
potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other
well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range
of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied.
Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even
allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound
exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech
(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling
the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose
EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language
models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion
control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme
tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by
chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we
introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring
expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language
descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English
EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese
Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability
of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human
perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and
Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at

Result: CEC在与人协作中表现优于基线方法，表明多场景训练能促进通用协作规范的开发。

Conclusion: 多环境训练是设计通用协作AI的新途径，无需依赖人类数据。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a
cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior
work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these
specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly
similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of
environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills
that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two
Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination
challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation
(CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and
qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that
learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to
develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different
partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist
cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human
data.

(MAS) within artificial intelligence (AI) art creation, such as collaboration
efficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism.
The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration,
single-agent multi-role playing, single-agent multi-scene traversal,
single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the
same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different
large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the
same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the
framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene
adaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges
such as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system
security, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning
and federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for
multi-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative
applications in the art field.

Abstract: Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新算法QLLM，用于解决多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题，通过TFCAF概念和定制化的coder-evaluator框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题存在贡献归属不精确、可解释性差和可扩展性不足等挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出QLLM算法，利用LLM自动构建信用分配函数，引入TFCAF概念，并通过coder-evaluator框架生成、验证和优化可执行代码。

Result: 在多个标准MARL基准测试中，QLLM表现优于现有方法，并展现出强大的泛化能力和兼容性。

Conclusion: QLLM是一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于复杂多智能体场景。

Abstract: Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需显式访问生成模型分布的黑盒可证明安全隐写方案，通过动态采样策略实现高效隐蔽通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可证明安全隐写方法需要显式访问生成模型分布，限制了黑盒场景下的实用性。

Method: 采用动态采样策略，使生成模型在不干扰正常生成过程的情况下嵌入秘密信息。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三个大语言模型上的评估表明，该方法在效率和容量上与现有白盒方法相当，且避免了模型输出退化。

Conclusion: 该方案为黑盒场景下的隐蔽通信提供了实用且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: The security of private communication is increasingly at risk due to
widespread surveillance. Steganography, a technique for embedding secret
messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored
channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making
stego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational
indistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current
PSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative
model for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme
that does not require access to explicit model distributions for both sender
and receiver. Our method incorporates a dynamic sampling strategy, enabling
generative models to embed secret messages within multiple sampling choices
without disrupting the normal generation process of the model. Extensive
evaluations of three real world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our
blackbox method is comparable with existing white-box steganography methods in
terms of efficiency and capacity while eliminating the degradation of
steganography in model generated outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Agentic AI的普及，模型能力快速提升，但数据孤岛和集成问题限制了其扩展性，同时MCP协议的灵活性引入了新的安全风险。

Method: 提出MCP Guardian框架，通过多种安全措施（如认证、限速、WAF扫描）加强MCP协议的安全性。

Result: 实证测试表明，MCP Guardian能有效抵御攻击，确保稳健的监管且开销低。

Conclusion: MCP Guardian为AI助手提供了安全、可扩展的数据访问，强调了深度防御策略在AI驱动环境中的重要性。

Abstract: As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model
capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these
systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration
requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol
(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for
securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP
servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including
malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,
a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,
rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.
Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP
Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with
minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI
assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that
enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a
data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level.
We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and
show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological
systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to
non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a
transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data,
incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected
in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings,
we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of
divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy
variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide
a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a
computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with
molecular resolution.

TL;DR: Human2Sim2Robot框架通过单段RGB-D视频训练机器人灵巧操作策略，利用强化学习跨越人-机器人形态差异，无需大规模数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大量演示数据或穿戴设备，难以扩展；视频数据易获取但缺乏动作标签且形态差异大。

Method: 从视频提取物体姿态轨迹和手部初始姿态，定义无形态依赖的奖励函数并指导强化学习训练。

Result: Human2Sim2Robot在抓取、非抓取操作和多步任务中分别比基线方法提升55%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据扩展和形态差异问题，无需任务特定奖励设计。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting
hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is
challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect
and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to
the lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences
between robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel
real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies
using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes
reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment
gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection
typically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we
extract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define
an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the
pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL
training. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning
the desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and
tuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop
trajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68%
across grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks. Project

Result: 模型在复杂环境中成功预测全局位置，平均定位准确率为77%±2m，性能优于基线方法两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了建筑工地中的定位问题，展示了扩散模型在机器人定位中的潜力。

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to
perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in
construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of
repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to
apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus
on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned
mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network
is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in
an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a
PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from
a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the
global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse
effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global
positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our
approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition
accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2
in mean error.

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as
robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or
heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these
simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between
simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a
physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of
well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only
minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency
yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We
demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned
friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately
simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially,
we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to
systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple
systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks,
offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap
in robotics and control.

Abstract: Adapting robot trajectories based on human instructions as per new situations
is essential for achieving more intuitive and scalable human-robot
interactions. This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt
generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like
RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained
LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense
robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than
current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of
commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art
feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method
does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and
more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation
experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the
Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can
successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了定性表示与深度学习方法结合在自动驾驶可解释场景理解中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with
Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated
driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive
decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an
explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or
who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness
using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to
analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader
scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph
structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our
method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated
relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach
achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model
effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object
identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal
relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the
potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning
approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex
object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced
autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality
demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits
such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital
twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language
models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned
evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates
varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and
interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code
generation framework that combines object annotations with large language
models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise
robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both
simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better
alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated
our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies
pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world
samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic
manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm
tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on
real-world data.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for robotic systems, yet
progress has been limited by hardware trade-offs between precision,
compactness, strength, and affordability. Existing control methods impose
compromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based
approaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to
address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This
work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable,
and capable. Made from 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has
5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like
grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact,
human-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn
joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data
collected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and
strength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase
RUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in
biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts
and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest.
However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution
and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably
extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge,
we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to
adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in
inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of
simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing
techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully
identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two
subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is
able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the
studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and
robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving
biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for
the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The
development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces
challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex
environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task
balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The
method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning
strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to
jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The
channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic
features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on
the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\%
classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,
significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular
state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic
benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic

TL;DR: 本文综述了原型分析（AA）的方法、应用及未来研究方向，强调了其在特征提取和降维中的解释性优势，同时指出了非凸优化问题的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型分析（AA）因其直观、可解释的特性在科学领域广泛应用，但其非凸优化问题带来挑战，本文旨在全面梳理AA的方法、应用及未来方向。

Method: 综述了AA的计算方法，包括如何从观测数据中提取原型，并通过凸组合近似表示观测记录。

Result: AA在特征提取和降维中表现出色，广泛应用于多个科学领域，但其非凸优化问题仍需解决。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注AA的优化问题及其在更多领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and
Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called
archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a
mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides
straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature
extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the
structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the
sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated
optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data
mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has
to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of
science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations.
The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions
concerning AA.

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of
functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate
distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and
the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of
the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend
to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions
used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious
models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for
simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

*Vinay Shukla,Prachee Sharma,Ryan Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Tong Yu,Aditya Grover*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: WaterFlow (WF) 是一种基于学习潜在依赖水印的快速、高保真视觉水印方法，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型和可逆流层提升鲁棒性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像水印嵌入是计算机视觉中的重要问题，现有方法在计算速度、鲁棒性或感知质量上存在不足。

Method: 使用预训练的潜在扩散模型将图像编码到潜在空间，并通过可逆流层在傅里叶域嵌入水印。

Result: WaterFlow 在通用鲁棒性上表现最优，并能有效抵御复杂组合攻击。

Conclusion: WaterFlow 是一种高效且鲁棒的水印方法，适用于真实和生成图像数据集。

Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of
interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated
imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from
computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for
practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking
speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this
work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high
fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our
approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary
image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted
into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via
invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the
pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and
tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of
effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our
findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO,
DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.

Main category: eess.IV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在组织病理学中面临标注成本高、计算需求大和缺乏不确定性估计等问题，阻碍了其实际应用。

Method: TUMLS采用自动编码器（AE）作为特征提取器，识别低分辨率训练数据中的组织类型，基于不确定性选择代表性区域，并在高分辨率空间进行无监督核分割。

Result: 在UPENN-GBM数据集上，AE的MSE为0.0016；在MoNuSeg数据集上，核分割的F1分数为77.46%，Jaccard分数为63.35%，优于其他无监督方法。

Conclusion: TUMLS显著提升了数字病理学的工作流程效率和透明度，展示了其在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds
significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However,
challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs),
high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of
uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of
current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present
a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology
(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to
identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It
selects representative patches from each identified group based on an
uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their
respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially,
this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the
examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level
insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow
while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM
dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.
Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,
outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a
Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in
advancing the field of digital pathology.

TL;DR: ViTa是一个多模态框架，整合了心脏磁共振成像和患者个体因素，提供全面的心脏健康评估和疾病风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振成像（CMR）虽是非侵入性心脏评估的金标准，但缺乏对患者个体因素（如人口统计学、代谢和生活方式）的考虑，而这些因素对心血管健康和疾病风险有重要影响。

Method: ViTa利用42,000名UK Biobank参与者的数据，整合3D+T短轴和长轴视图的影像数据，并结合详细的表格化患者个体因素，实现多模态融合。

Result: ViTa支持多种下游任务，包括心脏表型和生理特征预测、分割以及心脏和代谢疾病的分类，通过共享潜在表征实现全面的心脏健康评估。

Conclusion: ViTa超越了传统的任务特定模型，提供了一种通用的、患者特异性的心脏健康理解，具有临床实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive
cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,
and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and
disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand
cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an
individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly
exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have
begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data
and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a
comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a
comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of
individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,
ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling
a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with
detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This
multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including
cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and
classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified
framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging
features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific
models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,
highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in
cardiac analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏优化（SO）框架，通过动态调整少量参数解决视觉语言模型（VLM）在少样本场景下的过拟合和计算限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如低秩重参数化）在泛化和超参数调优上表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用局部稀疏全局密度和局部随机全局重要性两种范式，动态调整参数以减少过拟合。

Result: 在11个数据集上验证，SO在少样本适应性能上达到最优，同时降低内存开销。

Conclusion: SO框架有效解决了VLM在少样本场景下的适应问题，具有高效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled
samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and
computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank
reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with
generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a
novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank
approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method
leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce
two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global
density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while
maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for
\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient
using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This
combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation
in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO
achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频编码器在边缘设备上计算资源受限的问题，并扩展其处理长视频的能力。

Method: 采用自适应Transformer块动态调整隐藏嵌入维度，并结合轻量级分层网络处理长视频。

Result: 在短视频任务中，AdaVid-EgoVLP仅用一半计算资源即达到标准EgoVLP性能，并在同等资源下表现更优；在长视频任务中，通过分层网络实现高效计算与准确性的平衡。

Conclusion: AdaVid为视频编码器在资源受限设备上的高效部署提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in
learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video
encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their
high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained
to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this
paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to
learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational
footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive
transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows
the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show
that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D
dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language
benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given
equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame
count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing
that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational
limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical
network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between
compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统心脏超声检查需要专业人员和高端设备，限制了其在医院外的应用。AI导航系统可以辅助新手操作，扩展超声诊断的使用范围。

Method: 系统基于决策模型，通过离线训练的心脏超声视频进行二分类，判断IVC是否存在，并结合定位算法实时标注IVC位置。

Result: 模型在高品质医院超声视频和低成本Butterfly iQ手持设备上均表现出色，具备零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该系统有望推动超声诊断在非医院环境中的应用，目前已在Butterfly iQ应用中进入临床试验阶段。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose
cardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert
sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally
only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and
algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the
standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease
pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to
predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates
a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying
the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained
offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to
determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The
underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the
learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in
real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on
traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive
zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable
Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the
expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the
guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly
iQ app.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术室工作流优化需要自动识别事件，但隐私问题限制了计算机视觉的应用，因此需要隐私保护方法。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）利用视觉基础模型生成去标识化的DT；2）使用SafeOR模型处理分割掩码和深度图进行事件检测。

Result: 在38次模拟手术试验中，DT方法性能接近或优于原始RGB视频模型。

Conclusion: DT方法支持隐私保护的手术室工作流分析，促进跨机构数据共享，并可能增强模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing
workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of
computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative
events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,
privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection
from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR
workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,
we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic
segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from
conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a
fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for
OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38
simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results
indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves
performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on
detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow
analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions
and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating
domain-specific appearance differences.

Result: 在五个下游任务中验证了CM3AE的有效性，并构建了包含2,535,759对RGB-Event数据的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: CM3AE为事件数据和RGB-Event融合任务提供了强大支持，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power
consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring
pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to
establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in
multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE
pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts
multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images,
and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event
fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion
reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused
multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate
cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a
shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for
multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a
large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the
pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated
the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released
on https://github.com/Event-AHU/CM3AE.

Conclusion: Robo-SGG模块可即插即用，显著提升损坏图像上的场景图生成性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,
Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph
Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph
generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,
with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted
images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to
compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To
obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is
domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted
images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the
domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,
the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed
Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder
(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG
framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and
predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a
plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the
state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative
improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet
tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art
performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We
will release our source code and model.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在分析地球观测数据时忽略了地理空间元数据，限制了其在大规模应用中的性能。

Method: 提出BRIDGE-LC框架，结合细粒度（经纬度）和粗粒度（生物地理区域）空间信息，通过轻量级多层感知机架构进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，整合地理空间信息显著提升了土地覆盖分类性能，尤其是在联合利用细粒度和粗粒度信息时效果最佳。

Conclusion: BRIDGE-LC框架通过地理空间信息的整合，有效提升了土地覆盖分类的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a
critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced
machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery
data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could
enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global
scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level
Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel
deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into
the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging
fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)
spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns
from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for
inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land
cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the
quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt
several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale
land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an
extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all
biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region
is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned
by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the
geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that
integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,
with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and
coarse-grained spatial information.

*Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Dewei Feng,Sekitoshi Kanai,Kazuki Adachi,Daiki Chijiwa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-Refine是一种后预训练方法，通过随机特征对齐（RaFA）和混合对比蒸馏（HyCD）技术，在1个epoch的小数据集训练中减少模态间隙，提升零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态特征空间中存在模态间隙，影响下游任务性能，现有方法成本高或导致零样本性能下降。

Method: 提出CLIP-Refine，结合RaFA和HyCD技术，通过小数据集训练对齐特征空间。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-Refine有效减少模态间隙并提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: CLIP-Refine是一种高效的后预训练方法，无需牺牲零样本性能即可改善模态对齐。

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of
building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates
remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature
spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text
feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing
works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or
fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or
degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a
post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and
fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training
on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To
this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and
hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features
to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random
reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid
soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and
outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both
maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.
Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show
that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the
zero-shot performance.

*Yuning Zhou,Henry Badgery,Matthew Read,James Bailey,Catherine Davey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于主动学习的手术视频帧选择方法，以构建高质量且经济实惠的腹腔镜胆囊切除术数据集，用于语义分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域标注成本高昂，阻碍了深度学习应用。本文旨在通过主动学习降低标注成本，同时提升模型性能。

Method: 采用主动学习方法，利用现有数据集训练的DNN选择新数据中最具信息量的帧进行标注，并逐步扩展训练数据。评估了不同数据信息量度量方法，发现深度特征距离最适合此任务。

Result: 实验表明，仅用主动学习选择的一半数据，DNN在关键解剖结构和手术器械上的性能（0.4349 mIoU）接近使用全数据集训练的模型（0.4374 mIoU）。

Conclusion: 主动学习能有效减少标注成本，同时保持模型性能，为医疗领域的深度学习应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered
related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in
surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning
allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset
construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will
identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same
time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the
newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We
assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep
features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our
experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the
DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over
Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374
mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

*Leyang Li,Shilin Lu,Yan Ren,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANT是一种新的微调框架，通过自动引导去噪轨迹避免生成有害内容，解决了现有概念擦除方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保文本到图像模型的伦理部署需要防止生成有害或不适当内容的技术。现有方法存在局限性，如破坏采样轨迹或依赖启发式锚概念选择。

Method: ANT通过反转分类器自由引导的条件方向，提出轨迹感知目标，保留早期阶段得分函数场的完整性，并利用增强权重显著性图精确识别关键参数。

Result: 实验表明，ANT在单概念和多概念擦除中均达到最先进效果，生成高质量且安全的输出。

Conclusion: ANT提供了一种无需启发式锚概念选择的高效方法，显著提升了概念擦除的性能和生成质量。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective
techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While
concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based
approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting
sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods
rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these
shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which
Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is
built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free
guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content
modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This
inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the
early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image
manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For
single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map
to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly
contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient
erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile
plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both
single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without
compromising the generative fidelity. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合Dense-UNet201优化方法，结合DenseNet201和蜘蛛猴优化算法，显著提升了宫颈细胞图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型难以处理宫颈细胞图像的复杂结构和变化，需改进方法以提高诊断准确性。

Method: 使用预训练的DenseNet201作为U-Net编码器，并通过改进的蜘蛛猴优化算法（SMO）优化模型。

Result: Dense-UNet201在SIPaKMeD数据集上表现优异，准确率96.16%，IoU 91.63%，Dice系数95.63%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了预训练模型和元启发式优化在医学图像分析中的有效性，为宫颈细胞分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis.
However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular
structures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid
Dense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as
the encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey
optimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature
extraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters.
The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance
metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice
coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed
U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a
segmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score
of 95.63%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of image preprocessing,
pretrained models, and metaheuristic optimization in improving medical image
analysis and provide new insights into cervical cell segmentation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的扩散模型训练方法，用于图像编辑，能够在保持结构一致性的同时实现语义对齐，仅需少量参考图像和训练步骤即可完成复杂编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像编辑中结构保留和语义对齐的挑战，减少对大量人工标注或数据集的依赖。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架，结合视觉提示，实现精确且结构一致的图像修改。

Result: 模型在复杂场景中实现了高保真度的编辑，仅需5张参考图像和10次训练步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了用户操作，提升了编辑效果，并展示了在机器人领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based
image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural
preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We
introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion
model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or
curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and
alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve
precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while
maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture
fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling
detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This
approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring
only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental
results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex
scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of
our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of
simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their
utility as proxies for real-world settings.

*Yongqian Peng,Yuxi Ma,Mengmeng Wang,Yuxuan Wang,Yizhou Wang,Chi Zhang,Yixin Zhu,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的组合创造力，提出了IEI框架评估其创造力，并通过实验验证其在理解和生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否具备组合创造力（通过结合现有概念生成新想法），而非仅是训练数据的模式匹配。

Method: 提出IEI框架（识别-解释-隐含），分解创造力过程，并使用CreativeMashup数据集进行验证。

Result: VLMs在理解任务中超越普通人但不及专家；生成任务中，IEI框架显著提升输出创造力。

Conclusion: 为评估人工创造力提供理论基础，并为提升VLMs的创造性生成提供实践指导。

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a
fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their
outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as
synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated
pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,
we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept
blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)
framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying
input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic
implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a
high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according
to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in
comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while
falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating
our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the
creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical
foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for
improving creative generation in VLMs.

*Robin Hesse,Jonas Fischer,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种算法，将多义通道解耦为多个单义通道，提升CNN的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN中多义通道难以解释，阻碍了对网络决策机制的理解。

Method: 通过分析前一层的不同激活模式，解耦多义通道为单义通道。

Result: 增强CNN的可解释性，改进特征可视化等解释技术。

Conclusion: 解耦多义通道是提升CNN可解释性的有效方法。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual
components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger
circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging
since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct
concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an
algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple
channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures
weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel
exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling
these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs,
ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VLCA方法，通过结合语言空间和视觉空间，利用语义空间作为桥梁域，解决领域泛化中图像特征空间难以捕捉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于领域差距，图像特征空间难以找到可靠的共同特征，而语言具有更全面的表达元素。因此，结合语言和视觉空间，利用语义空间作为桥梁域，提升模型在未知目标领域的泛化能力。

Method: VLCA方法在语言空间中利用词向量距离捕捉类别关系的语义表示，在视觉空间中通过低秩近似探索同类样本的共同模式，最后在多模态空间中对齐语言和视觉表示。

Result: 实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VLCA通过结合语言和视觉空间，利用语义桥梁域，显著提升了领域泛化的性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a
domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust
generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps,
it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that
is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision
space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively
convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and
intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and
vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as
the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the
completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic
representation of the relations between categories through word vector
distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of
image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is
explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language
representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal
space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtistAuditor是一种用于文本到图像生成模型的数据使用审计方法，通过分析风格特征判断模型是否使用了特定艺术家的作品进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如扰动或水印）在艺术品或模型已发布后不可行的问题，保护艺术家版权。

Method: 使用风格提取器获取多粒度风格表示，并通过训练判别器进行审计决策。

Result: 在六种模型和数据集组合上AUC值>0.937，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ArtistAuditor在真实场景中表现优异，为艺术版权保护提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

Motivation: 现有大型视频模型（LVMs）在视频理解中存在与人类直觉不对齐和视频幻觉问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出VistaDPO框架，在实例、时间和感知三个层次对齐文本-视频偏好，并构建VistaDPO-7k数据集支持细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验表明VistaDPO显著提升LVMs性能，有效缓解不对齐和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: VistaDPO为视频-语言对齐提供有效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human
intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we
introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal
Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference
alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall
video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal
semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial
objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained
video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of
7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with
spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video
Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that
VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively
mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are

Abstract: We propose a method to transfer pose and expression between face images.
Given a source and target face portrait, the model produces an output image in

target identity. The architecture consists of two encoders and a mapping
network that projects the two inputs into the latent space of StyleGAN2, which
finally generates the output. The training is self-supervised from video
sequences of many individuals. Manual labeling is not required. Our model
enables the synthesis of random identities with controllable pose and
expression. Close-to-real-time performance is achieved.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into
generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis.
First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset
comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct
scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore,
an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images
based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the
scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.
Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,
comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning
phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism
of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to
human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by
experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning
method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

Motivation: 在部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中，同时实现搜索准确性和效率具有挑战性，因为多样化的上下文表示会增加计算和内存成本。

Method: 提出原型PRVR框架，编码多样化上下文为固定数量的原型；引入文本关联和视频理解策略；使用跨模态和单模态重建任务对齐原型与文本特征；采用视频混合技术进一步对齐原型与文本表示。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet-Captions和QVHighlights数据集上的广泛评估验证了方法的有效性且未牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了PRVR中准确性与效率的平衡问题，通过原型编码和重建任务实现了高效且准确的视频检索。

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and
efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced
in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse
context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances
accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this
dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse
contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce
several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within
the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the
prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes
searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we
implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal
reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared
space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts
during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide
weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual
representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and
QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing
efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),
aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and
blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high
resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient
motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in
LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR
and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse
information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a
reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from
intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global
scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to
enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module
that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame
events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable
alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and
7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,
code & models.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了TryOffDiff，一种基于扩散模型的VTOFF方法，用于从穿着者图像中提取标准化服装图像，并在VTON任务中优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决虚拟试穿（VTON）和虚拟试脱（VTOFF）中的挑战，特别是从穿着者图像中提取标准化服装图像的困难。

Method: 基于潜在扩散框架和SigLIP图像条件，TryOffDiff捕捉服装的纹理、形状和图案特性，并结合类别特定嵌入实现多服装VTOFF。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode数据集上取得领先性能，并优化了p2p-VTON任务，减少不必要属性转移。

Conclusion: TryOffDiff是首个多服装VTOFF模型，与VTON结合可显著提升虚拟试穿效果。

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified
garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more
challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,
lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers
multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it
improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin
color. Code is available at: https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff/

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型预训练中的可扩展标题生成技术，提出了一种低幻觉合成标题生成方法，并验证了其在预训练中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型预训练依赖高质量图像-文本对，但数据稀缺限制了发展。本文旨在通过合成标题解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种生成高质量、低幻觉合成标题的管道，并采用连续DPO方法减少幻觉。

Result: 合成标题显著提升了模型性能，在35项任务中性能提升至少6.2%，同时在文本到图像领域也表现优异。

Conclusion: 合成标题可作为真实数据的替代品，显著提升视觉语言模型性能，并发布了低幻觉数据集Hunyuan-Recap100M。

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has
experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement
of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training
paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality
image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the
availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce
and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.
This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for
vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale
low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a
viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)
achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language
models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key
contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,
low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO
methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,
the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%
to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals
that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their
counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data
achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text
pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support
in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1
on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation
benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and
knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Complex-Edit基准，用于评估基于指令的图像编辑模型在不同复杂度指令下的表现，并揭示了开源模型与闭源模型的性能差距、复杂指令对模型的影响等关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型在复杂指令下的表现缺乏系统性评估，因此需要开发一个全面的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 利用GPT-4o自动收集多样化的编辑指令，采用“Chain-of-Edit”流程生成复杂指令，并引入VLM自动评估管道。

Result: 开源模型表现显著落后于闭源模型；复杂指令影响模型保留关键元素和美学质量；分解复杂指令会降低性能；Best-of-N策略能提升结果；合成数据训练会导致编辑结果显得不自然。

Conclusion: Complex-Edit为图像编辑模型提供了系统性评估工具，揭示了复杂指令下的性能瓶颈，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across
instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness
GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale.
Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first
generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them
to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of
metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a
VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our
benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly
underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the
performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased
instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key
elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;
3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed
in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple
metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for
both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe
a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model
training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly
synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon
that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法CSegSynth，利用易获取的人口统计和认知测试信息生成个体特异性脑MRI分割，无需详细脑结构信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要详细的脑结构信息，但这些信息稀缺且昂贵。本文旨在利用易获取的数据生成高质量的脑MRI分割。

Method: 采用新型深度生成模型CSegSynth，优于现有生成模型（如C-VAE、C-GAN和C-LDM）。

Result: 生成的分割质量高，体积预测的Pearson相关系数达0.80、0.82和0.70（WM、GM、CSF）。

Conclusion: CSegSynth能有效利用易获取数据生成个体特异性脑MRI分割，优于现有方法。

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate
synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific
individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the
individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive,
and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable
of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white
matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations --
for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available
demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a
novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent
generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE),
conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent
diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic
segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the
effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume
prediction, with Pearson correlation coefficients reaching 0.80, 0.82, and 0.70
between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those
volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations,
respectively.

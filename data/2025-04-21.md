### [1] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Calculus Problem-Solving: A Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13187)
*In Hak Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决微积分微分问题上的表现，发现Chat GPT 4o表现最佳，但所有模型在概念理解和代数操作上存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在解决微积分问题上的能力，为教育应用提供参考。

Method: 采用系统性交叉评估框架，让每个模型解决由所有模型生成的问题。

Result: Chat GPT 4o成功率最高（94.71%），Meta AI最低（56.75%）。模型在概念理解和优化问题上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在程序性任务上表现优异，但在概念理解上仍需人类指导。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five leading large language
models (LLMs) - Chat GPT 4o, Copilot Pro, Gemini Advanced, Claude Pro, and Meta
AI - on their performance in solving calculus differentiation problems. The
investigation assessed these models across 13 fundamental problem types,
employing a systematic cross-evaluation framework where each model solved
problems generated by all models. Results revealed significant performance
disparities, with Chat GPT 4o achieving the highest success rate (94.71%),
followed by Claude Pro (85.74%), Gemini Advanced (84.42%), Copilot Pro
(76.30%), and Meta AI (56.75%). All models excelled at procedural
differentiation tasks but showed varying limitations with conceptual
understanding and algebraic manipulation. Notably, problems involving
increasing/decreasing intervals and optimization word problems proved most
challenging across all models. The cross-evaluation matrix revealed that Claude
Pro generated the most difficult problems, suggesting distinct capabilities
between problem generation and problem-solving. These findings have significant
implications for educational applications, highlighting both the potential and
limitations of LLMs as calculus learning tools. While they demonstrate
impressive procedural capabilities, their conceptual understanding remains
limited compared to human mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the continued
importance of human instruction for developing deeper mathematical
comprehension.

### [2] [BASIR: Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking -- A Dataset for Sector Identification and Performance Prediction Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189)
*Sohom Ghosh,Sudip Kumar Naskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种框架（BASIR），用于系统识别和排名受印度联邦预算公告影响的行业，结合多标签分类和性能排名，展示了较高的分类和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府财政政策对金融市场有显著影响，但实时分析预算对行业股票表现的影响仍缺乏系统方法。

Method: 利用1947至2025年印度联邦预算文本，构建BASIR数据集，结合精细调整的嵌入和语言模型进行行业分类和排名。

Result: 行业分类F1得分为0.605，行业排名NDCG得分为0.997，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为投资者和政策制定者提供了数据驱动的见解，填补了手动分析的空白，并公开了数据集以推动研究。

Abstract: Government fiscal policies, particularly annual union budgets, exert
significant influence on financial markets. However, real-time analysis of
budgetary impacts on sector-specific equity performance remains
methodologically challenging and largely unexplored. This study proposes a
framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from
India's Union Budget announcements. The framework addresses two core tasks: (1)
multi-label classification of excerpts from budget transcripts into 81
predefined economic sectors, and (2) performance ranking of these sectors.
Leveraging a comprehensive corpus of Indian Union Budget transcripts from 1947
to 2025, we introduce BASIR (Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking), an
annotated dataset mapping excerpts from budgetary transcripts to sectoral
impacts. Our architecture incorporates fine-tuned embeddings for sector
identification, coupled with language models that rank sectors based on their
predicted performances. Our results demonstrate 0.605 F1-score in sector
classification, and 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on
post-budget performances. The methodology enables investors and policymakers to
quantify fiscal policy impacts through structured, data-driven insights,
addressing critical gaps in manual analysis. The annotated dataset has been
released under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license to advance computational economics
research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有以英语为中心的基准在韩语金融领域的局限性，为高风险金融应用中的大语言模型提供更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 采用半自动化流程，结合GPT-4生成的提示和专家验证，构建包含金融知识、法律推理和金融毒性的问题集。

Result: 评估结果显示不同模型在任务准确性和输出安全性上存在显著差异，凸显了金融应用中推理和安全性的挑战。

Conclusion: KFinEval-Pilot为开发更安全可靠的金融AI系统提供了早期诊断工具，特别适用于韩语金融场景。

Abstract: We introduce KFinEval-Pilot, a benchmark suite specifically designed to
evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the Korean financial domain.
Addressing the limitations of existing English-centric benchmarks,
KFinEval-Pilot comprises over 1,000 curated questions across three critical
areas: financial knowledge, legal reasoning, and financial toxicity. The
benchmark is constructed through a semi-automated pipeline that combines
GPT-4-generated prompts with expert validation to ensure domain relevance and

notable performance differences across models, with trade-offs between task
accuracy and output safety across different model families. These results
highlight persistent challenges in applying LLMs to high-stakes financial
applications, particularly in reasoning and safety. Grounded in real-world
financial use cases and aligned with the Korean regulatory and linguistic
context, KFinEval-Pilot serves as an early diagnostic tool for developing safer
and more reliable financial AI systems.

### [4] [Sustainability via LLM Right-sizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13217)
*Jennifer Haase,Finn Klessascheck,Jan Mendling,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了11种专有和开源大语言模型在10种日常职业任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o性能最优但成本高，而Gemma-3和Phi-4等小模型在多数任务中表现可靠，适合成本敏感或隐私需求场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在实际部署中，何时较小、可本地部署的模型能够满足需求，而非一味追求高性能模型。

Method: 采用双LLM评估框架，自动化任务执行并标准化评估10项标准，包括输出质量、事实准确性和伦理责任。

Result: GPT-4o性能最优但成本高，小模型如Gemma-3和Phi-4在多数任务中表现可靠。任务类型影响模型效果，概念性任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 建议从追求性能最大化转向任务和情境感知的足够性评估，以更好地反映组织需求，并提供可持续的LLM部署指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly embedded in
organizational workflows. This has raised concerns over their energy
consumption, financial costs, and data sovereignty. While performance
benchmarks often celebrate cutting-edge models, real-world deployment decisions
require a broader perspective: when is a smaller, locally deployable model
"good enough"? This study offers an empirical answer by evaluating eleven
proprietary and open-weight LLMs across ten everyday occupational tasks,
including summarizing texts, generating schedules, and drafting emails and
proposals. Using a dual-LLM-based evaluation framework, we automated task
execution and standardized evaluation across ten criteria related to output
quality, factual accuracy, and ethical responsibility. Results show that GPT-4o
delivers consistently superior performance but at a significantly higher cost
and environmental footprint. Notably, smaller models like Gemma-3 and Phi-4
achieved strong and reliable results on most tasks, suggesting their viability
in contexts requiring cost-efficiency, local deployment, or privacy. A cluster
analysis revealed three model groups -- premium all-rounders, competent
generalists, and limited but safe performers -- highlighting trade-offs between
quality, control, and sustainability. Significantly, task type influenced model
effectiveness: conceptual tasks challenged most models, while aggregation and
transformation tasks yielded better performances. We argue for a shift from
performance-maximizing benchmarks to task- and context-aware sufficiency
assessments that better reflect organizational priorities. Our approach
contributes a scalable method to evaluate AI models through a sustainability
lens and offers actionable guidance for responsible LLM deployment in practice.

### [5] [DIDS: Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling for Large Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13227)
*Weijie Shi,Jipeng Zhang,Yaguang Wu,Jingzhi Fang,Ruiyuan Zhang,Jiajie Xu,Jia Zhu,Hao Chen,Yao Zhao,Sirui Han,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIDS提出了一种基于领域影响感知的数据采样方法，通过梯度聚类和FIM度量优化领域采样策略，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多领域数据集中领域采样策略对模型性能影响显著，现有方法难以保持领域内一致性和准确衡量领域影响。

Method: 使用梯度聚类算法分组数据，结合FIM度量量化领域影响，并基于损失学习轨迹确定最优采样比例。

Result: 实验表明DIDS平均性能提升3.4%，同时保持训练效率。

Conclusion: DIDS通过领域影响感知和优化采样策略，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets,
where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to
varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for
optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining
intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper,
we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain
consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data
based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and
dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To
accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)
guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the
model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees.
Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the
FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that
indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal
returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher
average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency.

### [6] [ImPart: Importance-Aware Delta-Sparsification for Improved Model Compression and Merging in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13237)
*Yan Yang,Yixia Li,Hongru Wang,Xuetao Wei,Jianqiao Yu,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ImPart是一种基于重要性感知的delta稀疏化方法，通过动态调整不同奇异向量的稀疏比例，在高稀疏比下仍能保留关键任务知识，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务专用大语言模型的增多，delta压缩成为减少资源消耗的关键方法，但现有稀疏化方法忽视参数重要性或评估粒度不足。

Method: 利用奇异值分解（SVD），动态调整不同奇异向量的稀疏比例，基于其重要性保留关键参数。

Result: 实验显示，ImPart在相同性能水平下压缩比提高2倍，并在delta量化和模型合并中达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: ImPart通过重要性感知的稀疏化方法，显著提升了delta压缩的效率与性能。

Abstract: With the proliferation of task-specific large language models, delta
compression has emerged as a method to mitigate the resource challenges of
deploying numerous such models by effectively compressing the delta model
parameters. Previous delta-sparsification methods either remove parameters
randomly or truncate singular vectors directly after singular value
decomposition (SVD). However, these methods either disregard parameter
importance entirely or evaluate it with too coarse a granularity. In this work,
we introduce ImPart, a novel importance-aware delta sparsification approach.
Leveraging SVD, it dynamically adjusts sparsity ratios of different singular
vectors based on their importance, effectively retaining crucial task-specific
knowledge even at high sparsity ratios. Experiments show that ImPart achieves
state-of-the-art delta sparsification performance, demonstrating $2\times$
higher compression ratio than baselines at the same performance level. When
integrated with existing methods, ImPart sets a new state-of-the-art on delta
quantization and model merging.

### [7] [CPG-EVAL: A Multi-Tiered Benchmark for Evaluating the Chinese Pedagogical Grammar Competence of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13261)
*Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CPG-EVAL，首个专门评估大语言模型（LLMs）在外语教学中语法能力的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLMs的兴起，其在语法教学中的能力尚未得到充分评估，因此需要专门的测试工具。

Method: CPG-EVAL包含五项任务，评估语法识别、细粒度区分、类别辨别及抗干扰能力。

Result: 小规模模型在单一任务中表现良好，但在多任务和干扰下表现不佳；大规模模型抗干扰能力更强，但仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在外语教学中的应用提供了首个理论驱动的多层级评估框架，并为未来改进模型与教育场景的适配性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT
has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical
grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the
first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of
pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction.
Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar
recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination,
and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can
succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance
tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show
better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy
improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional
alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of
LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized,
theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating
LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts.
CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and
model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational
settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model
alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed
decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非洲互联网普及率上升，年轻人对移动互联网的需求增加，但市场运营商有限，导致性价比选择受限。研究旨在了解年轻人对价格与服务的感受。

Method: 通过扫描Twitter和Facebook上与主题相关的评论，并应用情感分析模型来收集用户的普遍情绪。

Result: 情感分析结果显示年轻人对移动互联网价格与服务质量的态度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了塞内加尔年轻人对移动互联网价格与服务的普遍情绪，为市场改进提供了参考。

Abstract: Internet penetration rates in Africa are rising steadily, and mobile Internet
is getting an even bigger boost with the availability of smartphones. Young
people are increasingly using the Internet, especially social networks, and
Senegal is no exception to this revolution. Social networks have become the
main means of expression for young people. Despite this evolution in Internet
access, there are few operators on the market, which limits the alternatives
available in terms of value for money. In this paper, we will look at how young
people feel about the price of mobile Internet in Senegal, in relation to the
perceived quality of the service, through their comments on social networks. We
scanned a set of Twitter and Facebook comments related to the subject and

*Xiao Pu,Michael Saxon,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了推理模型在任务中生成过多不必要标记的问题，提出了问题难度与最优标记消耗的关系，并评估了模型的校准能力。通过DUMB500数据集和THOUGHTTERMINATOR技术，改进了模型的校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理模型在简单问题上生成过多不必要标记的问题，探索问题难度与标记消耗的关系。

Method: 引入问题难度近似度量，评估模型校准能力，提出DUMB500数据集和THOUGHTTERMINATOR解码技术。

Result: 推理模型普遍校准不佳，尤其在简单问题上；THOUGHTTERMINATOR显著改善了校准效果。

Conclusion: 问题难度与标记消耗相关，THOUGHTTERMINATOR是一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance on difficult tasks
that traditional language models struggle at. However, many are plagued with
the problem of overthinking--generating large amounts of unnecessary tokens
which don't improve accuracy on a question. We introduce approximate measures
of problem-level difficulty and demonstrate that a clear relationship between
problem difficulty and optimal token spend exists, and evaluate how well
calibrated a variety of reasoning models are in terms of efficiently allocating
the optimal token count. We find that in general, reasoning models are poorly
calibrated, particularly on easy problems. To evaluate calibration on easy
questions we introduce DUMB500, a dataset of extremely easy math, reasoning,
code, and task problems, and jointly evaluate reasoning model on these simple
examples and extremely difficult examples from existing frontier benchmarks on
the same task domain. Finally, we introduce THOUGHTTERMINATOR, a training-free
black box decoding technique that significantly improves reasoning model
calibration.

### [10] [Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425)
*Grace Byun,Shinsun Lee,Nayoung Choi,Jinho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SecMulti-RAG框架通过多源检索和本地开源生成器解决企业RAG系统的检索范围限制和数据安全问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在企业环境中因检索范围有限和数据安全风险表现不佳。

Method: SecMulti-RAG从内部文档、预生成专家知识和外部LLM生成知识中检索，并采用本地开源生成器和安全过滤机制。

Result: 在汽车行业报告生成任务中，SecMulti-RAG在正确性、丰富性和实用性上显著优于传统RAG。

Conclusion: SecMulti-RAG是企业RAG的实用且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in
enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks.
When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to
generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source
Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary
information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG
(SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but
also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for
anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate
security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize
external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This
approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In
our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry,
SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9
percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based
evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights
SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.

### [11] [D-GEN: Automatic Distractor Generation and Evaluation for Reliable Assessment of Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13439)
*Grace Byun,Jinho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-GEN是一个开源干扰项生成模型，将开放式数据转化为多选题格式，并通过排名对齐和熵分析评估干扰项质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式生成模型评估中的不一致性问题，同时减少高质量干扰项生成的时间和人力成本。

Method: 提出D-GEN模型，利用排名对齐和熵分析评估干扰项质量。

Result: D-GEN在排名一致性和熵分布上表现优异，人类评估也验证了其干扰项的流畅性和有效性。

Conclusion: D-GEN为多选题评估提供了高效、自动化的干扰项生成方法，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models with open-ended generation is challenging due to
inconsistencies in response formats. Multiple-choice (MC) evaluation mitigates
this issue, but generating high-quality distractors is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. We introduce D-GEN, the first open-source distractor generator
model that transforms open-ended data into an MC format. To evaluate distractor
quality, we propose two novel methods: (1) ranking alignment, ensuring
generated distractors retain the discriminatory power of ground-truth
distractors, and (2) entropy analysis, comparing model confidence
distributions. Our results show that D-GEN preserves ranking consistency
(Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94) and closely matches the entropy
distribution of ground-truth distractors. Human evaluation further confirms the
fluency, coherence, distractiveness, and incorrectness. Our work advances
robust and efficient distractor generation with automated evaluation, setting a
new standard for MC evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单阶段LLM部署成本高且延迟大，需要优化以实现高效部署。

Method: 通过三阶段流程：1）构建原型系统生成高质量数据；2）结合拒绝微调、强化学习和知识蒸馏将知识转移到小模型；3）通过量化和剪枝进一步压缩模型。

Result: 最终得到一个0.4B的超小模型，实现了超低延迟和成本，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计和跨领域能力表明其在其他NLP领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing
(NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred
their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours,
employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective,
this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large
model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a
three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including
prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the
cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super
tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying
the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a
function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype
system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The
second stage combine techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement
learning and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B
student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final
stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress model to 0.4B,
achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and
cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床诊断中对关键医学信息的敏感性，发现现有模型存在局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床诊断对LLMs的可靠性和敏感性要求更高，但现有研究忽视了关键信息的重要性，因此需要评估LLMs对关键医学信息的敏感性。

Method: 通过引入不同的扰动策略，评估了GPT-3.5、GPT-4、Gemini、Claude3和LLaMA2-7b等LLMs对关键医学信息的敏感性。

Result: 评估结果表明，当前LLMs在诊断决策中对关键医学信息的敏感性存在局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs的发展需聚焦于提高可靠性、增强对关键信息的敏感性，并有效利用这些信息，以提升人类信任并促进实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various domains. However, for clinical diagnosis, higher expectations are
required for LLM's reliability and sensitivity: thinking like physicians and
remaining sensitive to key medical information that affects diagnostic
reasoning, as subtle variations can lead to different diagnosis results. Yet,
existing works focus mainly on investigating the sensitivity of LLMs to
irrelevant context and overlook the importance of key information. In this
paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs, i.e. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini,
Claude3 and LLaMA2-7b, to key medical information by introducing different
perturbation strategies. The evaluation results highlight the limitations of
current LLMs in remaining sensitive to key medical information for diagnostic
decision-making. The evolution of LLMs must focus on improving their
reliability, enhancing their ability to be sensitive to key information, and
effectively utilizing this information. These improvements will enhance human
trust in LLMs and facilitate their practical application in real-world
scenarios. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“过程预判”的新策略，通过预判错误来提升LLM的推理能力，避免了单纯试错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM推理依赖试错，而人类在推理时会预判可能的错误并避免。论文旨在模拟这一行为，提升LLM的推理效率。

Method: 定义了预判节点，结合动态树搜索框架，并采用SFT和RL两阶段训练机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 过程预判策略有效提升了LLM的推理能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new \emph{process prejudge} strategy in LLM
reasoning to demonstrate that bootstrapping with process prejudge allows the
LLM to adaptively anticipate the errors encountered when advancing the
subsequent reasoning steps, similar to people sometimes pausing to think about
what mistakes may occur and how to avoid them, rather than relying solely on
trial and error. Specifically, we define a prejudge node in the rationale,
which represents a reasoning step, with at least one step that follows the
prejudge node that has no paths toward the correct answer. To synthesize the
prejudge reasoning process, we present an automated reasoning framework with a
dynamic tree-searching strategy. This framework requires only one LLM to
perform answer judging, response critiquing, prejudge generation, and thought
completion. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase training mechanism with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results from competition-level
complex reasoning demonstrate that our method can teach the model to prejudge
before thinking and significantly enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Code

Method: 结合知识图谱驱动的CoT生成、可学习的知识案例感知RAG和伪程序提示执行。

Result: 在九个公共数据集上显著提升准确性（4.0%至23.0%），并在领域特定数据集中表现出高效执行。

Conclusion: CoT-RAG具有强实用性和可扩展性，显著提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large
language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, it still has two main challenges: the
low reliability of relying solely on LLMs to generate reasoning chains and the
interference of natural language reasoning chains on the inference logic of
LLMs. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework
with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring
knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby
enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to
retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable
information; (iii) Pseudo-Program Prompting Execution, which encourages LLMs to
execute reasoning tasks in pseudo-programs with greater logical rigor. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on nine public datasets, covering three
reasoning problems. Compared with the-state-of-the-art methods, CoT-RAG
exhibits a significant accuracy improvement, ranging from 4.0% to 23.0%.
Furthermore, testing on four domain-specific datasets, CoT-RAG shows remarkable
accuracy and efficient execution, highlighting its strong practical
applicability and scalability.

Motivation: 银行客户反馈涉及多种语言（英语、僧伽罗语、混合语），现有模型对低资源语言处理能力不足且缺乏解释性。

Method: 结合XLM-RoBERTa（僧伽罗语和混合语）、BERT-base-uncased（英语），并整合领域特定词典校正，使用SHAP和LIME增强解释性。

Result: 在英语中准确率达92.3%，F1分数0.89；僧伽罗语和混合语中达88.4%。解释性分析揭示了关键情感驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多语言低资源NLP和解释性空白，为金融应用提供了透明、鲁棒的情感分析工具。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for brand reputation management in the banking
sector, where customer feedback spans English, Sinhala, Singlish, and
code-mixed text. Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like
Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a
hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual
capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews,
we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate
domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English.
The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence
scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time
sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches
outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent
accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and
code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers,
improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers
aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This
research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial
applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and
explainability.

*Yu Li,Han Jiang,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DETAM是一种无需微调的防御方法，通过修改注意力机制提升LLMs对越狱攻击的防御能力，实验表明其优于现有方法且具有强泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，越狱攻击成为安全隐患，现有防御方法泛化能力有限且可能降低模型实用性。

Method: 分析注意力分数差异，识别敏感注意力头，推理时重新分配注意力以强调用户核心意图。

Result: DETAM在防御越狱攻击上优于基线方法，泛化性强，且在实用性和过防御数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DETAM为LLMs提供了一种高效且实用的防御越狱攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak
attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While
safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they
remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on
fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited
generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a
finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities
against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification.
Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful
and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to
jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the
user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our
experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in
jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks
and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data.
Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense
datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The
code will be released immediately upon acceptance.

Result: 实验表明，RL训练的模型在泛化性能上显著优于监督微调基线，RCS和COT进一步提升了效果。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了意图检测任务的泛化能力，为部署适应性强的对话系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Intent detection, a critical component in task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, faces significant challenges in adapting to the rapid influx of
integrable tools with complex interrelationships. Existing approaches, such as
zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with
performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous
task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen
tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based
Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained
models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in
generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters
the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on
challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought
(COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent
detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging
scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks,
offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.

Motivation: 法律LLMs在应用中面临法律推理复杂、专业语言解释精确性要求高及幻觉问题等挑战，需优化领域适应策略。

Method: 通过台湾法律框架下的法律推理任务实验，评估DACP的效果。

Result: DACP增强了领域知识，但未在所有法律任务中一致提升性能，且影响模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 未来研究需优化法律AI的领域适应策略，平衡知识增强与泛化能力。

Abstract: The recent advances in Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed
the landscape of legal research and practice by automating tasks, enhancing
research precision, and supporting complex decision-making processes. However,
effectively adapting LLMs to the legal domain remains challenging due to the
complexity of legal reasoning, the need for precise interpretation of
specialized language, and the potential for hallucinations. This paper examines
the efficacy of Domain-Adaptive Continual Pre-Training (DACP) in improving the
legal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through a series of experiments on legal
reasoning tasks within the Taiwanese legal framework, we demonstrate that while
DACP enhances domain-specific knowledge, it does not uniformly improve
performance across all legal tasks. We discuss the trade-offs involved in DACP,
particularly its impact on model generalization and performance in prompt-based
tasks, and propose directions for future research to optimize domain adaptation
strategies in legal AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在长上下文环境下，通过上下文缩短技术（如OIE、共指消解和APS）提升低资源印地语系语言（如印地语、泰米尔语、泰卢固语和乌尔都语）的问答任务性能。实验表明，这些技术在不微调LLMs时平均提升语义分数4%和词级分数47%，微调后进一步提升2%。同时，上下文缩短减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文和低资源语言（如印地语系语言）对现代LLMs的问答任务构成挑战，尤其是自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题。

Method: 采用上下文缩短技术（OIE、共指消解、APS及其组合）优化问答性能，并在四种印地语系语言上验证。

Result: 上下文缩短技术显著提升语义和词级分数，减少计算开销。APS模型能高置信度识别答案段落时，相关文本得分高。但LLMs在处理非事实性问题（如推理或辩论）时仍有局限。

Conclusion: 上下文缩短技术能有效提升低资源语言问答系统的效率和性能，但需进一步改进以应对非事实性问题。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given
context, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs)
when the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is
compounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study
explores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction
(OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their
combinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of
unshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield
an average improvement of 4\% in semantic scores and 47\% in token-level scores
when evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with
fine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\% in both semantic and
token-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational
overhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS
model confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all
tokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the
study also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing
non-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate.
Moreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system
performance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening
techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems,
especially for low-resource languages. The source code and resources are
available at https://github.com/ritwikmishra/IndicGenQA.

TL;DR: ThoughtMani通过在小模型生成的外部CoT中插入思考标记，显著减少大模型的冗余推理步骤，降低计算成本，同时保持性能并提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型（LRMs）存在“过度思考”问题，即生成冗余推理步骤但性能提升有限，现有方法需额外数据和调整，且泛化性差。

Method: 提出ThoughtMani，通过在小模型生成的外部CoT中插入思考标记（<think>和</think>），引导大模型减少冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在QwQ-32B上，ThoughtMani保持性能的同时减少30%输出标记，安全性提升10%。

Conclusion: ThoughtMani为构建高效、安全的大推理模型提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of scaling test-time computation to enhance reasoning
capabilities in multiple tasks. However, LRMs typically suffer from
"overthinking" problems, where models generate significantly redundant
reasoning steps while bringing limited performance gains. Existing work relies
on fine-tuning to mitigate overthinking, which requires additional data,
unconventional training setups, risky safety misalignment, and poor
generalization.
  Through empirical analysis, we reveal an important characteristic of LRM
behaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the
thinking token ($\texttt{<think>}$ and $\texttt{</think>)}$ can effectively
manipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on these insights, we
propose a simple yet efficient pipeline, ThoughtMani, to enable LRMs to bypass
unnecessary intermediate steps and reduce computational costs significantly. We
conduct extensive experiments to validate the utility and efficiency of
ThoughtMani. For instance, when applied to QwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code
dataset, ThoughtMani keeps the original performance and reduces output token
counts by approximately 30%, with little overhead from the CoT generator.
Furthermore, we find that ThoughtMani enhances safety alignment by an average
of 10%. Since model vendors typically serve models of different sizes
simultaneously, ThoughtMani provides an effective way to construct more
efficient and accessible LRMs for real-world applications.

Conclusion: LLM推动了学术写作的趋同，但采用效果因群体而异，需关注潜在的不平等现象。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation
and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted
generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous
adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a
dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel
classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large
language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings
reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines,
gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution
in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness,
and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by
revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while
LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers,
non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic
shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established
researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MT评估中人类评分的噪声和不一致性是关键挑战，现有方法在系统级和片段级评估中存在不足。

Method: ReMedy框架将翻译评估转化为奖励建模任务，使用成对偏好数据学习相对翻译质量，而非直接回归不完美的人类评分。

Result: 在WMT22-24共享任务（39种语言对，111个MT系统）中，ReMedy-9B在片段级和系统级评估中均达到最先进水平，超越多个大型模型。

Conclusion: ReMedy在检测翻译错误和评估低质量翻译方面表现出色，为MT评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in MT evaluation is the inherent noise and inconsistency of
human ratings. Regression-based neural metrics struggle with this noise, while
prompting LLMs shows promise at system-level evaluation but performs poorly at
segment level. In this work, we propose ReMedy, a novel MT metric framework
that reformulates translation evaluation as a reward modeling task. Instead of
regressing on imperfect human ratings directly, ReMedy learns relative
translation quality using pairwise preference data, resulting in a more
reliable evaluation. In extensive experiments across WMT22-24 shared tasks (39
language pairs, 111 MT systems), ReMedy achieves state-of-the-art performance
at both segment- and system-level evaluation. Specifically, ReMedy-9B surpasses
larger WMT winners and massive closed LLMs such as MetricX-13B,
XCOMET-Ensemble, GEMBA-GPT-4, PaLM-540B, and finetuned PaLM2. Further analyses
demonstrate that ReMedy delivers superior capability in detecting translation
errors and evaluating low-quality translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话策略规划方法常忽略用户特性，而实际场景（如对话搜索和推荐）中用户特征至关重要。

Method: UDP框架分三阶段：用户画像动态推断、用户反馈预测、用户定制策略规划，并结合主动学习优化训练。

Result: 实验表明UDP在协作和非协作场景中均能有效学习用户特定策略，验证了其鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: UDP框架通过用户特性建模和反馈预测，推动了用户中心对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have emphasized optimizing
system agent policies to achieve predefined goals, focusing on strategy design,
trajectory acquisition, and efficient training paradigms. However, these
approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are
essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and
recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as
personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a
comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically
assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging
realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant
limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored
dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the
User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an
Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in
three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to
dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a
Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3)
User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response
strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning
approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training.
Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and
non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning
user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and
highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric
dialogue systems.

Conclusion: 特定词嵌入模型（如BERT）结合PCA可显著提升文本分类性能，为电信服务改进提供有效工具。

Abstract: Telecom services are at the core of today's societies' everyday needs. The
availability of numerous online forums and discussion platforms enables telecom
providers to improve their services by exploring the views of their customers
to learn about common issues that the customers face. Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools can be used to process the free text collected.
  One way of working with such data is to represent text as numerical vectors
using one of many word embedding models based on neural networks. This research
uses a novel dataset of telecom customers' reviews to perform an extensive
study showing how different word embedding algorithms can affect the text
classification process. Several state-of-the-art word embedding techniques are
considered, including BERT, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, coupled with several
classification algorithms. The important issue of feature engineering and
dimensionality reduction is addressed and several PCA-based approaches are
explored. Moreover, the energy consumption used by the different word
embeddings is investigated. The findings show that some word embedding models
can lead to consistently better text classifiers in terms of precision, recall
and F1-Score. In particular, for the more challenging classification tasks,
BERT combined with PCA stood out with the highest performance metrics.
Moreover, our proposed PCA approach of combining word vectors using the first
principal component shows clear advantages in performance over the traditional
approach of taking the average.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems enable natural language conversations and
thus lead to a more engaging and effective recommendation scenario. As the
conversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual
information, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate
external sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine
different types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper,
we propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called
MCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via
mixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS
incorporates both structured information and unstructured information,
including the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history,
and unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert
specialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information).
Multiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final
results. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual
information and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot
breaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly
higher performance compared to existing baselines.

Motivation: 提升语言模型的安全性和可靠性需要准确的不确定性量化（UQ）评估，但现有评估方法因正确性函数的长度偏差而失真。

Method: 评估了7种正确性函数（包括基于词汇、嵌入和LLM-as-a-judge的方法）在4个数据集、4个模型和6种UQ方法中的表现。

Result: 发现正确性函数的长度偏差与UQ方法的长度偏差相互作用，导致评估失真；LLM-as-a-judge方法偏差最小。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-judge方法可作为减少评估偏差的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for
improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance
metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence
probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In
this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ
evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7
correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to
LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our
analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness
functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ
methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased
choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

Result: 应用于20,000多篇关于人类迁移的科学文章，证明领域适应的LLM能准确选择相关研究、检测趋势并识别研究空白。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了微调LLMs在多学科文献综述中的潜力，可加速知识合成和科学发现。

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid framework for literature reviews that augments
traditional bibliometric methods with large language models (LLMs). By
fine-tuning open-source LLMs, our approach enables scalable extraction of
qualitative insights from large volumes of research content, enhancing both the
breadth and depth of knowledge synthesis. To improve annotation efficiency and
consistency, we introduce an error-focused validation process in which LLMs
generate initial labels and human reviewers correct misclassifications.
Applying this framework to over 20000 scientific articles about human
migration, we demonstrate that a domain-adapted LLM can serve as a "specialist"
model - capable of accurately selecting relevant studies, detecting emerging
trends, and identifying critical research gaps. Notably, the LLM-assisted
review reveals a growing scholarly interest in climate-induced migration.
However, existing literature disproportionately centers on a narrow set of
environmental hazards (e.g., floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and land
degradation), while overlooking others that more directly affect human health
and well-being, such as air and water pollution or infectious diseases. This
imbalance highlights the need for more comprehensive research that goes beyond
physical environmental changes to examine their ecological and societal
consequences, particularly in shaping migration as an adaptive response.
Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs
to conduct more efficient, consistent, and insightful literature reviews across
disciplines, ultimately accelerating knowledge synthesis and scientific
discovery.

multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled
dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using
prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military
operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based
model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision
improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that
LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and
support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams. Our code is

Abstract: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great
success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic
consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce
LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic
consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert
experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack
performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack
based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models
(BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a
refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to
refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification
agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial
prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text
and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the
refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct
extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two
defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic
consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are
applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.

Abstract: While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent
hallucination, research on knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly
focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how
LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their
internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in
multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs'
perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper
layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge
boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of
a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary
perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk
in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair
translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across
languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge
boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising
three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets
are publicly available at

Abstract: The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I"
of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive
parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations in knowledge
latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this
era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling
dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the
emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from
knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines
through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a
mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper,
we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why
this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these
advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized
implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling
every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly
updated collection of papers on test-time scaling in the GitHub Repository:

Result: 该方法在质量和速度上优于依赖LLM提示的方法，提升了文献探索的效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY为科学文献探索提供了结构化途径，支持趋势发现和跨学科研究。

Abstract: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it challenging to track
progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While
existing tools like citation networks and search engines make it easy to access
a few related papers, they fundamentally lack the flexible abstraction needed
to represent the density of activity in various scientific subfields. We
motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature
into a high-quality hierarchical structure that allows for the categorization
of scientific work across varying levels of abstraction, from very broad fields
to very specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which
fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve the goals of
SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, we develop a range of algorithms. Our primary approach
combines fast embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting to balance
the computational efficiency of embedding methods with the semantic precision
offered by LLM prompting. We demonstrate that this approach offers the best
trade-off between quality and speed compared to methods that heavily rely on
LLM prompting, such as iterative tree construction with LLMs. To better reflect
the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of research papers, our hierarchy
captures multiple dimensions of categorization beyond simple topic labels. We
evaluate the utility of our framework by assessing how effectively an LLM-based
agent can locate target papers using the hierarchy. Results show that this
structured approach enhances interpretability, supports trend discovery, and
offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond
traditional search methods. Code, data and demo:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅关注实例质量并使用启发式规则保持多样性，缺乏对数据集的全面视角，导致结果次优。启发式规则在嵌入空间中难以准确捕捉复杂指令的语义意图。

Method: 构建标签图建模语义空间，量化信息分布以衡量多样性，提出MIG采样方法迭代选择数据样本以最大化语义空间信息增益。

Result: 实验表明MIG在多个数据集和基础模型上优于现有方法，仅用5%数据训练的模型性能接近全数据集训练的官方SFT模型，在AlpacaEval和Wildbench上分别提升5.73%和6.89%。

Conclusion: MIG方法通过量化语义空间信息内容并优化采样策略，显著提升了指令调优数据集的质量和多样性，为高效数据选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data quality and diversity are key to the construction of effective
instruction-tuning datasets. % With the increasing availability of open-source
instruction-tuning datasets, it is advantageous to automatically select
high-quality and diverse subsets from a vast amount of data. % Existing methods
typically prioritize instance quality and use heuristic rules to maintain
diversity. % However, this absence of a comprehensive view of the entire
collection often leads to suboptimal results. % Moreover, heuristic rules
generally focus on distance or clustering within the embedding space, which
fails to accurately capture the intent of complex instructions in the semantic
space. % To bridge this gap, we propose a unified method for quantifying the
information content of datasets. This method models the semantic space by
constructing a label graph and quantifies diversity based on the distribution
of information within the graph. % Based on such a measurement, we further
introduce an efficient sampling method that selects data samples iteratively to
\textbf{M}aximize the \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{G}ain (MIG) in semantic
space. % Experiments on various datasets and base models demonstrate that MIG
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. % Notably, the model
fine-tuned with 5\% Tulu3 data sampled by MIG achieves comparable performance
to the official SFT model trained on the full dataset, with improvements of
+5.73\% on AlpacaEval and +6.89\% on Wildbench.

dynamics within LLMs. The goal is to justify that a quantum-inspired framework
is a valid approach to studying semantic spaces. This framework offers valuable
insights into their information processing and response generation, and we
further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop
significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.

Abstract: Causality and game theory are two influential fields that contribute
significantly to decision-making in various domains. Causality defines and
models causal relationships in complex policy problems, while game theory
provides insights into strategic interactions among stakeholders with competing
interests. Integrating these frameworks has led to significant theoretical
advancements with the potential to improve decision-making processes. However,
practical applications of these developments remain underexplored. To support
efforts toward implementation, this paper clarifies key concepts in game theory
and causality that are essential to their intersection, particularly within the
context of probabilistic graphical models. By rigorously examining these
concepts and illustrating them with intuitive, consistent examples, we clarify
the required inputs for implementing these models, provide practitioners with
insights into their application and selection across different scenarios, and
reference existing research that supports their implementation. We hope this
work encourages broader adoption of these models in real-world scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，Causal-Copilot性能优于现有基线，提供了可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: Causal-Copilot通过降低使用门槛和整合先进方法，推动了因果分析的实际应用与理论发展。

Abstract: Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and
reliable decision-making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts
due to its conceptual and algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between
causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain
experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal
researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods.
To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that
operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model
framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for
both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal
inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result
interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive
refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists
while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art
causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding
access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich,
real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance
compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible
solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world
applicability in causal analysis.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI systems in the economy hinges on their ability
to generate economic value that outweighs their inference costs. Evaluating
this tradeoff requires metrics that account for both performance and costs. We
propose a framework grounded in production theory for evaluating language
models by combining accuracy and inference cost. We introduce "cost-of-pass",
the expected monetary cost of generating a correct solution. We then define the
"frontier cost-of-pass" as the minimum cost-of-pass achievable across available
models or the "human-expert, using the approximate cost of hiring an expert.
Our analysis reveals distinct economic insights. First, lightweight models are
most cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for
knowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative
problems, despite higher per-token costs. Second, tracking this frontier
cost-of-pass over the past year reveals significant progress, particularly for
complex quantitative tasks where the cost has roughly halved every few months.
Third, to trace key innovations driving this progress, we examine
counterfactual frontiers: estimates of cost-efficiency without specific model
classes. We find that innovations in lightweight, large, and reasoning models
have been essential for pushing the frontier in basic quantitative,
knowledge-intensive, and complex quantitative tasks, respectively. Finally, we
assess the cost-reductions afforded by common inference-time techniques like
majority voting and self-refinement, finding that their marginal accuracy gains
rarely justify their costs. Our findings underscore that complementary
model-level innovations are the primary drivers of cost-efficiency, and our
economic framework provides a principled tool for measuring this progress and
guiding deployment.

Abstract: Decentralized AI agent networks, such as Gaia, allows individuals to run

However, in order to maintain service quality, the network must verify that
individual nodes are running their designated LLMs. In this paper, we
demonstrate that in a cluster of mostly honest nodes, we can detect nodes that
run unauthorized or incorrect LLM through social consensus of its peers. We
will discuss the algorithm and experimental data from the Gaia network. We will
also discuss the intersubjective validation system, implemented as an
EigenLayer AVS to introduce financial incentives and penalties to encourage
honest behavior from LLM nodes.

we develop a data-driven system based on existing EV trips in New South Wales

geographical feasibility of recommended charging stations. Our system
integrates data sources including EV trip data, geographical data such as route
data and Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries, as well as features like fire

intuitively demonstrate the findings from our data-driven, multi-source fusion
system, and evaluate them through case studies. The outcome of this work can
provide a platform for discussion to develop new insights that could be used to

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance
rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed
aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown
environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single
UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the
limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots
(GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling
through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide
computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the
multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration
optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective
is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring
system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov
optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability
constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an
algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a
generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a
method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting
with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent
deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment
decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant
improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system
stability compared to baseline methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MMKGs数量不足且构建面临挑战，尤其是图像选择的质量和相关性。

Method: 设计了VSNS方法，包含VNS和SNS模块，分别过滤难可视化关系和选择结构特征邻居。

Result: 在MKG-Y和DB15K数据集上实验表明，VSNS方法生成的图像质量更高且更相关。

Conclusion: VSNS方法有效提升了多模态知识图谱的图像质量和上下文相关性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) have been widely applied across various
domains for knowledge representation. However, the existing MMKGs are
significantly fewer than required, and their construction faces numerous
challenges, particularly in ensuring the selection of high-quality,
contextually relevant images for knowledge graph enrichment. To address these
challenges, we present a framework for constructing MMKGs from conventional
KGs. Furthermore, to generate higher-quality images that are more relevant to
the context in the given knowledge graph, we designed a neighbor selection
method called Visualizable Structural Neighbor Selection (VSNS). This method
consists of two modules: Visualizable Neighbor Selection (VNS) and Structural
Neighbor Selection (SNS). The VNS module filters relations that are difficult
to visualize, while the SNS module selects neighbors that most effectively
capture the structural characteristics of the entity. To evaluate the quality
of the generated images, we performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations
on two datasets, MKG-Y and DB15K. The experimental results indicate that using
the VSNS method to select neighbors results in higher-quality images that are
more relevant to the knowledge graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在概率推理中的表现，以确保其在信息检索和自动决策系统中的可信度与可解释性。

Method: 引入一个包含不确定真值声明的新数据集，并应用多种不确定性量化技术评估LLMs的概率推理能力。

Result: 当前LLMs无法满足概率推理的基本性质，表现不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在概率推理方面仍需改进，以实现更可信和有效的应用。

Abstract: Advances in the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led
to their use for information retrieval, and as components in automated decision
systems. A faithful representation of probabilistic reasoning in these models
may be essential to ensure trustworthy, explainable and effective performance
in these tasks. Despite previous work suggesting that LLMs can perform complex
reasoning and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification, we find that current
versions of this class of model lack the ability to provide rational and
coherent representations of probabilistic beliefs. To demonstrate this, we
introduce a novel dataset of claims with indeterminate truth values and apply a
number of well-established techniques for uncertainty quantification to measure
the ability of LLM's to adhere to fundamental properties of probabilistic
reasoning.

TL;DR: OpenDeception是一个新颖的欺骗评估框架，用于评估基于LLM的代理的欺骗意图和能力，揭示了主流LLM的高欺骗风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升和代理应用的普及，其潜在的欺骗风险亟需系统评估和有效监管。

Method: 通过构建开放场景数据集和模拟多轮对话，OpenDeception评估LLM的欺骗意图和能力，并避免与人类测试者的高风险互动。

Result: 评估显示，主流LLM的欺骗意图比例超过80%，成功率超过50%，且能力更强的LLM欺骗风险更高。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁加强对LLM欺骗行为的抑制和对齐努力。

Abstract: As the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve and agent
applications become more widespread, the underlying deception risks urgently
require systematic evaluation and effective oversight. Unlike existing
evaluation which uses simulated games or presents limited choices, we introduce
OpenDeception, a novel deception evaluation framework with an open-ended
scenario dataset. OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention
and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning
process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs
intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete
scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk
deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the
multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven
mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address
deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception
intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate
surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do
exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on
inhibiting deceptive behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR（可验证奖励的强化学习）被认为能提升LLMs的推理能力，但研究发现其并未带来新的推理模式，而是通过偏向高奖励路径提升效率。蒸馏能真正引入新知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估RLVR是否真的能通过强化学习让LLMs获得超越基础模型的新推理能力。

Method: 通过测量大k值下的pass@k指标，分析不同模型家族和基准中的推理能力边界。

Result: RL训练未带来新推理模式，基础模型在大k值下表现相当或更好。RL仅通过偏向高奖励路径提升效率。

Conclusion: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力上存在局限性，需重新思考RL训练的作用及寻找更好的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently
demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that
RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning
abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,
however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the
pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning
capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and
benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally
new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at
smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or
even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$
values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included
in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning
abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.
Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the
model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,
therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in
a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar
results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we
find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,
different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in
advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink
the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模态增量学习（MIL）范式，旨在解决模型在连续演变的模态序列中增量学习的挑战。通过Harmony框架，实现了模态对齐和知识保留，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中数据常来自全新模态，而现有研究多关注单模态或模态一致的多模态增量学习。本文探索了在连续演变模态序列中统一模型增量学习的可行性。

Method: 提出Harmony框架，包含自适应兼容特征调制和累积模态桥接，通过历史模态特征构建和模态知识积累与对齐，减少模态差异并保留知识。

Result: 实验表明，Harmony在MIL任务中显著优于现有增量学习方法。

Conclusion: Harmony框架有效解决了模态增量学习中的挑战，为统一模型在多模态增量学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously acquire knowledge
from evolving data streams while preserving previously learned capabilities.
While current research predominantly focuses on unimodal incremental learning
and multimodal incremental learning where the modalities are consistent,
real-world scenarios often present data from entirely new modalities, posing
additional challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a
unified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving
modal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality
Incremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from
distinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named
Harmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling
the model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct
modalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a
unified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature
modulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal
features and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the
proposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain
knowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning
phase.These components work in concert to establish effective modality
connections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is
available at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing
incremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 当前视觉AI模型的扩展规律主要关注大规模预训练，而忽略了数据受限下游任务的性能扩展问题。

Method: 通过系统分析不同数据规模（1K-1M样本）的视觉任务，提出蒸馏边界理论，研究知识蒸馏在数据受限条件下的效率。

Result: 发现数据稀缺时蒸馏模型显著优于非蒸馏模型，而预训练数据超过临界阈值后非蒸馏模型逐渐占优。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了大规模预训练与下游任务适应之间的知识空白，为资源优化分配提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Current scaling laws for visual AI models focus predominantly on large-scale
pretraining, leaving a critical gap in understanding how performance scales for
data-constrained downstream tasks. To address this limitation, this paper
establishes the first practical framework for data-efficient scaling laws in
visual transfer learning, addressing two fundamental questions: 1) How do
scaling behaviors shift when downstream tasks operate with limited data? 2)
What governs the efficacy of knowledge distillation under such constraints?
Through systematic analysis of vision tasks across data regimes (1K-1M
samples), we propose the distillation boundary theory, revealing a critical
turning point in distillation efficiency: 1) Distillation superiority: In
data-scarce conditions, distilled models significantly outperform their
non-distillation counterparts, efficiently leveraging inherited knowledge to
compensate for limited training samples. 2) Pre-training dominance: As
pre-training data increases beyond a critical threshold, non-distilled models
gradually surpass distilled versions, suggesting diminishing returns from
knowledge inheritance when sufficient task-specific data becomes available.
Empirical validation across various model scales (2.5M to 38M parameters) and
data volumes demonstrate these performance inflection points, with error
difference curves transitioning from positive to negative values at critical
data thresholds, confirming our theoretical predictions. This work redefines
scaling laws for data-limited regimes, bridging the knowledge gap between
large-scale pretraining and practical downstream adaptation, addressing a
critical barrier to understanding vision model scaling behaviors and optimizing
computational resource allocation.

Motivation: 传统均值场博弈论依赖解析方法，可能导致解的唯一性或存在性问题，且易受建模偏差影响。

Method: 结合均值场博弈论与神经常微分方程，利用自动微分构建数据驱动模型。

Result: 模型在三种不同复杂度的均值场博弈中表现出高效性和灵活性，能通过少量观测学习数据分布。

Conclusion: 该模型轻量、灵活且鲁棒，适用于复杂战略交互的建模。

Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that would otherwise
have been intractable to model. While the games can be solved analytically via
the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free,
can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions and may suffer
from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game,
we combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural
ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven,
lightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to
capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on
automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches
based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our
approach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity,
observability and the presence of noise. Using these results, we show that the
model is flexible, lightweight and requires few observations to learn the
distribution underlying the data.

TL;DR: PSG-MAE是一种基于掩码自编码器的预训练框架，通过自监督学习提取多通道PSG信号的时空特征，提升睡眠事件监测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度神经网络在睡眠监测中因数据有限导致的泛化能力差和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 提出PSG-MAE框架，结合多通道掩码生成、信号重建和通道间对比学习策略，自监督学习提取特征。

Result: 在睡眠分期和阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停检测任务中分别达到83.7%和90.45%的准确率。

Conclusion: PSG-MAE能有效提取多通道PSG信号的时空特征，具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Polysomnography (PSG) signals are essential for studying sleep processes and
diagnosing sleep disorders. Analyzing PSG data through deep neural networks
(DNNs) for automated sleep monitoring has become increasingly feasible.
However, the limited availability of datasets for certain sleep events often
leads to DNNs focusing on a single task with a single-sourced training dataset.
As a result, these models struggle to transfer to new sleep events and lack
robustness when applied to new datasets. To address these challenges, we
propose PSG-MAE, a mask autoencoder (MAE) based pre-training framework. By
performing self-supervised learning on a large volume of unlabeled PSG data,
PSG-MAE develops a robust feature extraction network that can be broadly
applied to various sleep event monitoring tasks. Unlike conventional MAEs,
PSG-MAE generates complementary masks across PSG channels, integrates a
multichannel signal reconstruction method, and employs a self-supervised
inter-channel contrastive learning (ICCL) strategy. This approach enables the
encoder to capture temporal features from each channel while simultaneously
learning latent relationships between channels, thereby enhancing the
utilization of multichannel information. Experimental results show that PSG-MAE
effectively captures both temporal details and inter-channel information from
PSG signals. When the encoder pre-trained through PSG-MAE is fine-tuned with
downstream feature decomposition networks, it achieves an accuracy of 83.7% for
sleep staging and 90.45% for detecting obstructive sleep apnea, which
highlights the framework's robustness and broad applicability.

<details>

Motivation: 多普勒超声信号（DUS）在胎儿健康监测中具有潜力，但缺乏大规模数据集和机器学习技术的支持。

Method: 使用基于扩张因果卷积的神经时间网络，直接在波形级别建模信号的长短期依赖关系。

Result: Auto-FEDUS在时间和频域评估中优于传统生成模型，生成的信号质量高，心率估计结果与真实数据接近。

Conclusion: Auto-FEDUS为DUS数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型的训练效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fetal health monitoring through one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (DUS)
signals offers a cost-effective and accessible approach that is increasingly
gaining interest. Despite its potential, the development of machine learning
based techniques to assess the health condition of mothers and fetuses using
DUS signals remains limited. This scarcity is primarily due to the lack of
extensive DUS datasets with a reliable reference for interpretation and data
imbalance across different gestational ages. In response, we introduce a novel
autoregressive generative model designed to map fetal electrocardiogram (FECG)
signals to corresponding DUS waveforms (Auto-FEDUS). By leveraging a neural
temporal network based on dilated causal convolutions that operate directly on
the waveform level, the model effectively captures both short and long-range
dependencies within the signals, preserving the integrity of generated data.
Cross-subject experiments demonstrate that Auto-FEDUS outperforms conventional
generative architectures across both time and frequency domain evaluations,
producing DUS signals that closely resemble the morphology of their real
counterparts. The realism of these synthesized signals was further gauged using
a quality assessment model, which classified all as good quality, and a heart
rate estimation model, which produced comparable results for generated and real
data, with a Bland-Altman limit of 4.5 beats per minute. This advancement
offers a promising solution for mitigating limited data availability and
enhancing the training of DUS-based fetal models, making them more effective
and generalizable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着迁移学习模型和数据集的扩大，高效适应和存储优化成为关键需求。现有核心集选择方法主要依赖实例级难度评估，忽略了类别级特性，导致少数类别代表性不足。

Method: NUCS框架结合类别级和实例级标准，自动为每个类别分配数据选择预算，并在最优难度范围内自适应选择样本。

Result: 在14个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，NUCS显著优于现有方法，在CIFAR100和Food101上仅保留30%样本即可匹配全数据训练精度，计算时间减少60%。

Conclusion: NUCS强调了类别难度在核心集选择中的重要性，为迁移学习提供了高效且数据鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: As transfer learning models and datasets grow larger, efficient adaptation
and storage optimization have become critical needs. Coreset selection
addresses these challenges by identifying and retaining the most informative
samples, constructing a compact subset for target domain training. However,
current methods primarily rely on instance-level difficulty assessments,
overlooking crucial category-level characteristics and consequently
under-representing minority classes. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Non-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection (NUCS), a novel framework that
integrates both class-level and instance-level criteria. NUCS automatically
allocates data selection budgets for each class based on intrinsic category
difficulty and adaptively selects samples within optimal difficulty ranges. By
explicitly incorporating category-specific insights, our approach achieves a
more balanced and representative coreset, addressing key shortcomings of prior
methods. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates the rationale behind
adaptive budget allocation and sample selection, while extensive experiments
across 14 diverse datasets and model architectures demonstrate NUCS's
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior
accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, on CIFAR100 and Food101, NUCS
matches full-data training accuracy while retaining just 30% of samples and
reducing computation time by 60%. Our work highlights the importance of
characterizing category difficulty in coreset selection, offering a robust and
data-efficient solution for transfer learning.

Such an approach shifts the burden of deciding where to compute and when to

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for
counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like
cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in
recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch
sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their
applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function
governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper
bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential
second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading
to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that
RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard
and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our
proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

Conclusion: PP-GNNs在效率、扩展性和准确性上具有潜力，优化方法显著提升了其性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning node embeddings in
graphs, typically adopting a message-passing scheme. This approach, however,
leads to the neighbor explosion problem, with exponentially growing
computational and memory demands as layers increase. Graph sampling has become
the predominant method for scaling GNNs to large graphs, mitigating but not
fully solving the issue. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) represent a new class
of models that decouple feature propagation from training through
pre-processing, addressing neighbor explosion in theory. Yet, their practical
advantages and system-level optimizations remain underexplored. This paper
provides a comprehensive characterization of PP-GNNs, comparing them with
graph-sampling-based methods in training efficiency, scalability, and accuracy.
While PP-GNNs achieve comparable accuracy, we identify data loading as the key
bottleneck for training efficiency and input expansion as a major scalability
challenge. To address these issues, we propose optimized data loading schemes
and tailored training methods that improve PP-GNN training throughput by an
average of 15$\times$ over the PP-GNN baselines, with speedup of up to 2 orders
of magnitude compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph benchmarks. Our
implementation is publicly available at

Result: 在合成任务和实际任务中，GrokTransfer成功消除了延迟泛化现象。

Conclusion: GrokTransfer是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著改善神经网络的训练动态和泛化性能。

Abstract: ''Grokking'' is a phenomenon where a neural network first memorizes training
data and generalizes poorly, but then suddenly transitions to near-perfect
generalization after prolonged training. While intriguing, this delayed
generalization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally,
models should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper
proposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking
in training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding
plays a crucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed.
GrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but
far from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this
weaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target,
stronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed
generalization always occurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the
target model to generalize directly without delay. Moreover, we demonstrate
that, across empirical studies of different tasks, GrokTransfer effectively
reshapes the training dynamics and eliminates delayed generalization, for both
fully-connected neural networks and Transformers.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their
complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings.
Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency
analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance.
When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk
network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a
component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate
individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted
pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on
a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance
degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs
efficiently.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能快速训练深度自编码器并降低泛化误差。

Conclusion: 提出的随机HF优化方法结合LSMR和小批量选择算法，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Hessian-free (HF) optimization has been shown to effectively train deep
autoencoders (Martens, 2010). In this paper, we aim to accelerate HF training
of autoencoders by reducing the amount of data used in training. HF utilizes
the conjugate gradient algorithm to estimate update directions. Instead, we
propose using the LSMR method, which is known for effectively solving large
sparse linear systems. We also incorporate Chapelle & Erhan (2011)'s improved
preconditioner for HF optimization. In addition, we introduce a new mini-batch
selection algorithm to mitigate overfitting. Our algorithm starts with a small
subset of the training data and gradually increases the mini-batch size based
on (i) variance estimates obtained during the computation of a mini-batch
gradient (Byrd et al., 2012) and (ii) the relative decrease in objective value
for the validation data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
stochastic Hessian-free optimization, using the LSMR method and the new sample
selection algorithm, leads to rapid training of deep autoencoders with improved
generalization error.

TL;DR: 利用可穿戴设备预测抑郁症亚型（单极和双极抑郁），通过生理和行为信号识别生物标志物，提升诊断精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多采用二元分类（健康与抑郁），无法捕捉抑郁症的异质性，需更精准的亚型分类方法。

Method: 引入CALYPSO数据集，利用生理和行为信号（如血容量脉冲、皮肤电活动等），结合机器学习方法进行亚型分类。

Result: 初步结果显示，加速度计数据的身体活动特征区分效果最佳（准确率96.77%），体温特征次之（93.55%）。

Conclusion: 生理和行为监测有望改善抑郁症亚型分类，为个性化治疗提供支持。

Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of
observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective
assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive,
and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights
into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most
existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed
individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the
heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable
devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar
depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this
end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of
depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral
signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body
temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a
benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine
learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to
physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in
distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy
of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power,
reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of
physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of
depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式物理系统的测量数据通常稀疏且噪声大，传统方法难以处理未知动态方程和噪声分离问题。

Method: 采用储层计算技术，结合超参数优化和节点剪枝，处理噪声并重建动态。

Result: 在Lorenz吸引子和AdEx系统中，RC方法在低信噪比和高频范围内表现优于扩展卡尔曼滤波器（EKF）。

Conclusion: RC方法在噪声过滤和动态重建方面具有潜力，尤其在复杂非线性系统中表现优异。

Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and
noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are
required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from
limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because
the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in
practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently
simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation
graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the
potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the
primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents
a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics,
offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization.
The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content,
and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative
examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive
exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising
performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing
reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the
leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge
regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good
generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from
the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the
presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.

Motivation: 发现当前Dual-RL方法未能正确估计最优判别器权重，提出IDRL以迭代逼近最优分布比例。

Method: IDRL通过迭代移除低权重次优转移并运行Dual-RL，逐步优化分布比例。

Result: 在多种离线数据集上，IDRL在性能和稳定性上均优于Primal-RL和Dual-RL基线。

Conclusion: IDRL通过迭代优化判别器权重，显著提升了离线强化学习的性能与稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce Iterative Dual Reinforcement Learning (IDRL), a new method that
takes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation view of solving RL. Our
method is motivated by a simple experiment in which we find training a
discriminator using the offline dataset plus an additional expert dataset and
then performing discriminator-weighted behavior cloning gives strong results on
various types of datasets. That optimal discriminator weight is quite similar
to the learned visitation distribution ratio in Dual-RL, however, we find that
current Dual-RL methods do not correctly estimate that ratio. In IDRL, we
propose a correction method to iteratively approach the optimal visitation
distribution ratio in the offline dataset given no addtional expert dataset.
During each iteration, IDRL removes zero-weight suboptimal transitions using
the learned ratio from the previous iteration and runs Dual-RL on the remaining
subdataset. This can be seen as replacing the behavior visitation distribution
with the optimized visitation distribution from the previous iteration, which
theoretically gives a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios
that are closer to the optimal discriminator weight. We verify the
effectiveness of IDRL on various kinds of offline datasets, including D4RL
datasets and more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL beats strong
Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines in terms of both performance and stability, on
all datasets.

Motivation: 减少语言模型对特定文本的记忆，同时避免模型性能的显著下降，是当前研究的挑战。

Result: 在MUSE基准测试中，该方法在部分指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合均值教师和NLUL的方法在减少记忆的同时保持了模型性能，为解决遗忘问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: One of the goals of language model unlearning is to reduce memorization of
selected text instances while retaining the model's general abilities. Despite
various proposed methods, reducing memorization of large datasets without
noticeable degradation in model utility remains challenging. In this paper, we
investigate the mean teacher algorithm (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), a simple
proximal optimization method from continual learning literature that gradually
modifies the teacher model. We show that the mean teacher can approximate a
trajectory of a slow natural gradient descent (NGD), which inherently seeks
low-curvature updates that are less likely to degrade the model utility. While
slow NGD can suffer from vanishing gradients, we introduce a new unlearning
loss called "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) that avoids this problem. We
show that the combination of mean teacher and NLUL improves some metrics on the
MUSE benchmarks (Shi et al., 2024).

Abstract: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate
expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods
often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the
inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between
training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based
imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which
addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through
multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior
cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution
shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution.
Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and
error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据创建者和基准测试管理者担心其专有数据未经许可或归属被用于LLM训练，需要一种方法来检测数据是否被包含在预训练数据中。

Method: STAMP框架通过生成带唯一密钥水印的多个改写版本，公开一个版本并保留其他版本，随后通过配对统计测试比较公开和私有版本的模型似然性来验证数据成员资格。

Conclusion: STAMP不仅能有效检测数据成员资格，还能保留原始数据的语义和实用性，适用于实际场景如论文摘要和博客文章的检测。

Abstract: Given how large parts of publicly available text are crawled to pretrain
large language models (LLMs), data creators increasingly worry about the
inclusion of their proprietary data for model training without attribution or
licensing. Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets
might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for
detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in
the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our
proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a
watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly,
while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model
likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests
to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect
contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training
data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several
contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP
preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in
comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to
confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining
corpora.

Result: ECO框架减少了对高保真数据的依赖，数据收集成本降低两个数量级，适用于材料建模等物理问题。

Conclusion: ECO为资源高效的代理建模提供了新途径，且易于推广到其他物理问题。

Abstract: Neural surrogate solvers can estimate solutions to partial differential
equations in physical problems more efficiently than standard numerical
methods, but require extensive high-resolution training data. In this paper, we
break this limitation; we introduce a framework for super-resolution learning
in solid mechanics problems. Our approach allows one to train a high-resolution
neural network using only low-resolution data. Our Equilibrium Conserving
Operator (ECO) architecture embeds known physics directly into the network to
make up for missing high-resolution information during training. We evaluate
this ECO-based super-resolution framework that strongly enforces
conservation-laws in the predicted solutions on two working examples: embedded
pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials.
ECO eliminates the reliance on high-fidelity data and reduces the upfront cost
of data collection by two orders of magnitude, offering a robust pathway for
resource-efficient surrogate modeling in materials modeling. ECO is readily
generalizable to other physics-based problems.

Result: 发现过度聚合不仅引入冗余信息，还是过平滑的根本原因。

Conclusion: 揭示了GCN中过平滑问题的根源，为未来改进提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity
for their exceptional ability to process graph-structured data. Existing
GCN-based approaches typically employ a shallow model architecture due to the
over-smoothing phenomenon. Current approaches to mitigating over-smoothing
primarily involve adding supplementary components to GCN architectures, such as
residual connections and random edge-dropping strategies. However, these
improvements toward deep GCNs have achieved only limited success. In this work,
we analyze the intrinsic message passing mechanism of GCNs and identify a
critical issue: messages originating from high-order neighbors must traverse
through low-order neighbors to reach the target node. This repeated reliance on
low-order neighbors leads to redundant information aggregation, a phenomenon we
term over-aggregation. Our analysis demonstrates that over-aggregation not only
introduces significant redundancy but also serves as the fundamental cause of
over-smoothing in GCNs.

Motivation: 由于图在现实应用中的重要性及其高安全性需求，提升GNN检测OOD数据的能力成为迫切问题。现有方法GNNSAFE因分数无界和逻辑偏移易受极端值影响。

Method: 提出NODESAFE，通过添加两个优化项使负能量分数有界并缓解逻辑偏移，减少极端分数的生成。

Result: 实验显示，NODESAFE显著提升OOD检测能力，例如在结构操纵场景下，FPR95指标较当前最优方法降低28.4%（无OOD数据暴露）和22.7%（有OOD数据暴露）。

Conclusion: NODESAFE通过优化分数边界和逻辑偏移，有效提升了GNN在节点级别检测OOD数据的准确性。

Abstract: Given the critical role of graphs in real-world applications and their
high-security requirements, improving the ability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an urgent research problem.
The recent work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of
negative energy scores that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to
detect node-level OOD data. However, our study finds that score aggregation
among nodes is susceptible to extreme values due to the unboundedness of the
negative energy scores and logit shifts, which severely limits the accuracy of
GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In this paper, we propose NODESAFE:
reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes by adding two optimization
terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and mitigate the logit
shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically improves the
ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting OOD
data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better)
in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA
by 28.4% (22.7%).

Motivation: 混沌系统（如天气、疾病传播、金融市场）广泛存在且难以预测，研究其预测方法对社会有重要意义。

Method: 使用Runge Kutta方法生成合成数据，采用单步滑动窗口和时间步长方法训练模型，并通过RMSE和R²评估性能。

Result: LSTM在双摆系统中表现最佳；VRNN和GRU在三摆系统中表现较好，但LSTM在考虑摩擦时仍为最优。

Conclusion: LSTM是预测混沌系统的有效工具，尤其在双摆系统中表现突出。

Abstract: A chaotic system is a highly volatile system characterized by its sensitive
dependence on initial conditions and outside factors. Chaotic systems are
prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks,
and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science
and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to
society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and
neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for
their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by
generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time
using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations
(ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach,
predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However,
to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we
transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network
on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles,
or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also
evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded
that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory
Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both
friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent
Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated
Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for
friction, LSTM was the best.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，Stratify性能接近IID基线，加速收敛并减少客户端计算。

Conclusion: Stratify在现实联邦学习场景中具有实际有效性，解决了非独立同分布数据的核心问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on non-independently and identically distributed
(non-IID) data remains a critical challenge, as existing approaches struggle
with severe data heterogeneity. Current methods primarily address symptoms of
non-IID by applying incremental adjustments to Federated Averaging (FedAvg),
rather than directly resolving its inherent design limitations. Consequently,
performance significantly deteriorates under highly heterogeneous conditions,
as the fundamental issue of imbalanced exposure to diverse class and feature
distributions remains unresolved. This paper introduces Stratify, a novel FL
framework designed to systematically manage class and feature distributions
throughout training, effectively tackling the root cause of non-IID challenges.
Inspired by classical stratified sampling, our approach employs a Stratified
Label Schedule (SLS) to ensure balanced exposure across labels, significantly
reducing bias and variance in aggregated gradients. Complementing SLS, we
propose a label-aware client selection strategy, restricting participation
exclusively to clients possessing data relevant to scheduled labels.
Additionally, Stratify incorporates a fine-grained, high-frequency update
scheme, accelerating convergence and further mitigating data heterogeneity. To
uphold privacy, we implement a secure client selection protocol leveraging
homomorphic encryption, enabling precise global label statistics without
disclosing sensitive client information. Extensive evaluations on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, COVTYPE, PACS, and Digits-DG demonstrate
that Stratify attains performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates
convergence, and reduces client-side computation compared to state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its practical effectiveness in realistic federated
learning scenarios.

Motivation: 多模态学习通常假设所有模态可用，但现实中数据常缺失。现有方法忽视重建的不可靠性，影响输出质量。

Method: SURE引入潜在空间重建和不确定性估计，采用Pearson相关性损失和统计误差传播技术。

Result: 在情感分析、类型分类和动作识别等任务中，SURE表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SURE为不完整数据提供了可靠的多模态学习解决方案，提升了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating
diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities
- an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained
multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale
and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical
applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have
overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise
the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and
Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of
pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and
uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks.
Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and
delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and
performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and
applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time,
allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model
predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis,
genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the
presence of incomplete data.

Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the
color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can
be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space.
Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to
significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community
composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing
applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study
presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral
missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of
phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral
remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to
varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated
concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this
study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time
tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral
retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex
estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation
demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low
bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning
designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over
the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional
data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and
PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission
will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community
dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.

Result: 在F1Tenth赛车和动态障碍物碰撞预测的案例中，该方法在OOD环境下表现出色，实现了高召回率和及时性，同时减少了精度损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在OOD数据下仍能提供理论保证，并优于其他不确定性量化方法，为学习型系统的安全监控提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The safety of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems is compromised by the
well-known vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs. Existing literature has sought to monitor the safety of such systems by
detecting OOD data. However, such approaches have limited utility, as the
presence of an OOD input does not necessarily imply the violation of a desired
safety property. We instead propose to directly monitor safety in a manner that
is itself robust to OOD data. To this end, we predict violations of signal
temporal logic safety specifications based on predicted future trajectories.
Our safety monitor additionally uses a novel combination of adaptive conformal
prediction and incremental learning. The former obtains probabilistic
prediction guarantees even on OOD data, and the latter prevents overly
conservative predictions. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach in
two case studies on safety monitoring: 1) predicting collisions of an F1Tenth
car with static obstacles, and 2) predicting collisions of a race car with
multiple dynamic obstacles. We find that adaptive conformal prediction obtains
theoretical guarantees where other uncertainty quantification methods fail to
do so. Additionally, combining adaptive conformal prediction and incremental
learning for safety monitoring achieves high recall and timeliness while
reducing loss in precision. We achieve these results even in OOD settings and
outperform alternative methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LA2Former的局部感知注意力Transformer，用于解决传统神经算子在复杂几何和不规则网格上的局限性，通过结合全局和局部注意力机制，显著提升了PDE建模的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算子（如FNO）依赖均匀网格，限制了其在复杂几何和不规则网格上的应用。Transformer-based神经算子虽有所改进，但过于强调全局特征聚合，忽略了细尺度动态和局部PDE行为。

Method: 提出LA2Former，利用K近邻动态分块，并集成全局-局部注意力机制，结合线性注意力和成对注意力，优化计算效率和预测准确性。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的评估显示，LA2Former比现有线性注意力方法提升50%以上的预测准确性，并在最优条件下优于全成对注意力方法。

Conclusion: LA2Former强调了局部特征学习在Transformer-based神经算子中的重要性，为复杂和不规则域上的PDE求解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising frameworks for learning mappings
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), serving as data-driven
alternatives to traditional numerical methods. While methods such as the
Fourier neural operator (FNO) have demonstrated notable performance, their
reliance on uniform grids restricts their applicability to complex geometries
and irregular meshes. Recently, Transformer-based neural operators with linear
attention mechanisms have shown potential in overcoming these limitations for
large-scale PDE simulations. However, these approaches predominantly emphasize
global feature aggregation, often overlooking fine-scale dynamics and localized
PDE behaviors essential for accurate solutions. To address these challenges, we
propose the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former), which leverages
K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and integrates global-local
attention for enhanced PDE modeling. By combining linear attention for
efficient global context encoding with pairwise attention for capturing
intricate local interactions, LA2Former achieves an optimal balance between
computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations across
six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy
by over 50% relative to existing linear attention methods, while also
outperforming full pairwise attention under optimal conditions. This work
underscores the critical importance of localized feature learning in advancing
Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular
domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非线性PID结合的潜在张量分解模型（NPIL），用于改进非侵入式负载监测（NILM）中缺失数据的估计，通过结合历史信息和参数优化，显著提升了收敛速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NILM数据常因传感器故障等原因缺失，现有基于随机梯度下降（SGD）的方法收敛慢且未充分利用历史信息。

Method: 提出NPIL模型，结合非线性PID控制器原理和粒子群优化（PSO）算法，改进学习误差和参数适应。

Result: 实验表明，NPIL在收敛速度和缺失数据预测准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NPIL模型有效解决了NILM数据缺失问题，提升了监测精度和效率。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has emerged as a key smart grid
technology, identifying electrical device and providing detailed energy
consumption data for precise demand response management. Nevertheless, NILM
data suffers from missing values due to inescapable factors like sensor
failure, leading to inaccuracies in non-intrusive load monitoring. A stochastic
gradient descent (SGD)-based latent factorization of tensors model has proven
to be effective in estimating missing data, however, it updates a latent factor
solely based on the current stochastic gradient, without considering past
information, which leads to slow convergence of anLFT model. To address this
issue, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Proportional-integral-derivative
(PID)-Incorporated Latent factorization of tensors (NPIL) model with two-fold
ideas: a) rebuilding the instant learning error according to the principle of a
nonlinear PID controller, thus, the past update information is efficiently
incorporated into the learning scheme, and b) implementing gain parameter
adaptation by utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, hence, the
model computational efficiency is effectively improved. Experimental results on
real-world NILM datasets demonstrate that the proposed NPIL model surpasses
state-of-the-art models in convergence rate and accuracy when predicting the
missing NILM data.

Conclusion: 监控与恢复范式是未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: With the known vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift,
maintaining reliability in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems poses a
salient challenge. In response, many existing methods adopt a detect and
abstain methodology, aiming to detect distribution shift at inference time so
that the learning-enabled component can abstain from decision-making. This
approach, however, has limited use in real-world applications. We instead
propose a monitor and recover paradigm as a promising direction for future
research. This philosophy emphasizes 1) robust safety monitoring instead of
distribution shift detection and 2) distribution shift recovery instead of
abstention. We discuss two examples from our recent work.

Abstract: Accurate financial market forecasting requires diverse data sources,
including historical price trends, macroeconomic indicators, and financial
news, each contributing unique predictive signals. However, existing methods
often process these modalities independently or fail to effectively model their
interactions. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF), a
novel transformer-based framework that integrates heterogeneous financial data
to improve predictive accuracy. Our approach employs attention mechanisms to
dynamically weight the contribution of different modalities, along with a
specialized tensor interpretation module for feature extraction. To facilitate
rapid model iteration in industry applications, we incorporate a mature
auto-training scheme that streamlines optimization. When applied to real-world
financial datasets, CMTF demonstrates improvements over baseline models in
forecasting stock price movements and provides a scalable and effective
solution for cross-modal integration in financial market prediction.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了黑盒模型在有限观测下的优化问题，平衡了性能与风险，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Existing portfolio management approaches are often black-box models due to
safety and commercial issues in the industry. However, their performance can
vary considerably whenever market conditions or internal trading strategies
change. Furthermore, evaluating these non-transparent systems is expensive,
where certain budgets limit observations of the systems. Therefore, optimizing
performance while controlling the potential risk of these financial systems has
become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization
framework to optimize black-box portfolio management models under limited
observations. In conventional Bayesian optimization settings, the objective
function is to maximize the expectation of performance metrics. However, simply
maximizing performance expectations leads to erratic optimization trajectories,
which exacerbate risk accumulation in portfolio management. Meanwhile, this can
lead to misalignment between the target distribution and the actual
distribution of the black-box model. To mitigate this problem, we propose an
adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator considering dual objective, which
incorporates maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of model
observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach
over five backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management
models. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the proposed
estimator.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于目标传播的RNN训练方法，使用局部表示对齐（LRA）以减少梯度消失和爆炸问题，并通过梯度正则化改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPTT算法在训练RNN时存在梯度不稳定和生物不现实的问题，限制了RNN的实际应用。

Method: 采用局部表示对齐（LRA）方法，分析其性能并引入梯度正则化以促进梯度流动。

Result: 实验表明，未正则化的LRA RNN仍存在梯度消失问题，而正则化版本在多个任务中表现显著优于未正则化版本。

Conclusion: 梯度正则化有效解决了LRA RNN的梯度问题，提升了模型性能，扩展了RNN的实用范围。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing,
streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited.
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training
RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and
vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we
present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses
local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN
models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural
language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control
systems, and robotics.
  The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We
thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with
normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain
assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate
that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still
suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as
proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in
an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We
address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the
update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and
meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the
algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms
the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit
temporal order, and random permutation.

Abstract: We develop sampling formulas for high-dimensional functions in reproducing

determining sequences of data points. We place particular emphasis on sampling
formulas for tensor product kernels, where we show that determining irregular
samples in lower dimensions can be composed to obtain a tensor of determining
irregular samples in higher dimensions. This in turn reduces the computational
complexity of sampling formulas for high-dimensional functions quite
significantly.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer模型对Hölder连续函数类的逼近能力，构造了能够克服维度灾难的Transformer结构，展示了其强大的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在逼近高维函数时的能力，尤其是针对Hölder连续函数类，以克服维度灾难问题。

Method: 构造了包含单头自注意力层和若干前馈层的Transformer，激活函数为softmax、ReLU和floor等，基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理进行设计。

Result: 在逼近精度为ε时，仅需O(log(1/ε))层前馈层，宽度不超过O(1/ε^(2/β)log(1/ε))；若允许其他激活函数，宽度可进一步降至常数。

Conclusion: Transformer具有强大的表达能力，本文的构造方法直观清晰，且提出的平移技术有助于将前馈网络的逼近结果应用于Transformer研究。

Abstract: The Transformer model is widely used in various application areas of machine
learning, such as natural language processing. This paper investigates the
approximation of the H\"older continuous function class
$\mathcal{H}_{Q}^{\beta}\left([0,1]^{d\times n},\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}\right)$
by Transformers and constructs several Transformers that can overcome the curse
of dimensionality. These Transformers consist of one self-attention layer with
one head and the softmax function as the activation function, along with
several feedforward layers. For example, to achieve an approximation accuracy
of $\epsilon$, if the activation functions of the feedforward layers in the
Transformer are ReLU and floor, only
$\mathcal{O}\left(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ layers of feedforward layers
are needed, with widths of these layers not exceeding
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2/\beta}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$.
If other activation functions are allowed in the feedforward layers, the width
of the feedforward layers can be further reduced to a constant. These results
demonstrate that Transformers have a strong expressive capability. The
construction in this paper is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation
Theorem and does not require the concept of contextual mapping, hence our proof
is more intuitively clear compared to previous Transformer approximation works.
Additionally, the translation technique proposed in this paper helps to apply
the previous approximation results of feedforward neural networks to
Transformer research.

Conclusion: MESU结合元可塑性、贝叶斯推断和Hessian正则化，为稳健的持续学习提供了生物启发的解决方案。

Abstract: Biological synapses effortlessly balance memory retention and flexibility,
yet artificial neural networks still struggle with the extremes of catastrophic
forgetting and catastrophic remembering. Here, we introduce Metaplasticity from
Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU), a Bayesian framework that updates network
parameters according their uncertainty. This approach allows a principled
combination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is
preserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike
standard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and
popular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU
seamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic
uncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only
computational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper
output statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate
that MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for
new tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms
established continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to
learn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally,
due to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional
learning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently
in a wide range of scenarios. Our results unify ideas from metaplasticity,
Bayesian inference, and Hessian-based regularization, offering a
biologically-inspired pathway to robust, perpetual learning.

Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under
resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational
efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms,
despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high
computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability
in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or
real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation
Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the
MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with
independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features,
adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a
convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational
graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10
dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%)
models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm
the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and
compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for
maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware
acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its
practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in
resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment
systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as
text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can
impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and
influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited
in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or
hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by
employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns,
and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data.
Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time
the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting
cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our
findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available,
transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as
a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in
cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between
cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that
the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its
price movement.

Abstract: Machine unlearning poses the challenge of ``how to eliminate the influence of
specific data from a pretrained model'' in regard to privacy concerns. While
prior research on approximated unlearning has demonstrated accuracy and
efficiency in time complexity, we claim that it falls short of achieving exact
unlearning, and we are the first to focus on fairness and robustness in machine
unlearning algorithms. Our study presents fairness Conjectures for a
well-trained model, based on the variance-bias trade-off characteristic, and
considers their relevance to robustness. Our Conjectures are supported by
experiments conducted on the two most widely used model architectures, ResNet
and ViT, demonstrating the correlation between fairness and robustness:
\textit{the higher fairness-gap is, the more the model is sensitive and
vulnerable}. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of
current state-of-the-art approximated unlearning algorithms to adversarial
attacks, where their unlearned models suffer a significant drop in accuracy
compared to the exact-unlearned models. We claim that our fairness-gap
measurement and robustness metric should be used to evaluate the unlearning
algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unlearning in the intermediate and

*Dejan Stancevic,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于熵的时间调度器，用于生成扩散模型，通过非均匀时间采样提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型的性能依赖于噪声调度函数的选择，传统均匀时间采样可能效率不足。

Method: 提出基于熵的时间重参数化方法，确保每个采样点贡献相等信息量，并提供精确计算公式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了预训练模型的图像质量（FID和FD-DINO评分），尤其在低NFEs情况下。

Conclusion: 基于熵的时间重参数化是一种高效且无需额外计算开销的改进方法。

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the
appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be
equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present
a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than
uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of
information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization
does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a
tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained
model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the
entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled
entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and
ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the
inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image
quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can
be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization
without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater
improvements in the few NFEs regime.

*Samuel Wertz,Arnaud Vandaele,Nicolas Gillis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的Hadamard分解算法，通过交替优化和动量更新技术，解决了非凸问题，并扩展了多矩阵分解框架。实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hadamard分解在数据分析和矩阵压缩中具有重要作用，但现有方法效率不足，需改进算法以提升性能。

Method: 采用交替优化将全局非凸问题分解为凸子问题，结合SVD初始化策略和动量更新技术，并扩展至多矩阵分解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样数据集上优于梯度下降和传统低秩近似技术。

Conclusion: 提出的算法高效且灵活，适用于更复杂的Hadamard分解任务。

Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and
matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise
product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an
efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating
optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a
series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced
initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD)
and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates.
Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard
decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling
approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational
efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method
with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard
decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The
results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图少样本类增量学习（GFSCIL）方法MEGA，通过元训练阶段的二阶梯度计算，有效缓解灾难性遗忘，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型网络（PNs）的GFSCIL方法在增量学习阶段过度简化，且未能整合图持续学习（GCL）技术，因此需要更严格的设置和改进方法。

Method: 提出MEGA方法，通过元训练阶段的二阶梯度计算，学习高质量的先验知识，并在增量学习阶段对齐行为。

Result: 在四个主流图数据集上的实验表明，MEGA取得了最优性能，并提升了多种GCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MEGA作为一种模型无关的GFSCIL范式，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to
continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on
a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical
Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model
during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods
oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate
Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To
address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for
GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning
(MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL.
Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the
meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that
enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the
meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four
mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art
results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We
believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm,
paving the way for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态正则化的因果提升决策树（CBDT）框架，通过动态更新正则化参数来优化高维数据中的异质性治疗效果估计，显著提高了估计精度和模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，现有树状因果推断方法难以捕捉复杂交互且依赖静态正则化，导致估计误差较高。

Method: 提出CBDT框架，将方差正则化和平均治疗效果校准集成到梯度提升决策树的损失函数中，并动态更新正则化参数。

Result: 在标准基准数据集和真实临床数据上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了估计精度，并在ICU患者分诊研究中识别出可操作的临床规则。

Conclusion: 动态正则化能有效缩小误差界限，提升预测性能和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands
models that simultaneously optimize precision, interpretability, and
calibration. Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however,
exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they
struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static
regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal
Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance
regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function
of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the
regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the
bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets
and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true
treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method
successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy
in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic
regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive
performance and model interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力权重的令牌归因方法AT2，通过将不同注意力头的权重作为特征学习，高效且可靠地替代了传统的高成本消融方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成序列时，识别影响生成的前驱令牌成本高昂，传统消融方法效率低。注意力权重虽被用作启发式方法，但直接使用效果不佳。

Method: 将不同注意力头的权重作为特征，通过学习（利用消融信号）有效利用注意力权重进行归因，提出AT2方法。

Result: AT2在性能上与高成本消融方法相当，但效率显著提升，并能用于上下文修剪以提升问答质量。

Conclusion: AT2提供了一种高效可靠的令牌归因方法，适用于实际应用，如上下文优化。

Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens generated by a language model, we may want to
identify the preceding tokens that influence the model to generate this
sequence. Performing such token attribution is expensive; a common approach is
to ablate preceding tokens and directly measure their effects. To reduce the
cost of token attribution, we revisit attention weights as a heuristic for how
a language model uses previous tokens. Naive approaches to attribute model
behavior with attention (e.g., averaging attention weights across attention
heads to estimate a token's influence) have been found to be unreliable. To
attain faithful attributions, we propose treating the attention weights of
different attention heads as features. This way, we can learn how to
effectively leverage attention weights for attribution (using signal from
ablations). Our resulting method, Attribution with Attention (AT2), reliably
performs on par with approaches that involve many ablations, while being
significantly more efficient. To showcase the utility of AT2, we use it to
prune less important parts of a provided context in a question answering
setting, improving answer quality. We provide code for AT2 at
https://github.com/MadryLab/AT2 .

*Amin Noroozi,Sidratul Muntaha Esha,Mansoureh Ghari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过机器学习方法分析了英格兰150个地区2021-2024年儿童疫苗接种率的差异，发现地理、文化和人口因素是主要影响因素，而社会经济因素影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决传统方法在捕捉疫苗接种率动态和多变量特性上的不足，揭示影响疫苗接种率的复杂因素。

Method: 采用纵向机器学习分析，包括层次聚类、CatBoost分类器和SHAP解释方法。

Result: 分类器预测准确率高（92.1%、90.6%、86.3%），地理、文化和人口变量（如农村地区、英语熟练度）影响最大。

Conclusion: 农村地区疫苗接种率更高，语言和民族因素与低接种率相关，社会经济因素影响较小。

Abstract: Childhood vaccination is a cornerstone of public health, yet disparities in
vaccination coverage persist across England. These disparities are shaped by
complex interactions among various factors, including geographic, demographic,
socioeconomic, and cultural (GDSC) factors. Previous studies mostly rely on
cross-sectional data and traditional statistical approaches that assess
individual or limited sets of variables in isolation. Such methods may fall
short in capturing the dynamic and multivariate nature of vaccine uptake. In
this paper, we conducted a longitudinal machine learning analysis of childhood
vaccination coverage across 150 districts in England from 2021 to 2024. Using
vaccination data from NHS records, we applied hierarchical clustering to group
districts by vaccination coverage into low- and high-coverage clusters. A
CatBoost classifier was then trained to predict districts' vaccination clusters
using their GDSC data. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method
was used to interpret the predictors' importance. The classifier achieved high
accuracies of 92.1, 90.6, and 86.3 in predicting districts' vaccination
clusters for the years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024, respectively. SHAP
revealed that geographic, cultural, and demographic variables, particularly
rurality, English language proficiency, the percentage of foreign-born
residents, and ethnic composition, were the most influential predictors of
vaccination coverage, whereas socioeconomic variables, such as deprivation and
employment, consistently showed lower importance, especially in 2023-2024.
Surprisingly, rural districts were significantly more likely to have higher
vaccination rates. Additionally, districts with lower vaccination coverage had
higher populations whose first language was not English, who were born outside
the UK, or who were from ethnic minority groups.

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）用于解释大语言模型激活，并通过研究上下文学习（ICL）机制验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SAEs在解释大语言模型中的实用性，尤其是对ICL机制的理解。

Method: 使用SAEs识别任务执行特征，并通过稀疏特征电路方法分析Gemma-1 2B模型中的ICL机制。

Result: 发现任务检测特征及其因果关联，任务向量可通过稀疏SAE潜在向量近似表示。

Conclusion: SAEs能有效揭示ICL机制，任务向量与稀疏潜在特征密切相关。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular tool for interpreting large language
model activations, but their utility in addressing open questions in
interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate their
effectiveness by using SAEs to deepen our understanding of the mechanism behind
in-context learning (ICL). We identify abstract SAE features that (i) encode
the model's knowledge of which task to execute and (ii) whose latent vectors
causally induce the task zero-shot. This aligns with prior work showing that
ICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors
are well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these
task-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we adapt the sparse
feature circuits methodology of Marks et al. (2024) to work for the much larger
Gemma-1 2B model, with 30 times as many parameters, and to the more complex
task of ICL. Through circuit finding, we discover task-detecting features with
corresponding SAE latents that activate earlier in the prompt, that detect when
tasks have been performed. They are causally linked with task-execution
features through the attention and MLP sublayers.

Motivation: 强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时面临计算与内存需求的不对称问题，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: 提出PODS框架，采用max-variance down-sampling方法选择多样化的rollout子集进行策略更新。

Result: PODS在GSM8K基准上表现优于标准GRPO。

Conclusion: PODS通过解耦并行生成与策略更新，有效解决了RL中的不对称问题，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental
asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly
parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require
extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry,
we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that
strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in
parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we
develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that
selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this
approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate
that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior
performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

Motivation: 多体动力学系统的实时建模对数字孪生应用至关重要，但现有方法难以同时预测内部载荷和系统轨迹，而这对故障检测和预测性维护尤为重要。

Method: 采用物理信息图神经网络，结合等变消息传递和基于欧拉积分的时间感知节点更新机制，适用于圆柱滚子轴承等系统。

Result: 在未见的工况下仍能准确预测载荷和轨迹，性能优于现有方法，计算速度比传统求解器快200倍。

Conclusion: Equi-Euler GraphNet是一种高效的降阶模型，适用于数字孪生、设计和维护。

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for
enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven
approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and
system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially
important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal
loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear
or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to
degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and
remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a
physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts
internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this
mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode
interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an
equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction
forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware
iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture
influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller
bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling
elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler
GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting
loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It
outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering
stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation.
Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining
comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital
twins, design, and maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs因记忆训练数据中隐私或版权信息而引发的伦理和法律问题，避免昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 使用ε-差分隐私（DP）保护训练数据，开发DP2Unlearning框架，实现高效遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，DP2Unlearning在保留模型性能的同时，遗忘成本仅为重新训练的一半，优于近似遗忘方法。

Conclusion: DP2Unlearning是一种高效且具有正式遗忘保证的LLM遗忘方法，优于重新训练和近似遗忘。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing
tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to
memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training
data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this
happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding
the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been
forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning
offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of
the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks
forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this
work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers
formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from
scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on
textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later
enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated
with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning
achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM
retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning
-- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a
reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at
both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively
forgetting the targeted information.

Conclusion: ReLU激活的GNNs在高同质性图或低维/独热编码特征下易受攻击，研究结果为关键应用提供了缓解风险的实用建议。

Abstract: We investigate the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to bit-flip
attacks (BFAs) by introducing an analytical framework to study the influence of
architectural features, graph properties, and their interaction.
  The expressivity of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish
non-isomorphic graphs and depends on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We
examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this
purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to
losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of
homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions
on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit flips
required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated
GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot
encoded features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten
real-world datasets confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical
insights and offer actionable results to mitigate BFA risks in
expressivity-critical applications.

Result: SCA提供了非平凡且可解释的稳定性保证，且通过温和平滑实现了准确性与稳定性的平衡。

Conclusion: 软稳定性是衡量解释方法鲁棒性的有效工具，SCA算法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Stability guarantees are an emerging tool for evaluating feature
attributions, but existing certification methods rely on smoothed classifiers
and often yield conservative guarantees. To address these limitations, we
introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, and
sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that provides
non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution. Moreover, we show
that mild smoothing enables a graceful tradeoff between accuracy and stability,
in contrast to prior certification methods that require a more aggressive
compromise. Using Boolean function analysis, we give a novel characterization
of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of
explanation methods.

Conclusion: 量化误差并非分类性能的决定因素，低比特量化方法可通过提升特征判别性实现更好的分类效果。

Abstract: In machine learning, quantization is widely used to simplify data
representation and facilitate algorithm deployment on hardware. Given the
fundamental role of classification in machine learning, it is crucial to
investigate the impact of quantization on classification. Current research
primarily focuses on quantization errors, operating under the premise that
higher quantization errors generally result in lower classification
performance. However, this premise lacks a solid theoretical foundation and
often contradicts empirical findings. For instance, certain extremely low
bit-width quantization methods, such as $\{0,1\}$-binary quantization and $\{0,
\pm1\}$-ternary quantization, can achieve comparable or even superior
classification accuracy compared to the original non-quantized data, despite
exhibiting high quantization errors. To more accurately evaluate classification
performance, we propose to directly investigate the feature discrimination of
quantized data, instead of analyzing its quantization error. Interestingly, it
is found that both binary and ternary quantization methods can improve, rather
than degrade, the feature discrimination of the original data. This remarkable
performance is validated through classification experiments across various data
types, including images, speech, and texts.

Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rotating machinery is critical
for industrial safety and maintenance, but existing methods struggle with
scarce target-domain data and unclear degradation dynamics. We propose a

Conclusion: 结合Time2Vec和Transformer的架构及相关性特征选择方法，为金融时间序列预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series
analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations
and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success
mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also
influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and
long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to
recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in
stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on
individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability
to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance
and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit
correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating
Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of
different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method.
Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a
comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that
our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as
positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features
enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Motivation: 解决大型预训练网络对i.i.d.假设的依赖问题，推动AI在动态环境中的适应性，实现持续学习。

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field,
unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However,
these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning
approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders
their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next
breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving
environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive
sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a
Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural
models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of
adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and
efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning.
However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to
multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic
Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and
PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient
Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss
evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal
is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,
guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research
directions.

TL;DR: SwitchMT是一种自适应任务切换方法，用于强化学习中的多任务学习，通过深度脉冲Q网络和自适应策略解决任务干扰问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多任务学习中表现不佳，且固定任务切换间隔限制了可扩展性。SwitchMT旨在通过自适应任务切换和脉冲神经网络提升多任务学习效果。

Method: SwitchMT结合深度脉冲Q网络（具有主动树突和对偶结构）和自适应任务切换策略，利用任务特定上下文信号和网络参数动态调整。

Result: SwitchMT在多个Atari游戏中表现优异（如Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6, Enduro: 355.2），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwitchMT有效解决了任务干扰问题，提升了多任务学习的自动化能力，为高效通用智能体提供了新方向。

Abstract: The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on
multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments.
However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in
single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks
due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the
agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a
state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve
multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while
enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed
context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the
scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these
limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology
for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT
employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active
dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to
create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that
leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in
multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves
competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6,
and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better
generalized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling
multi-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving
the way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning
capabilities.

Motivation: 探讨竞争环境下企业如何选择投资以提高模型准确性，以及这种选择对消费者和整体福利的影响。

Method: 建立消费者-企业双寡头模型，分析企业如何通过投资减少模型错误（如假阳性和假阴性率）。

Result: 竞争市场中，企业投资于优势维度能提高利润，但整体准确性不一定改善；这种策略对消费者不利但增加总体福利。

Conclusion: 企业在竞争中的最优策略是专注于优势维度，而非全面改进模型准确性，这对市场动态和福利有重要影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the market for AI models in which firms compete to
provide accurate model predictions and consumers exhibit heterogeneous
preferences for model accuracy. We develop a consumer-firm duopoly model to
analyze how competition affects firms' incentives to improve model accuracy.
Each firm aims to minimize its model's error, but this choice can often be
suboptimal. Counterintuitively, we find that in a competitive market, firms
that improve overall accuracy do not necessarily improve their profits. Rather,
each firm's optimal decision is to invest further on the error dimension where
it has a competitive advantage. By decomposing model errors into false positive
and false negative rates, firms can reduce errors in each dimension through
investments. Firms are strictly better off investing on their superior
dimension and strictly worse off with investments on their inferior dimension.
Profitable investments adversely affect consumers but increase overall welfare.

Abstract: Artificial intelligent (AI) conversational agents hold a promising future in
the field of mental health, especially in helping marginalized communities that
lack access to mental health support services. It is tempting to have a 24/7
mental health companion that can be accessed anywhere using mobile phones to
provide therapist-like advice. Yet, caution should be taken, and studies around
their feasibility need to be surveyed. Before adopting such a rapidly changing
technology, studies on its feasibility should be explored, summarized, and
synthesized to gain a solid understanding of the status quo and to enable us to
build a framework that can guide us throughout the development and deployment
processes. Different perspectives must be considered when investigating the
feasibility of AI conversational agents, including the mental healthcare
professional perspective. The literature can provide insights into their
perspectives in terms of opportunities, concerns, and implications. Mental
health professionals, the subject-matter experts in this field, have their
points of view that should be understood and considered. This systematic
literature review will explore mental health practitioners' attitudes toward AI
conversational agents and the factors that affect their adoption and
recommendation of the technology to augment their services and treatments. The
TAM3 Framework will be the lens through which this systematic literature review

Motivation: 在线空间为自杀意念（SI）表达和寻求支持提供了平台，但缺乏理论框架理解高风险自杀意图的潜在因素。

Method: 使用IPTS理论分析59,607条帖子，分类为SI维度和风险因素，并通过语言分析研究支持性回应。

Result: 高风险SI帖子表现出计划、尝试、方法和痛苦；AI聊天机器人在支持性回应中虽有结构连贯性，但缺乏动态和个性化。

Conclusion: AI驱动的心理健康干预需更深入理解和反思，以实现有效支持。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global public health issue, with millions experiencing
suicidal ideation (SI) each year. Online spaces enable individuals to express
SI and seek peer support. While prior research has revealed the potential of
detecting SI using machine learning and natural language analysis, a key
limitation is the lack of a theoretical framework to understand the underlying
factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent. To bridge this gap, we adopted the
Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) as an analytic lens to analyze 59,607
posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, categorizing them into SI dimensions
(Loneliness, Lack of Reciprocal Love, Self Hate, and Liability) and risk
factors (Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Acquired
Capability of Suicide). We found that high-risk SI posts express planning and
attempts, methods and tools, and weaknesses and pain. In addition, we also
examined the language of supportive responses through psycholinguistic and
content analyses to find that individuals respond differently to different
stages of Suicidal Ideation (SI) posts. Finally, we explored the role of AI
chatbots in providing effective supportive responses to suicidal ideation
posts. We found that although AI improved structural coherence, expert
evaluations highlight persistent shortcomings in providing dynamic,
personalized, and deeply empathetic support. These findings underscore the need
for careful reflection and deeper understanding in both the development and
consideration of AI-driven interventions for effective mental health support.

Abstract: The idea of augmented or hybrid intelligence offers a compelling vision for
combining human and AI capabilities, especially in tasks where human wisdom,
expertise, or common sense are essential. Unfortunately, human reasoning can be
flawed and shortsighted, resulting in adverse individual impacts or even
long-term societal consequences. While strong efforts are being made to develop

fostering wiser and more intelligent human participation. Tools that enhance
critical thinking, ingenuity, expertise, and even wisdom could be essential in
addressing the challenges of our emerging future. This paper proposes the
development of generative AI-based tools that enhance both the human ability to
reflect upon a problem as well as the ability to explore the technical aspects
of it. A high-level model is also described for integrating AI and human
capabilities in a way that centralizes human participation and control.

Result: RAGGY有效缩短调试周期，提升开发效率，并总结了未来RAG工具的设计启示。

Conclusion: RAGGY为RAG管道开发提供了实用的调试工具，未来可进一步优化开发者工作流程。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto
approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific
knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R)
relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language
Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses.
Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation
components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is
challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making
it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The
parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of
pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles.
To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a
Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for
real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY,
insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12
engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with
developers' natural workflows.

Conclusion: 多模态提示是提升LLM在可视化创作中可用性的关键，未来系统设计应注重多模态输入。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in
automating the process of visualization authoring through simple natural
language utterances. However, instructing LLMs using natural language is
limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent,
leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these
limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret
ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring,
and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the
findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text
prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation
abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization
authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create
visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct
manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a
controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive
way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency
compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact
of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings
highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of
LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future
visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can
enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks. All materials

Conclusion: AI/AE平台有效提升材料研究效率，为电子材料设计提供新思路。

Abstract: AI-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) can accelerate materials
discovery but its effectiveness for electronic materials is hindered by data
scarcity from lengthy and complex design-fabricate-test-analyze cycles. Unlike
experienced human scientists, even advanced AI algorithms in AI/AE lack the
adaptability to make informative real-time decisions with limited datasets.
Here, we address this challenge by developing and implementing an AI decision
interface on our AI/AE system. The central element of the interface is an AI
advisor that performs real-time progress monitoring, data analysis, and
interactive human-AI collaboration for actively adapting to experiments in
different stages and types. We applied this platform to an emerging type of
electronic materials-mixed ion-electron conducting polymers (MIECPs) -- to
engineer and study the relationships between multiscale morphology and
properties. Using organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) as the testing-bed
device for evaluating the mixed-conducting figure-of-merit -- the product of
charge-carrier mobility and the volumetric capacitance ({\mu}C*), our adaptive
AI/AE platform achieved a 150% increase in {\mu}C* compared to the commonly
used spin-coating method, reaching 1,275 F cm-1 V-1 s-1 in just 64 autonomous
experimental trials. A study of 10 statistically selected samples identifies
two key structural factors for achieving higher volumetric capacitance: larger
crystalline lamellar spacing and higher specific surface area, while also
uncovering a new polymer polymorph in this material.

Abstract: For large-scale multi-gateway LoRaWAN networks, this study proposes a

collaborative decision-making between gateways and terminal nodes. HEAT-LDL
combines the Actor-Critic architecture and the Lyapunov optimization method to
achieve intelligent downlink control and gateway load balancing. When the
signal quality is good, the network server uses the HEAT algorithm to schedule
the terminal nodes. To improve the efficiency of autonomous decision-making of
terminal nodes, HEAT-LDL performs cloud-edge knowledge distillation on the HEAT
teacher model on the terminal node side. When the downlink decision instruction
is lost, the terminal node uses the student model and the edge decider based on
prior knowledge and local history to make collaborative autonomous decisions.
Simulation experiments show that compared with the optimal results of all

Conclusion: SFL-LEO框架有效解决了LEO卫星网络的动态性和计算限制问题。

Abstract: Recently, the rapid development of LEO satellite networks spurs another
widespread concern-data processing at satellites. However, achieving efficient
computation at LEO satellites in highly dynamic satellite networks is
challenging and remains an open problem when considering the constrained
computation capability of LEO satellites. For the first time, we propose a
novel distributed learning framework named SFL-LEO by combining Federated
Learning (FL) with Split Learning (SL) to accommodate the high dynamics of LEO
satellite networks and the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites
by leveraging the periodical orbit traveling feature. The proposed scheme
allows training locally by introducing an asynchronous training strategy, i.e.,
achieving local update when LEO satellites disconnect with the ground station,
to provide much more training space and thus increase the training performance.
Meanwhile, it aggregates client-side sub-models at the ground station and then
distributes them to LEO satellites by borrowing the idea from the federated
learning scheme. Experiment results driven by satellite-ground bandwidth
measured in Starlink demonstrate that SFL-LEO provides a similar accuracy
performance with the conventional SL scheme because it can perform local
training even within the disconnection duration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based
Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human

paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro,
ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their
capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks
(RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel
performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F),
explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the
generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these
features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（人工、基于指标、基于LLM）存在效率低或依赖参考答案的问题，且基于LLM的方法因知识不足和代码理解有限而受限。

Method: CodeVisionary分为两阶段：多源知识分析阶段和协商评分阶段，通过多评委讨论达成共识。

Conclusion: CodeVisionary不仅性能优越，还提供详细评估报告，帮助开发者改进代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code
generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive
evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories,
including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that
human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly
rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing
attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and
superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains
limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient
comprehension of complex code.
  To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based
agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists
of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather
multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a
stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves
multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code
and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments

### [120] [Large Language Models for Validating Network Protocol Parsers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13515)
*Mingwei Zheng,Danning Xie,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PARVAL是一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体框架，用于自动化验证网络协议解析器的实现是否符合协议标准，成功识别了BFD协议中的不一致性和漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议解析器的错误可能导致严重漏洞，现有方法难以自动化验证自然语言协议标准与代码实现的一致性。

Method: PARVAL利用LLM理解自然语言和代码，将协议标准和实现转化为统一的中间表示（格式规范），并进行差异比较。

Result: 在BFD协议上，PARVAL实现了5.6%的低误报率，发现了7个独特漏洞，其中5个是未知问题。

Conclusion: PARVAL为自动化验证协议解析器提供了一种高效方法，显著提升了漏洞检测能力。

Abstract: Network protocol parsers are essential for enabling correct and secure
communication between devices. Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical
vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and
denial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to
compare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this
comparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in
natural language, whereas implementations are in source code. Existing methods
like model checking, fuzzing, and differential testing have been used to find
parsing bugs, but they either require significant manual effort or ignore the
protocol standards, limiting their ability to detect semantic violations. To
enable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol
standards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language
models (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both
natural language and code. It transforms both protocol standards and their
implementations into a unified intermediate representation, referred to as
format specifications, and performs a differential comparison to uncover
inconsistencies. We evaluate PARVAL on the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
(BFD) protocol. Our experiments demonstrate that PARVAL successfully identifies
inconsistencies between the implementation and its RFC standard, achieving a
low false positive rate of 5.6%. PARVAL uncovers seven unique bugs, including
five previously unknown issues.

### [121] [Do Prompt Patterns Affect Code Quality? A First Empirical Assessment of ChatGPT-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13656)
*Antonio Della Porta,Stefano Lambiase,Fabio Palomba*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了提示模式对代码质量的影响，发现提示结构对ChatGPT生成的代码质量（可维护性、安全性和可靠性）影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中存在性能不一致和幻觉问题，提示工程可能改善这些问题，但提示模式对代码质量的影响尚未深入研究。

Method: 使用Dev-GPT数据集，实证研究提示模式对代码质量的影响，分析7583个代码文件的质量指标。

Result: 结果显示Zero-Shot提示最常见，但Kruskal-Wallis测试表明提示模式对代码质量无显著影响。

Conclusion: 提示结构可能对ChatGPT生成的代码质量影响有限，需进一步研究其他因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed software development,
especially in code generation. However, their inconsistent performance, prone
to hallucinations and quality issues, complicates program comprehension and
hinders maintainability. Research indicates that prompt engineering-the
practice of designing inputs to direct LLMs toward generating relevant
outputs-may help address these challenges. In this regard, researchers have
introduced prompt patterns, structured templates intended to guide users in
formulating their requests. However, the influence of prompt patterns on code
quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An improved understanding of
this relationship would be essential to advancing our collective knowledge on
how to effectively use LLMs for code generation, thereby enhancing their
understandability in contemporary software development. This paper empirically
investigates the impact of prompt patterns on code quality, specifically
maintainability, security, and reliability, using the Dev-GPT dataset. Results
show that Zero-Shot prompting is most common, followed by Zero-Shot with
Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot. Analysis of 7583 code files across quality
metrics revealed minimal issues, with Kruskal-Wallis tests indicating no
significant differences among patterns, suggesting that prompt structure may
not substantially impact these quality metrics in ChatGPT-assisted code
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于组件的软件开发（CBSD）研究已有40多年，但工业界仍缺乏广泛接受的组件选择方法或工具，行业与学术界的脱节是主要原因。

Method: 采用混合方法调查了近100名从事组件软件工程实践或研究的人员，了解行业问题、需求及当前最佳实践。

Result: 调查结果包括行业对组件选择质量标准的优先排序，以及对AI驱动工具的现状和未来潜力的看法。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁组件选择工具应结合最新技术进展，尤其是AI，以满足行业需求。

Abstract: Although it has been more than four decades that the first components-based
software development (CBSD) studies were conducted, there is still no standard
method or tool for component selection which is widely accepted by the
industry. The gulf between industry and academia contributes to the lack of an
accepted tool. We conducted a mixed methods survey of nearly 100 people engaged
in component-based software engineering practice or research to better
understand the problems facing industry, how these needs could be addressed,
and current best practices employed in component selection. We also sought to
identify and prioritize quality criteria for component selection from an
industry perspective. In response to the call for CBSD component selection
tools to incorporate recent technical advances, we also explored the
perceptions of professionals about AI-driven tools, present and envisioned.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨工作负载设计空间探索中存在过拟合、数据模糊和工作负载差异等问题。

Method: 采用模型无关元学习，并引入工作负载自适应架构掩码算法。

Result: 在SPEC CPU 2017上的实验显示，预测误差降低了44.3%。

Conclusion: MetaDSE是一种高效的跨工作负载CPU设计空间探索方法，已开源。

Abstract: Cross-workload design space exploration (DSE) is crucial in CPU architecture
design. Existing DSE methods typically employ the transfer learning technique
to leverage knowledge from source workloads, aiming to minimize the requirement
of target workload simulation. However, these methods struggle with
overfitting, data ambiguity, and workload dissimilarity.
  To address these challenges, we reframe the cross-workload CPU DSE task as a
few-shot meta-learning problem and further introduce MetaDSE. By leveraging
model agnostic meta-learning, MetaDSE swiftly adapts to new target workloads,
greatly enhancing the efficiency of cross-workload CPU DSE. Additionally,
MetaDSE introduces a novel knowledge transfer method called the
workload-adaptive architectural mask algorithm, which uncovers the inherent
properties of the architecture. Experiments on SPEC CPU 2017 demonstrate that
MetaDSE significantly reduces prediction error by 44.3\% compared to the
state-of-the-art. MetaDSE is open-sourced and available at this

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对复杂系统中梯度信息不可用的情况，开发一种无梯度的贝叶斯最优实验设计方法。

Method: 结合Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI)进行设计优化，使用Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI)进行高效后验采样，并提出变分高斯和参数化拉普拉斯近似。

Result: 在从线性高斯模型到PDE约束推理任务的数值实验中，展示了方法的鲁棒性、准确性和高效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在信息驱动的实验设计中表现出色，适用于高维空间和复杂系统。

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental
Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient
information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI)
for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI)
sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and
ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested
expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace
approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected
Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation
in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate
the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from
linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's
robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的新框架，用于估计非线性随机系统高阶矩对外部扰动的响应，结合GFDT和基于分数的生成建模，显著优于传统高斯近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GFDT依赖高斯近似，虽能准确预测均值响应，但在高阶矩（如方差、偏度和峰度）上存在显著偏差，需改进。

Method: 将GFDT与基于分数的生成建模结合，直接从数据估计分数函数，无需完整密度重建。

Result: 在三个气候动力学相关的随机模型中验证，新方法成功捕捉了系统的强非线性和非高斯特征。

Conclusion: 新框架在高阶矩响应估计上优于传统高斯近似，适用于复杂非线性系统。

Abstract: We present a novel data-driven framework for estimating the response of
higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external
perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT)
links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear
response. Standard implementations rely on Gaussian approximations, which can
often accurately predict the mean response but usually introduce significant
biases in higher-order moments, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis. To
address this limitation, we combine GFDT with recent advances in score-based
generative modeling, which enable direct estimation of the score function from
data without requiring full density reconstruction. Our method is validated on
three reduced-order stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: a scalar
stochastic model for low-frequency climate variability, a slow-fast triad model
mimicking key features of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and a
six-dimensional stochastic barotropic model capturing atmospheric regime
transitions. In all cases, the approach captures strongly nonlinear and
non-Gaussian features of the system's response, outperforming traditional
Gaussian approximations.

Motivation: Flow Matching作为一种替代扩散模型的简单灵活方法，其理论分析尚不完善，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将Flow Matching与核密度估计关联，分析其在Wasserstein距离下的收敛速率，并验证高维数据中的性能。

Result: Flow Matching在足够大的网络下达到最优收敛速率，且在高维数据中表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文为Flow Matching的实证成功提供了理论基础，并首次证明了其在高维数据中的有效性。

Abstract: Flow Matching has recently gained attention in generative modeling as a
simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, the current state of the
art. While existing statistical guarantees adapt tools from the analysis of
diffusion models, we take a different perspective by connecting Flow Matching
to kernel density estimation. We first verify that the kernel density estimator
matches the optimal rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance up to
logarithmic factors, improving existing bounds for the Gaussian kernel. Based
on this result, we prove that for sufficiently large networks, Flow Matching
also achieves the optimal rate up to logarithmic factors, providing a
theoretical foundation for the empirical success of this method. Finally, we
provide a first justification of Flow Matching's effectiveness in
high-dimensional settings by showing that rates improve when the target
distribution lies on a lower-dimensional linear subspace.

reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). To this end, we discuss approximation
properties of kernel regression under minimalistic assumptions on both the
kernel and the input data. We first prove error estimates in the kernel's RKHS

Abstract: We present new algorithms for estimating and testing \emph{collision
probability}, a fundamental measure of the spread of a discrete distribution
that is widely used in many scientific fields. We describe an algorithm that
satisfies $(\alpha, \beta)$-local differential privacy and estimates collision
probability with error at most $\epsilon$ using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{\log(1/\beta)}{\alpha^2 \epsilon^2}\right)$ samples for
$\alpha \le 1$, which improves over previous work by a factor of
$\frac{1}{\alpha^2}$. We also present a sequential testing algorithm for
collision probability, which can distinguish between collision probability
values that are separated by $\epsilon$ using $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$
samples, even when $\epsilon$ is unknown. Our algorithms have nearly the
optimal sample complexity, and in experiments we show that they require
significantly fewer samples than previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩算法仅关注压缩率与重构失真之间的权衡，而新框架（如RDP和RDC）引入了感知质量或分类准确性作为额外评估维度。本文旨在开发通用编码器，以支持多目标解码。

Method: 提出通用编码器方法，通过单一编码器适应多种失真和分类（或感知）约束，避免为每个操作点重新训练。实验在MNIST数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在感知图像压缩任务中，通用编码器性能接近单独优化的编码器；但在RDC设置中，重用编码器会导致显著的失真惩罚。

Conclusion: 通用编码器在感知压缩任务中表现良好，但在RDC设置中需谨慎使用，以避免性能下降。

Abstract: In lossy compression, the classical tradeoff between compression rate and
reconstruction distortion has traditionally guided algorithm design. However,
Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced a generalized framework, known as the
rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, incorporating perceptual quality as
an additional dimension of evaluation. More recently, the
rate-distortion-classification (RDC) function was investigated in [19],
evaluating compression performance by considering classification accuracy
alongside distortion. In this paper, we explore universal representations,
where a single encoder is developed to achieve multiple decoding objectives
across various distortion and classification (or perception) constraints. This
universality avoids retraining encoders for each specific operating point
within these tradeoffs. Our experimental validation on the MNIST dataset
indicates that a universal encoder incurs only minimal performance degradation
compared to individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression
tasks, aligning with prior results from [23]. Nonetheless, we also identify
that in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for one specific
classification-distortion tradeoff leads to a significant distortion penalty
when applied to alternative points.

Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement

safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on
manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper
proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the

developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and
accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also
analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum

the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances
the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in
psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models
often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance.
To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal
cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's
negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset,
Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel
synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial
images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses
to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the
therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in
the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror
significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which
outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.

Result: 实验表明，ICAS在结构保持、风格一致性和推理效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: ICAS为多主体风格迁移提供了一种高效可控的新范式，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due
to the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture,
atmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them
across multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models
have achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on
computationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized
datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject
semantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these
limitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention
Structure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject
style transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only
the content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby
preserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability.
By combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for
structural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout
preservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS
introduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables
effective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for
extensive stylized corpora. Extensive experiments show that ICAS achieves
superior performance in structure preservation, style consistency, and
inference efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multi-subject style
transfer in real-world applications.

Conclusion: TRANSAR通过自监督学习和动态采样策略，有效解决了SAR图像目标检测的难题，尤其是小目标检测。

Abstract: Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
holds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster
response. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of
annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object
detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in
satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of
the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise.
Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of
supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we
introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based
SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an
unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2}
ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach
capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate
objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from
the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the
disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive
sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution
during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach
allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3
or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such
as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark
SAR datasets.

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by
enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From
identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting
processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and
sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires
large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when
sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these
challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight
federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and
context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and
leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a
compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across
different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead.
Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the
performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks
from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in
agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖预定义类别，难以应对不可预测的危险，需改进危险检测能力。

Method: 整合视觉语言模型（VLM）和大语言模型（LLM），利用CLIP模型优化目标检测，并扩展COOOL数据集进行评估。

Result: 通过余弦相似度评估语义相似性，展示了方法的有效性，并发布了相关工具和数据集。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前视觉语言方法的优缺点，为未来自动驾驶危险检测系统提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is
a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with
unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object
categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates
vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard
identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language
Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects
within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's
CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving
localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth
dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL
(Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete
natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of
hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine
similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the
predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video.
Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing
large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and
limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into
future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems. Our models,
scripts, and data can be found at https://github.com/mi3labucm/COOOLER.git

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LoRA的持续学习方法，通过冻结关键参数矩阵和正交LoRA组合（LoRAC）来减少遗忘并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有正交LoRA调优方法在持续学习中仍会导致预任务关键参数显著变化，需要改进。

Method: 冻结预任务关键参数矩阵，并结合正交LoRA组合（LoRAC）方法。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100等基准测试中，准确率提升6.35%，遗忘率降低3.24%。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续学习任务中表现出色，达到了SOTA性能。

Abstract: LoRA-based continual learning represents a promising avenue for leveraging
pre-trained models in downstream continual learning tasks. Recent studies have
shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However,
this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters
for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this
problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in
the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In
addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA
composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the
plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known
continual learning benchmarks. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset,
our method shows a 6.35\% improvement in accuracy and a 3.24\% reduction in
forgetting compared to previous methods. Our code is available at

*Hongwei Ji,Wulian Yun,Mengshi Qi,Huadong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Chain-of-Thought文本推理的小样本时序动作定位方法，结合文本语义信息提升定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本TAL方法仅关注视频级信息，忽略了文本信息的语义支持。

Method: 设计了一个结合文本语义的小样本学习框架，包括语义感知的文本-视觉对齐模块和类似Chain-of-Thought的推理方法。

Result: 在ActivityNet1.3和THUMOS14数据集上显著优于现有方法，并探索了人类异常检测应用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过文本推理有效提升了小样本TAL的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts
of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by
using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories.
However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level
information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable
semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new
few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual
reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel
few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to
enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations,
which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align
the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express
the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the
textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought
(CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model
(VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for
videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual
features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available
ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named
Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task
in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance
and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号的非平稳性和被试间变异性对跨被试分类模型提出了挑战，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用SSTAF Transformer架构，结合空间、频谱和时间注意力机制，并利用短时傅里叶变换提取时频特征。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上分别达到76.83%和68.30%的准确率，优于传统CNN和现有Transformer方法。

Conclusion: SSTAF Transformer在运动想象分类任务中表现出色，为神经康复和辅助技术提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor
imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and
assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external
devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant
inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust
cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically
designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists
of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer
block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention
mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across
multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations,
and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to
extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model
to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer
model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI
Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30%
in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures
and a few existing transformer-based approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据增强的模型校准方法CSM，通过生成混合类别的合成样本及其真实不确定性，解决了现有校准方法依赖确定性标签的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准方法依赖确定性标签，无法充分反映模型预测的不确定性，因此需要一种能够生成带有丰富不确定性标注数据的方法。

Method: 提出CSM框架，利用扩散模型生成混合类别样本并标注置信度，同时引入校准重标注解决标注与混合比例不一致的问题。

Result: 实验表明，CSM在校准性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSM通过合成数据和校准重标注，显著提升了模型校准效果。

Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that
accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct.
However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of
one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such
datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge
of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets
with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the
scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as
real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation
to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth
uncertainty. Specifically, we present Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM),
a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class
characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via
diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation
to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the
mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss
functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental
results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the
state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索微调策略对长尾学习性能的影响，发现现有方法存在效率与准确性不足的问题。

Method: 提出LIFT+框架，结合语义感知初始化、极简数据增强和测试时集成，优化一致类别条件。

Result: LIFT+大幅减少训练轮次（从约100降至≤15）和参数（<1%），性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: LIFT+为高效准确的长尾学习提供了新思路，显著优于传统微调方法。

Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing
long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact
of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored.
In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of
fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both
efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning
(fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible
performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning
demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and
empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent
class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this
insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to
optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates
semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time
ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our
framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast
convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+
significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and
learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches
by a considerable margin. The source code is available at

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation is essential for industrial quality, maintenance, and
stability. Existing text-guided zero-shot anomaly segmentation models are
effective but rely on fixed prompts, limiting adaptability in diverse
industrial scenarios. This highlights the need for flexible, context-aware
prompting strategies. We propose Image-Aware Prompt Anomaly Segmentation
(IAP-AS), which enhances anomaly segmentation by generating dynamic,
context-aware prompts using an image tagging model and a large language model
(LLM). IAP-AS extracts object attributes from images to generate context-aware
prompts, improving adaptability and generalization in dynamic and unstructured
industrial environments. In our experiments, IAP-AS improves the F1-max metric
by up to 10%, demonstrating superior adaptability and generalization. It
provides a scalable solution for anomaly segmentation across industries

Result: 在SensatUrban数据集上首次实现城市规模的开放词汇场景理解，展示了高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HAEC为密集城市3D场景的复杂操作提供了新途径，推动了数字孪生处理的进展。

Abstract: Traditional 3D scene understanding techniques are generally predicated on
hand-annotated label sets, but in recent years a new class of open-vocabulary
3D scene understanding techniques has emerged. Despite the success of this
paradigm on small scenes, existing approaches cannot scale efficiently to
city-scale 3D datasets. In this paper, we present Hierarchical vocab-Agnostic
Expert Clustering (HAEC), after the latin word for 'these', a superpoint graph
clustering based approach which utilizes a novel mixture of experts graph
transformer for its backbone. We administer this highly scalable approach to
the first application of open-vocabulary scene understanding on the SensatUrban
city-scale dataset. We also demonstrate a synthetic labeling pipeline which is
derived entirely from the raw point clouds with no hand-annotation. Our
technique can help unlock complex operations on dense urban 3D scenes and open
a new path forward in the processing of digital twins.

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种解决神经网络频谱偏差的技术：傅里叶特征编码（FFE）和多网格参数编码（MPE），发现MPE在细节学习和性能上优于FFE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在低维空间映射中无法学习高频信息的问题，并比较FFE和MPE两种技术的性能差异。

Method: 使用神经切线核（NTK）分析FFE和MPE的性能差异，并通过实验验证在2D图像回归和3D隐式表面回归任务上的表现。

Result: MPE在频谱上比基线提高了8个数量级，比FFE提高了2个数量级，PSNR和MS-SSIM指标显著优于FFE。

Conclusion: MPE通过网格结构而非嵌入空间提升性能，其机制与FFE不同，且在细节学习上表现更优。

Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in
computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive
implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present
a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for
mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid
parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional
mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher
resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it
susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid
structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in
performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings
through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on
the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's
performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable
embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely
solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically
validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym
sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the
Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details
are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders
of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The
increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase
over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.

Motivation: 地面位移测量对地质研究至关重要，但直接测量不切实际。传统方法依赖光学卫星图像的块匹配，而深度学习模型在实际应用中面临缺乏真实数据、亚像素精度需求等挑战。

Result: 模型在半合成基准测试中显著优于传统地球物理方法，并在真实场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为地面位移测量提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案，适用于多种传感器数据。

Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but
are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are
estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different
acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising,
their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as
the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and
temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular,
we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers
struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead,
we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping
layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision.
Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves
fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model
significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic
benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by
both medium- and high-resolution sensors. Project page:

Conclusion: AnyTSR为无人机热成像提供了一种高效、灵活的任意尺度超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low
resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred
boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this
issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are
computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address
above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR)
for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to
explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible
representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset
information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler
is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts.
Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is
constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all
scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution
images. The code is located at https://github.com/vision4robotics/AnyTSR.

Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and
needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification.
We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and
biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving
into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization
techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for
breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI
and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past
and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the
causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature
co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable
predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that
integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and
prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological
vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a
connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall,
our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for
medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and
radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak
causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve
performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical
domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit
motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward
human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and
clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy,
and safe deployment.

Result: 在空间一致性基准测试中，性能提升13.33%，优于当前最佳方法CoMPaSS。

Conclusion: ESPLoRA和TORE算法有效提升了生成图像的空间一致性，且不增加计算成本或降低输出质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing
high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly
render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack
of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use
external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher
computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated
dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized
from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and
spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible
fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to
enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation
time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we
propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing
3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These
metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully
mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further
improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the
current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial
consistency benchmarks.

Conclusion: CMSwinKAN为病理图像分类提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid
malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and
accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide
images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices
primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to
inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification
methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature
extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their
practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model
tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin
Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its
multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving
both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and
leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians'
comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue
characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism
guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to
whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs
dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and
the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN
performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models
pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）和分解低秩适应（DoRA）调整注意力权重，实现参数高效适应；通过减少跨模态纠缠，支持单模态更新。

Result: 在PET扫描上Dice分数提升28%，参数仅为早期融合的8%；预后任务中，适应PET后一致性指数提升10%，适应PET和EHR后提升23%。

Conclusion: PEMMA框架在参数效率和性能上均优于传统方法，为多模态医学影像分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging,
particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise
in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a
critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for
training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of
PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework
that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted
for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a
parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight
upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans
such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become
available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task
maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed
approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR
and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage
the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the
attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by
minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one
modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method
achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the
trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score
improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in
prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a
CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both
PET and EHR data.

### [151] [Decoding Vision Transformers: the Diffusion Steering Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13763)
*Ryota Takatsuki,Sonia Joseph,Ippei Fujisawa,Ryota Kanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Diffusion Steering Lens（DSL）的新方法，用于改进Vision Transformers（ViTs）中内部表示的可视化，解决了现有方法（如Logit Lens和Diffusion Lens）的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logit Lens和Diffusion Lens在分析ViTs时存在不足，无法捕捉视觉表示的丰富性或直接贡献。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DSL方法，通过引导子模块输出并修补后续间接贡献，无需训练即可实现ViTs内部处理的直观解释。

Result: 通过干预研究验证，DSL能够提供直观且可靠的ViTs内部处理解释。

Conclusion: DSL是一种有效的训练免费方法，能够改进ViTs的可解释性。

Abstract: Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of
transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal
representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output
vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is
technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the
richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al.
(2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize
intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion
models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize
residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the
direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach
that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We
validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides
an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了基于深度隐写嵌入的脆弱水印技术，用于验证ICAO标准面部图像的真实性，防止篡改和退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代身份验证系统依赖面部图像，但图像可能被篡改或退化，威胁安全性。

Method: 通过深度隐写嵌入在官方照片中隐藏图像，建立完整性标记，并设计分类框架检测篡改类型。

Result: 实验显示高检测准确率，支持脆弱水印技术的可行性。

Conclusion: 深度隐写嵌入的脆弱水印是验证生物特征文档完整性的有效工具。

Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images
embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global
interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards
defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify
acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these
images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or
malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition
systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep
steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity
of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the
official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that
becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of
image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that
degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we
propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect
and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate
high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep
steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile
watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric
document integrity verification.

Motivation: 现有多智能体通信方法存在带宽需求高、异构性和信息丢失等问题，LangCoop旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出LangCoop框架，包含M³CoT（结构化零样本视觉语言推理）和LangPack（高效语言信息封装）。

Result: 实验显示LangCoop通信带宽降低96%（每条消息<2KB），驾驶性能与图像通信相当。

Conclusion: LangCoop为多智能体协作提供了一种高效且性能优越的通信范式。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration holds great promise for enhancing the safety,
reliability, and mobility of autonomous driving systems by enabling information
sharing among multiple connected agents. However, existing multi-agent
communication approaches are hindered by limitations of existing communication
media, including high bandwidth demands, agent heterogeneity, and information
loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LangCoop, a new paradigm for
collaborative autonomous driving that leverages natural language as a compact
yet expressive medium for inter-agent communication. LangCoop features two key
innovations: Mixture Model Modular Chain-of-thought (M$^3$CoT) for structured
zero-shot vision-language reasoning and Natural Language Information Packaging
(LangPack) for efficiently packaging information into concise, language-based
messages. Through extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulations, we
demonstrate that LangCoop achieves a remarkable 96\% reduction in communication
bandwidth (< 2KB per message) compared to image-based communication, while
maintaining competitive driving performance in the closed-loop evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Modality (CoM)的方法，通过结合视觉、肌肉活动和音频信号，使机器人能够从人类视频中学习任务计划和控制参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视频无法完全捕捉任务执行中的控制参数变化（如力），因此需要多模态数据来增强学习效果。

Method: 利用臂带和麦克风等设备捕捉人类操作过程中的肌肉活动和声音信号，结合视觉数据，通过CoM策略逐步整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，CoM在提取任务计划和控制参数方面的准确性比基线方法提高了三倍，并在真实机器人实验中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoM通过多模态数据显著提升了机器人从人类视频中学习任务的能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising
approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing
control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data
alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as
armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record
sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable
robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task.
To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy
that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human
demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By
progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task
plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform
manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our
experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for
extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong
generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

Result: 在CODa基准测试中表现优于现有方法，检测mAP提升2.03%，行人轨迹预测误差减少0.408m。系统在低端GPU上实现13.2 fps实时推理。

Conclusion: 该系统高效且易于部署，代码已开源，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while
performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational
resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object
detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates
LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians,
vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1)
a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high
accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference
Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse
trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths.
Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over
existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction
(-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits
exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an
entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To
facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related
code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS

Motivation: 软体机器人因其柔顺性和安全性适用于手术等场景，但其非线性滞后行为对建模和控制提出了挑战。

Method: 提出滞后感知的神经网络模型，构建并行仿真环境，应用强化学习训练控制策略，并通过物理实验验证。

Result: 滞后感知建模将MSE降低84.95%，控制算法在真实机器人上实现0.126-0.250 mm的轨迹跟踪误差。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术实验中表现优异，展示了其在复杂临床场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them
particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction
with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and
hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents
substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we
present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a
hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and
predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior.
Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel
simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control
strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic
system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser
ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that
the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95
percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control
algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm
on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions.
The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical
experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including
future real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有模型在预测车辆轨迹时独立处理每个时间点的预测，无法纠正推理中的错误，导致重复误差。

Method: 提出一种回顾技术，通过闭环训练使模型能够利用反馈信息，分析并纠正之前的预测错误。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse数据集上，最小平均位移误差降低了31.9%，且在处理分布外场景时表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 回顾技术显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles
supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego
vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task
of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time
proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which
means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat
them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a
novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the
model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on
previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of
subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors
during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse
demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up
to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We
further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better
handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.

Motivation: 在模仿学习中，人类示范数据虽易于收集，但现有方法难以精确推断动作、弥补本体差异，并与前沿机器人训练流程融合。

Method: 通过为手持夹爪分配独特颜色，利用RANSAC和ICP配准方法精确估计末端执行器姿态。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了人类示范数据的精确性问题，并提升了机器人策略的性能。

Abstract: Within the imitation learning paradigm, training generalist robots requires
large-scale datasets obtainable only through diverse curation. Due to the
relative ease to collect, human demonstrations constitute a valuable addition
when incorporated appropriately. However, existing methods utilizing human
demonstrations face challenges in inferring precise actions, ameliorating
embodiment gaps, and fusing with frontier generalist robot training pipelines.
In this work, building on prior studies that demonstrate the viability of using
hand-held grippers for efficient data collection, we leverage the user's
control over the gripper's appearance--specifically by assigning it a unique,
easily segmentable color--to enable simple and reliable application of the
RANSAC and ICP registration method for precise end-effector pose estimation. We
show in simulation that precisely labeled human demonstrations on their own
allow policies to reach on average 88.1% of the performance of using robot
demonstrations, and boost policy performance when combined with robot
demonstrations, despite the inherent embodiment gap.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了量子退火处理器中的minor-embedding问题，分析了嵌入质量对性能的影响，并评估了Minorminer算法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子退火器在解决适合其架构的问题时表现优异，但对于非硬件原生拓扑的问题存在性能差距，因此研究嵌入质量的影响至关重要。

Method: 通过实验分析嵌入质量（如平均链长）对解误差的影响，并评估Minorminer算法的嵌入能力、质量和鲁棒性，同时与Clique Embedding进行对比。

Result: 实验表明嵌入质量显著影响量子退火性能，而Minorminer在表现上并未始终优于最坏情况（Clique Embedding），存在改进空间。

Conclusion: 嵌入质量对量子退火性能至关重要，Minorminer算法虽广泛使用，但仍有提升空间，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the
variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary
motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers
when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with
non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to
analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems
quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated
by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the
standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first
objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain
length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This
underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing
performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique,
assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings
produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance
with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is
deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum
annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate
that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not
consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.

Result: 数值模拟显示，该方法在分类任务中优于传统VQC，资源效率更高。

Conclusion: 动态可观测算符框架为量子神经网络提供了更强大且灵活的设计思路。

Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning
typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli
operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local
measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the
quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with
evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing
a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs
are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with
non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture,
admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are
introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our
approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and
resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.

Abstract: This article considers the problem of designing adaption and optimisation
techniques for training quantum learning machines. To this end, the division
algebra of quaternions is used to derive an effective model for representing

serves as the foundation for formulating an adaptive learning problem on
principal quantum learning units, thereby establishing quantum information
processing units akin to that of neurons in classical approaches. Then,
leveraging the modern HR-calculus, a comprehensive training framework for
learning on quantum machines is developed. The quaternion-valued model
accommodates mathematical tractability and establishment of performance

Conclusion: VBGs是构建可扩展高性能量子网络的有力工具，尤其适合与近期量子硬件结合使用。

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical
challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These
fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of
repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a
promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional
fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we
demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended,
resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and
operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify
performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters.
Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by
eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from
improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error
correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced
response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains
primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These
findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced
photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying
error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for
scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with
near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验证明了该攻击方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CheatAgent展示了LLM作为攻击代理的潜力，为推荐系统的安全性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys)
have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have
attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research
question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still
remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it
is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers
can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack
approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for
attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing
complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs
provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys
because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making
processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called
CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an
LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our
method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal
input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate
adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the
quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to
improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively.
Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.

Abstract: Objective: This review explores the trustworthiness of multimodal artificial
intelligence (AI) systems, specifically focusing on vision-language tasks. It
addresses critical challenges related to fairness, transparency, and ethical
implications in these systems, providing a comparative analysis of key tasks
such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), image captioning, and visual dialogue.
Background: Multimodal models, particularly vision-language models, enhance
artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by integrating visual and textual
data, mimicking human learning processes. Despite significant advancements, the
trustworthiness of these models remains a crucial concern, particularly as AI
systems increasingly confront issues regarding fairness, transparency, and
ethics. Methods: This review examines research conducted from 2017 to 2024
focusing on forenamed core vision-language tasks. It employs a comparative
approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness,
underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics. This study synthesizes
findings from recent literature to identify trends, challenges, and
state-of-the-art solutions. Results: Several key findings were highlighted.
Transparency: Explainability of vision language tasks is important for user
trust. Techniques, such as attention maps and gradient-based methods, have
successfully addressed this issue. Fairness: Bias mitigation in VQA and visual
dialogue systems is essential for ensuring unbiased outcomes across diverse
demographic groups. Ethical Implications: Addressing biases in multilingual
models and ensuring ethical data handling is critical for the responsible
deployment of vision-language systems. Conclusion: This study underscores the
importance of integrating fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations in
developing vision-language models within a unified framework.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: X-Teaming是一个可扩展框架，用于系统研究多轮对话中的安全风险，生成攻击场景，并在多轮越狱攻击中达到98.1%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中的安全风险尚未充分研究，现有工作多集中于单轮攻击，而多轮攻击的适应性和多样性是主要挑战。

Method: X-Teaming采用协作代理进行规划、攻击优化和验证，生成多轮攻击场景。

Result: X-Teaming在多轮越狱攻击中表现优异，成功率达98.1%，并针对Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型达到96.2%的成功率。

Conclusion: X-Teaming和XGuard-Train数据集为提升语言模型的多轮安全性提供了重要工具和资源。

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety
risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the
vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while
adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn
red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable
framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions
escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios.
X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and
verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and
diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading
open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2%
attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been
considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we
introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that
is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive
jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our
work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated
conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

*Houssam Kherraz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文主张通过硬件层加密签名可信内容，而非AI生成内容，提出硬件认证是更可行的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI输出越来越逼真，检测AI生成内容的需求增加，但现有水印和检测技术存在严重局限。

Method: 提出通过硬件传感器对真实内容进行加密签名，建立社会技术框架，类比HTTPS认证和蓝光验证协议。

Result: 硬件认证为政策层面提供了更可行的路径，尤其在视听内容领域。

Conclusion: 建议研究社区应警惕对AI水印的过度乐观，将精力集中在文本和LLM领域，因其无法追溯到物理传感器。

Abstract: As generative AI models produce increasingly realistic output, both academia
and industry are focusing on the ability to detect whether an output was
generated by an AI model or not. Many of the research efforts and policy
discourse are centered around robust watermarking of AI outputs. While plenty
of progress has been made, all watermarking and AI detection techniques face
severe limitations. In this position paper, we argue that we are adopting the
wrong approach, and should instead focus on watermarking via cryptographic
signatures trustworthy content rather than AI generated ones. For audio-visual
content, in particular, all real content is grounded in the physical world and
captured via hardware sensors. This presents a unique opportunity to watermark
at the hardware layer, and we lay out a socio-technical framework and draw
parallels with HTTPS certification and Blu-Ray verification protocols. While
acknowledging implementation challenges, we contend that hardware-based
authentication offers a more tractable path forward, particularly from a policy
perspective. As generative models approach perceptual indistinguishability, the
research community should be wary of being overly optimistic with AI
watermarking, and we argue that AI watermarking research efforts are better
spent in the text and LLM space, which are ultimately not traceable to a
physical sensor.

### [168] [On the Feasibility of Using MultiModal LLMs to Execute AR Social Engineering Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13209)
*Ting Bi,Chenghang Ye,Zheyu Yang,Ziyi Zhou,Cui Tang,Jun Zhang,Zui Tao,Kailong Wang,Liting Zhou,Yang Yang,Tianlong Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了SEAR框架，首次系统研究了利用多模态大语言模型（LLM）和增强现实（AR）技术进行社交工程攻击的可行性，并通过实验验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR和多模态LLM的快速发展为社交工程攻击提供了新的攻击面，本文旨在探索其潜在威胁。

Method: SEAR框架通过三个阶段实现攻击：AR社交上下文合成、基于角色的多模态RAG和ReInteract社交工程代理，并在实验中验证其效果。

Result: 实验结果显示SEAR框架在诱导高风险行为（如钓鱼邮件）和建立信任方面非常有效，但也存在感知真实性不足的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文为AR-LLM驱动的社交工程攻击提供了概念验证，并为防御下一代AR威胁提供了见解。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are
rapidly evolving, providing unprecedented capabilities for human-computer
interaction. However, their integration introduces a new attack surface for
social engineering. In this paper, we systematically investigate the
feasibility of orchestrating AR-driven Social Engineering attacks using
Multimodal LLM for the first time, via our proposed SEAR framework, which
operates through three key phases: (1) AR-based social context synthesis, which
fuses Multimodal inputs (visual, auditory and environmental cues); (2)
role-based Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which dynamically
retrieves and integrates contextual data while preserving character
differentiation; and (3) ReInteract social engineering agents, which execute
adaptive multiphase attack strategies through inference interaction loops. To
verify SEAR, we conducted an IRB-approved study with 60 participants in three
experimental configurations (unassisted, AR+LLM, and full SEAR pipeline)
compiling a new dataset of 180 annotated conversations in simulated social
scenarios. Our results show that SEAR is highly effective at eliciting
high-risk behaviors (e.g., 93.3% of participants susceptible to email
phishing). The framework was particularly effective in building trust, with 85%
of targets willing to accept an attacker's call after an interaction. Also, we
identified notable limitations such as ``occasionally artificial'' due to
perceived authenticity gaps. This work provides proof-of-concept for AR-LLM
driven social engineering attacks and insights for developing defensive
countermeasures against next-generation augmented reality threats.

*CheolWon Na,YunSeok Choi,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需查询目标模型的黑盒攻击方法Q-faker，通过替代模型生成对抗样本，解决了现有方法依赖目标模型信息和高成本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要大量查询和目标模型信息，不适用于目标模型封闭且不可访问的硬黑盒场景。

Method: 使用替代模型生成对抗句子，结合受控生成技术，实现目标无关攻击。

Result: 在八个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，包括高迁移性和高质量的对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: Q-faker在硬黑盒场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Many adversarial attack approaches are proposed to verify the vulnerability
of language models. However, they require numerous queries and the information
on the target model. Even black-box attack methods also require the target
model's output information. They are not applicable in real-world scenarios, as
in hard black-box settings where the target model is closed and inaccessible.
Even the recently proposed hard black-box attacks still require many queries
and demand extremely high costs for training adversarial generators. To address
these challenges, we propose Q-faker (Query-free Hard Black-box Attacker), a
novel and efficient method that generates adversarial examples without
accessing the target model. To avoid accessing the target model, we use a
surrogate model instead. The surrogate model generates adversarial sentences
for a target-agnostic attack. During this process, we leverage controlled
generation techniques. We evaluate our proposed method on eight datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's effectiveness including high
transferability and the high quality of the generated adversarial examples, and
prove its practical in hard black-box settings.

*Andrew J. Lohn*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI对网络冲突的影响，分析了进攻和防御优势的多种论点，并总结了44种AI可能改变网络冲突平衡的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络领域因其数字化特性与AI训练和应用的紧密反馈循环，可能成为AI影响最大且最早的领域之一，因此需要理解AI如何改变网络冲突。

Method: 通过文献综述，收集了关于网络冲突中进攻和防御优势的论点，并分析了AI对这些论点的影响。

Result: 网络领域过于复杂，无法简单判断AI是否整体增强进攻或防御，AI会改善某些方面、阻碍其他方面，同时保持某些不变。

Conclusion: AI对网络冲突的影响是多方面的，论文总结了44种具体影响方式。

Abstract: Unlike other domains of conflict, and unlike other fields with high
anticipated risk from AI, the cyber domain is intrinsically digital with a
tight feedback loop between AI training and cyber application. Cyber may have
some of the largest and earliest impacts from AI, so it is important to
understand how the cyber domain may change as AI continues to advance. Our
approach reviewed the literature, collecting nine arguments that have been
proposed for offensive advantage in cyber conflict and nine proposed arguments
for defensive advantage. We include an additional forty-eight arguments that
have been proposed to give cyber conflict and competition its character as
collected separately by Healey, Jervis, and Nandrajog. We then consider how
each of those arguments and propositions might change with varying degrees of
AI advancement. We find that the cyber domain is too multifaceted for a single
answer to whether AI will enhance offense or defense broadly. AI will improve
some aspects, hinder others, and leave some aspects unchanged. We collect and
present forty-four ways that we expect AI to impact the cyber offense-defense
balance and the character of cyber conflict and competition.

*Jirui Yang,Zheyu Lin,Shuhan Yang,Zhihui Lu,Xin Du*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概念增强工程（CEE）的新防御框架，通过动态引导大型语言模型（LLM）的内部激活来增强其安全性，有效抵御越狱攻击，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御策略（如输入过滤和输出监控）在实时场景中可能引入高计算开销或干扰任务性能，因此需要一种更高效且不影响性能的安全机制。

Method: CEE通过提取多语言安全模式、构建基于安全对齐概念子空间的控制方向，并应用子空间概念旋转来增强推理过程中的安全行为。

Result: 实验表明，CEE在抵御越狱攻击方面优于现有防御方法，同时在鲁棒性和效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: CEE为具身AI提供了一种可扩展且可解释的安全机制，填补了理论表示工程与实际安全应用之间的空白，展示了潜在空间干预作为防御范式的潜力。

Abstract: Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems integrated with large language models
(LLMs) face significant security risks, particularly from jailbreak attacks
that manipulate models into generating harmful outputs or executing unsafe
physical actions. Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and
output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere
with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense
framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of
embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates
by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2)
constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and
(3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during
inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak
attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense
methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and
interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between
theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our
findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable
defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该技术报告比较了传统机器学习（SVM、KNN、决策树）和深度学习（CNN）在恶意软件分类中的表现。传统方法使用手工特征（1-gram和2-gram），而CNN自动提取特征。结果显示SVM表现最佳，但CNN具有自动特征提取的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估传统机器学习和深度学习在恶意软件分类中的效果，探索自动特征提取的潜力。

Method: 传统方法使用n-gram分析和SVM、KNN、决策树；深度学习方法采用CNN自动提取特征。

Result: SVM在传统方法中表现最佳，CNN性能接近且具有自动特征提取的优势。

Conclusion: CNN在恶意软件分类中具有潜力，尤其是自动特征提取的能力，但传统方法（如SVM）仍具竞争力。

Abstract: This technical report presents a comprehensive analysis of malware
classification using OpCode sequences. Two distinct approaches are evaluated:
traditional machine learning using n-gram analysis with Support Vector Machine
(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers; and a deep
learning approach employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The
traditional machine learning approach establishes a baseline using handcrafted
1-gram and 2-gram features from disassembled malware samples. The deep learning
methodology builds upon the work proposed in "Deep Android Malware Detection"
by McLaughlin et al. and evaluates the performance of a CNN model trained to
automatically extract features from raw OpCode data. Empirical results are
compared using standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score). While the SVM classifier outperforms other traditional techniques,
the CNN model demonstrates competitive performance with the added benefit of
automated feature extraction.

*Felix Mächtle,Nils Loose,Tim Schulz,Florian Sieck,Jan-Niclas Serr,Ralf Möller,Thomas Eisenbarth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Trace Gadgets的代码表示方法，通过最小化代码上下文并移除无关代码，优化了机器学习模型在漏洞检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网应用和API端点的增加，漏洞数量上升，手动检测效率低，静态扫描器误报率高，机器学习方法在训练与测试数据相关性强时表现良好，但代码上下文过长会影响模型性能。

Method: 引入Trace Gadgets，一种新型代码表示方法，通过精确捕获漏洞路径的语句，提供最小但完整的上下文作为ML模型的输入。

Result: 实验表明，Trace Gadgets优于现有代码表示方法，性能提升至少4%，并在实际应用中发现了未知漏洞。

Conclusion: Trace Gadgets显著提升了机器学习模型在漏洞检测中的性能，且在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As the number of web applications and API endpoints exposed to the Internet
continues to grow, so does the number of exploitable vulnerabilities. Manually
identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security
scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based
approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where
training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based
vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as
excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities
of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones.
  This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that
minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely
capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for
ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby
improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset
generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further
improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show
that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace
Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection
capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at
least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world
applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in
widely deployed software.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 基础模型（如GFMs）在网络安全中的应用潜力，通过横向移动检测案例展示了无需领域数据训练即可达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在机器学习中广泛应用，但网络安全领域因数据处理问题而受限，GFMs可能解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的图基础模型（GFM）构建横向移动检测器，无需领域数据训练。

Result: 检测器在横向移动检测中达到先进性能。

Conclusion: GFMs在网络安全中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have recently emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning
(ML). These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can
subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no
retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML
applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption
of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to
efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary
executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could
make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these
types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens
of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a
pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance
without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus
provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文评估了七种大语言模型（LLMs）在WebShell检测中的表现，并提出了BFAD框架以提升性能。结果表明，较大LLMs精度高但召回率低，而BFAD显著提升了所有模型的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习方法在WebShell检测中存在数据需求大、泛化能力差等问题，LLMs的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了BFAD框架，包括关键功能过滤器、上下文感知代码提取和加权行为功能分析，以优化LLMs在WebShell检测中的应用。

Result: 较大LLMs（如GPT-4）在BFAD支持下超越传统方法，较小LLMs性能与传统方法相当，平均F1分数提升13.82%。

Conclusion: LLMs在WebShell检测中具有潜力，BFAD框架有效解决了其应用中的挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: WebShell attacks, in which malicious scripts are injected into web servers,
are a major cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep
learning methods are hampered by issues such as the need for extensive training
data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their
potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make
two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs,
including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against
traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP
scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework,
designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain.
Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that
isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy
that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted
Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by
prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative
function-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect
precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite
trade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1
score increase of 13.82%. Larger models such as GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen
2.5 14B outperform SOTA methods, while smaller models such as Qwen 2.5 3B
achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the
first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell
detection, and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

Result: 这些技术提高了准确性、解决了数据稀缺问题，并支持隐私保护下的协作学习。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者和从业者提供了当前趋势的见解，并指导未来深度学习在癌症检测中的研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare,
particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional
machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying
diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive
analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies
focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact.
This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including
transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL),
Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance
accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while
maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets,
improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic
pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model
development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs,
traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical
data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these
techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data
imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and
practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future
research in advanced DL for cancer detection.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤因其侵袭性和早期诊断困难而成为癌症治疗中的重大挑战，现有分割方法计算资源需求高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了双解码器U-Net架构，加入注意力门控跳跃连接，优化训练效率。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上，仅50轮训练即达到WT 85.06%、TC 80.61%、ET 71.26%的Dice分数，优于常见U-Net变体。

Conclusion: 该模型在有限计算资源下仍能实现高质量分割，为资源受限环境下的脑肿瘤早期诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and among
its many forms, brain tumors are particularly notorious due to their aggressive
nature and the critical challenges involved in early diagnosis. Recent advances
in artificial intelligence have shown great promise in assisting medical
professionals with precise tumor segmentation, a key step in timely diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, many state-of-the-art segmentation methods
require extensive computational resources and prolonged training times,
limiting their practical application in resource-constrained settings. In this
work, we present a novel dual-decoder U-Net architecture enhanced with
attention-gated skip connections, designed specifically for brain tumor
segmentation from MRI scans. Our approach balances efficiency and accuracy by
achieving competitive segmentation performance while significantly reducing
training demands. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, the proposed model
achieved Dice scores of 85.06% for Whole Tumor (WT), 80.61% for Tumor Core
(TC), and 71.26% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) in only 50 epochs, surpassing several
commonly used U-Net variants. Our model demonstrates that high-quality brain
tumor segmentation is attainable even under limited computational resources,
thereby offering a viable solution for researchers and clinicians operating
with modest hardware. This resource-efficient model has the potential to
improve early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, ultimately contributing
to better patient outcomes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半月板损伤可能导致膝关节骨关节炎，目前缺乏有效疗法。自动分割技术有助于早期检测和治疗。

Method: 研究比较了SAM（仅微调解码器和端到端微调）与3D U-Net在半月板分割中的表现。

Result: SAM端到端微调后Dice分数为0.87±0.03，与3D U-Net相当，但在Hausdorff距离上表现较差。

Conclusion: 尽管SAM具有通用性，但在3D医学图像分割任务中可能不适用于低对比度和边界模糊的精细结构。

Abstract: Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to
joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and
progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of
disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated
segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of
meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci
play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of
convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large
vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a
so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a
range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the
model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation
of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained
as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was
unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$,
compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM
end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both
the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to
the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation
Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both
configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus
morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was
unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be
suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine
anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.

*Racheal Mukisa,Arvind K. Bansal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进心脏磁共振（CMR）图像语义分割的模型，通过提取边缘属性和上下文信息，提升了左心室腔、右心室腔和左心室心肌的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early
detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management.
Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac
images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their
morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and
diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases,
abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic
segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its
subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including
abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle
abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this
paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The
model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of
the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three
major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity
(RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance
results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using
similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our
approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers
Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.

*Racheal Mukisa,Arvind K. Bansal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的改进模型，用于心脏磁共振图像中左右心室和心肌瘢痕组织的分割，结合了UNet、通道和空间注意力、边缘检测跳跃连接和深度监督学习，显著提高了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振图像分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有方法在准确性和鲁棒性上仍有不足。

Method: 采用多通道处理图像生成特征图，结合双注意力机制（通道和空间注意力），利用边缘检测改进跳跃连接，并通过深度监督减少梯度消失问题。

Result: 模型表现出色，Dice相似性分数达98%，Hausdorff距离显著降低，优于其他领先技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在心脏磁共振图像分割中具有高精度和鲁棒性，为临床诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of
the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and
spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised
learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are
processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a
dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use
of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from
feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems
inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for
dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance
results are described. The performance results show that this approach has
attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower
Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading
techniques both in DSC and HD.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FocusNet是一种基于Transformer的注意力网络，用于改进息肉分割，通过多模块设计在多模态和多中心数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在息肉分割中多基于单模态和单中心数据，难以适应真实临床环境。

Method: FocusNet包含三个模块：CIDM生成粗分割图，DEM优化浅层特征，FAM通过局部和池化注意力机制平衡细节与全局上下文。

Result: 在PolypDB数据集上，FocusNet在五种模态上的Dice系数分别为82.47%（BLI）、88.46%（FICE）、92.04%（LCI）、82.09%（NBI）和93.42%（WLI）。

Conclusion: FocusNet在多模态和多中心数据中表现出色，优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Colonoscopy is vital in the early diagnosis of colorectal polyps. Regular
screenings can effectively prevent benign polyps from progressing to CRC. While
deep learning has made impressive strides in polyp segmentation, most existing
models are trained on single-modality and single-center data, making them less
effective in real-world clinical environments. To overcome these limitations,
we propose FocusNet, a Transformer-enhanced focus attention network designed to
improve polyp segmentation. FocusNet incorporates three essential modules: the
Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for generating coarse
segmentation maps, the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow
features, and the Focus Attention Module (FAM), to balance local detail and
global context through local and pooling attention mechanisms. We evaluate our
model on PolypDB, a newly introduced dataset with multi-modality and
multi-center data for building more reliable segmentation methods. Extensive
experiments showed that FocusNet consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches with a high dice coefficients of 82.47% on the BLI
modality, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on the NBI and 93.42% on WLI
modality, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness across five different
modalities. The source code for FocusNet is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的自监督单图像去噪框架Filter2Noise（F2N），通过注意力引导的双边滤波器和轻量级模块实现用户可控的去噪，并在低剂量CT数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督方法依赖配对数据、自监督方法依赖多噪声图像且缺乏机制解释的问题。

Method: 引入注意力引导的双边滤波器，通过轻量级模块预测空间变化的滤波器参数，并提出新的下采样策略和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在Mayo Clinic 2016低剂量CT数据集上，PSNR比ZS-N2N高4.59 dB，同时提升透明度和用户控制。

Conclusion: F2N为医学应用提供了精确且可解释的去噪方法，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures
and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods
struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often
require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering
little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we
propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework --
Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral
Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that
predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and
adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of
interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling
shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the
concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated
noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading
self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving
transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide
key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable
noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at

Method: ALDA4Rec构建物品-物品图，通过社区检测去噪，结合GCN学习短期表示，利用平均、GRU和注意力机制建模长期嵌入，并采用MLP自适应权重策略优化用户偏好。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，ALDA4Rec在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ALDA4Rec通过去噪和动态优化长期偏好，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the internet has made personalized recommendation systems
indispensable. Graph-based sequential recommendation systems, powered by Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), effectively capture complex user-item interactions but
often face challenges such as noise and static representations. In this paper,
we introduce the Adaptive Long-term Embedding with Denoising and Augmentation
for Recommendation (ALDA4Rec) method, a novel model that constructs an
item-item graph, filters noise through community detection, and enriches
user-item interactions. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are then employed
to learn short-term representations, while averaging, GRUs, and attention
mechanisms are utilized to model long-term embeddings. An MLP-based adaptive
weighting strategy is further incorporated to dynamically optimize long-term
user preferences. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate
that ALDA4Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering notable
improvements in both accuracy and robustness. The source code is available at

Abstract: This review is focused on the data-driven approaches applied in different
applications of Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) of speech. This review
paper considered the relevant works published in the last ten years
(2011-2021). The selection criteria includes (a) type of AAI - Speaker
Dependent and Speaker Independent AAI, (b) objectives of the work -
Articulatory approximation, Articulatory Feature space selection and Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR), explore the correlation between acoustic and
articulatory features, and framework for Computer-assisted language training,
(c) Corpus - Simultaneously recorded speech (wav) and medical imaging models
such as ElectroMagnetic Articulography (EMA), Electropalatography (EPG),
Laryngography, Electroglottography (EGG), X-ray Cineradiography, Ultrasound,
and real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI), (d) Methods or models -
recent works are considered, and therefore all the works are based on machine
learning, (e) Evaluation - as AAI is a non-linear regression problem, the
performance evaluation is mostly done by Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), and also considered Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean
Format Error (MFE). The practical application of the AAI model can provide a
better and user-friendly interpretable image feedback system of articulatory

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CLOT-GAN的新型GAN模型，通过多判别器学习和最优传输损失提升语音转换的自然度和数据分布匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN语音转换模型在自然度上存在明显差距，且单生成器单判别器学习难以优化目标数据分布。

Method: 引入多判别器（DCNN、ViT、Conformer）和最优传输损失，通过集体学习机制理解梅尔谱的共振峰分布。

Result: 在VCC 2018、VCTK和CMU-Arctic数据集上，CLOT-GAN-VC在客观和主观评估中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CLOT-GAN通过多判别器和OT损失显著提升了语音转换的性能和自然度。

Abstract: After demonstrating significant success in image synthesis, Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) models have likewise made significant progress in the
field of speech synthesis, leveraging their capacity to adapt the precise
distribution of target data through adversarial learning processes. Notably, in
the realm of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) GAN-based Voice Conversion (VC) models,
there exists a substantial disparity in naturalness between real and
GAN-generated speech samples. Furthermore, while many GAN models currently
operate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing
target data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single
generator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a
novel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN
(CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and
conformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their
ability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated
by a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal
Transport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and
target data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory. The
experimental validation on VCC 2018, VCTK, and CMU-Arctic datasets confirms
that the CLOT-GAN-VC model outperforms existing VC models in objective and
subjective assessments.

TL;DR: 本文综述了跨文化认知评估工具的方法论与统计验证，强调文化适应需结合社区反馈、标准化翻译和统计验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同文化背景下认知评估工具的适应性与有效性，为全球多样化健康环境提供依据。

Method: 分析了欧洲、亚洲、非洲和南美洲的六项研究，评估文化适应方法及统计验证结果。

Result: 教育解释了26.76%的MoCA-H分数差异，文化语言因素在欧洲适应中占6.89%。巴西土著人群的MMSE和BCSB表现出色（敏感性94.4%，特异性99.2%）。

Conclusion: 文化适应需结合社区反馈、标准化翻译和统计验证，为全球认知评估工具开发提供框架。

Abstract: This systematic review discusses the methodological approaches and
statistical confirmations of cross-cultural adaptations of cognitive evaluation
tools used with different populations. The review considers six seminal studies
on the methodology of cultural adaptation in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South
America. The results indicate that proper adaptations need holistic models with
demographic changes, and education explained as much as 26.76% of the variance
in MoCA-H scores. Cultural-linguistic factors explained 6.89% of the variance
in European adaptations of MoCA-H; however, another study on adapted MMSE and
BCSB among Brazilian Indigenous populations reported excellent diagnostic
performance, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 99.2%. There was
78.5% inter-rater agreement on the evaluation of cultural adaptation using the
Manchester Translation Evaluation Checklist. A paramount message of the paper
is that community feedback is necessary for culturally appropriate preparation,
standardized translation protocols also must be included, along with robust
statistical validation methodologies for developing cognitive assessment
instruments. This review supplies evidence-based frameworks for the further
adaptation of cognitive assessments in increasingly diverse global health
settings.

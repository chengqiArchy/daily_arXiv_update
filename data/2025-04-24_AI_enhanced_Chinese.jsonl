In this survey, we systematically\nintroduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the\nbackground, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using\nDNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to\ntheir generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general\nmodels. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur\nwithin the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for\nspecialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features,\nsamples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining\nhigh-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are\npre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream\ntasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources,\nor even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also\nknown as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing\ndirect application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning.

In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection\nframework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution\nfor LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically,\nwe first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain\nclassification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity.\nQuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that\ndetermines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality\nand diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal\nparameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments\non smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the\nRegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate\nthat QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across\nmultiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for\nquality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data\nquality and diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "QuaDMix\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u8861\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LightGBM\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQuaDMix\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53477.2%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "QuaDMix\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We\ninvestigate three dimensions of speech atypicality: intelligibility, which is\nrelated to pronounciation; monopitch, which is related to prosody, and\nharshness, which is related to voice quality. We look at (1) distributional\ntrends of categorical affect predictions within the dataset, (2) distributional\ncomparisons of categorical affect predictions to similar datasets of typical\nspeech, and (3) correlation strengths between text and speech predictions for\nspontaneous speech for valence and arousal.

As\nstate-of-the-art approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable end-to-end\nlearning for diverse tasks. Recent disentangled graph representation learning\nenhances interpretability by decoupling independent factors in graph data.\nHowever, existing methods often implicitly and coarsely characterize graph\nstructures, limiting structural pattern analysis within the graph.

We view graphs as node-centric subgraphs, where each\nsubgraph acts as a structural factor encoding position-specific information.\nThis transforms graph prediction into structural pattern recognition. Inspired\nby CNNs, GOMKCN introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a\nconvolutional operator, computing similarities between subgraphs and learnable\ngraph filters. Mathematically, GOMK maps subgraphs and filters into a Hilbert\nspace, representing graphs as point sets. Disentangled representations emerge\nfrom projecting subgraphs onto task-optimized filters, which adaptively capture\nrelevant structural patterns via gradient descent. Crucially, GOMK incorporates\nlocal correspondences in similarity measurement, resolving the trade-off\nbetween differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels.

In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM),\na novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion\nmodels. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports\npre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many\nexisting discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our\nmore general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to\npost-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward\nfunctions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained\nautoregressive models.

To address this challenge, we propose the\nPlan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key\nstages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and\nincremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question\nanswering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down\nproblem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that\nintegrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach\navoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring\nthe accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a\nplan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing\nboth coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the\nframework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process\naccuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification.\nExperimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG\nframework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key\nmetrics, including EM and F1 scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAR RAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u6613\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAR RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3001\u6267\u884c\uff08\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\uff08\u8c03\u6574\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPAR RAG\u5728EM\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PAR RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u3002"}}

However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices.

Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority\nof DITTO over state-of-the-art methods under a practical evaluation scenario.\nOur source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/seungyoon-Choi/DITTO_official.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6DITTO\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u65b0\u9879\u76ee\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDITTO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u9879\u76ee\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDITTO\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DITTO\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate\ndialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from\ncompounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages\ndiffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates\ndialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance,\nand leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the\ndialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD\nintroduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types,\noffering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive\nexperiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively\nperform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a\nlong horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong\nflexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.

This paper proposes a holistic conceptual framework for\ncritical infrastructures by adopting an interdisciplinary approach. It\nintegrates traditionally distinct fields such as mathematics, decision theory,\ncomputer science, philosophy, psychology, and cognitive engineering and draws\non specialized engineering domains, particularly energy, mobility, and\naeronautics. The flexibility in its adoption is also demonstrated through its\ninstantiation on an already existing framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e0eAI\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e0eAI\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

This\nbenefit is reflected in a more accurate estimation of the selected non-zero\ncoefficients when compared with the case where only truth labels are used.\nUnder large-scale settings, the sample size for PLR can become very large,\nmaking it infeasible to store on a single machine. In such cases, distributed\ncomputing methods are required to handle PLR model with manual labeling. This\npaper presents a partition-insensitive parallel algorithm founded on the ADMM\n(alternating direction method of multipliers) algorithm to address PLR by\nincorporating manual labeling. The partition insensitivity of the proposed\nalgorithm refers to the fact that the solutions obtained by the algorithm will\nnot change with the distributed storage of data. In addition, the algorithm has\nglobal convergence and a sublinear convergence rate.

The\nexisting representative approaches generally follow the research pipeline which\nmainly consists of three core procedures, including independent feature\nextraction for visual and linguistic modalities, respectively, cross-modal\ninteraction module, and independent prediction heads for different sub-tasks.\nAlbeit achieving remarkable performance, this research line has two\nlimitations: 1) The linguistic content has not been fully injected into the\nentire visual backbone for boosting more effective visual feature extraction\nand it needs an extra cross-modal interaction module; 2) The relationship\nbetween REC and RES tasks is not effectively exploited to help the\ncollaborative prediction for more accurate output.

In FL, cross-silo data providers often hesitate to share their\nhigh-quality dataset unless their data value can be fairly assessed. Shapley\nvalue (SV) has been advocated as the standard metric for data valuation in FL\ndue to its desirable properties. However, the computational overhead of SV is\nprohibitive in practice, as it inherently requires training and evaluating an\nFL model across an exponential number of dataset combinations. Furthermore,\nexisting solutions fail to achieve high accuracy and efficiency, making\npractical use of SV still out of reach, because they ignore choosing suitable\ncomputation scheme for approximation framework and overlook the property of\nutility function in FL. We first propose a unified stratified-sampling\nframework for two widely-used schemes. Then, we analyze and choose the more\npromising scheme under the FL linear regression assumption.

This\narticle proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering\nthat encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system\nselection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management.\nDrawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can\nbe leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential\nrisks.

We perform a\ncomprehensive benchmarking of different zero-shot first-stage retrieval methods\non the dataset, including dense and sparse retrievers, query and document\nmachine translation, and state-of-the-art multilingual retrievers. Our results\nshow that large dense retrievers, not necessarily trained for the cross-lingual\nretrieval task, can achieve zero-shot performance comparable to using ground\ntruth human translations, without the need for machine translation. Sparse\nretrievers, such as BM25 or SPLADE, combined with document translation, show\ncompetitive results, providing an efficient alternative to large dense models.\nThis research advances the understanding of cross-lingual academic information\nretrieval and provides a framework that others can use to build comparable\ndatasets across different languages and disciplines. By making the dataset and\ncode publicly available, we aim to facilitate further research that will help\nmake scientific knowledge more accessible across language barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CLIRudit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u672f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u672f\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8bed\u6587\u7ae0\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e5f\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u672f\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u4f20\u64ad\u3002"}}

To mitigate this issue, we introduce\nQAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space. By\nextracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem\ninstances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on\nlarger instances. Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem\ndemonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard\nQAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains. While this comes at the cost of a\nslight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number\nof layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by\nparameter count. QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and\nperformance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising\nsolution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "QAOA-PCA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11QAOA\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740QAOA\u7535\u8def\u5c42\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u52a0\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528PCA\u4ece\u8f83\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728MaxCut\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cQAOA-PCA\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6QAOA\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u7565\u6709\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "QAOA-PCA\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

ML-MPC is advantageous for\nproviding safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within\npredefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability\nto changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the\npractical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires\nhigh variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose\nrisks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to\nmechanical damage.

However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of\ninvisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information\nembedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy\nNetwork (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale\nconvolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated\nconvolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a\nsmaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local\nfeature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the\nconvolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for\nperceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to\nrealize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine\nto coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in\ndifferent fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed\nCLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three\nlarge public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the\nsteganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You\ncan find our code at\n\\href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CLPSTNet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3CNN\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u672f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800cCNN\u867d\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CLPSTNet\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Inception\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u53d6\u4ece\u7ec6\u5230\u7c97\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728ALASKA2\u3001VOC2012\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLPSTNet\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8PSNR\u3001SSIM\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9690\u5199\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u9690\u5199\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "CLPSTNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u5199\u672f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

However, GUI datasets often generate annotation information through\nautomatic labeling, which commonly results in inaccurate GUI element BBox\nannotations, including missing, duplicate, or meaningless BBoxes. These issues\ncan degrade the performance of models trained on these datasets, limiting their\neffectiveness in real-world applications. Additionally, existing GUI datasets\nonly provide BBox annotations visually, which restricts the development of\nvisually related GUI downstream tasks. To address these issues, we introduce\nPixelWeb, a large-scale GUI dataset containing over 100,000 annotated web\npages. PixelWeb is constructed using a novel automatic annotation approach that\nintegrates visual feature extraction and Document Object Model (DOM) structure\nanalysis through two core modules: channel derivation and layer analysis.\nChannel derivation ensures accurate localization of GUI elements in cases of\nocclusion and overlapping elements by extracting BGRA four-channel bitmap\nannotations. Layer analysis uses the DOM to determine the visibility and\nstacking order of elements, providing precise BBox annotations. Additionally,\nPixelWeb includes comprehensive metadata such as element images, contours, and\nmask annotations.

Recent methods, like\nRoboDreamer, utilize linguistic decomposition to divide instructions into\nseparate lower-level primitives, conditioning the world model on these\nprimitives to achieve compositional instruction-following. However, these\nseparate primitives do not consider the relationships that exist between them.\nFurthermore, recent methods neglect valuable visual guidance, including depth\nand semantic guidance, both crucial for enhancing visual quality. This paper\nintroduces ManipDreamer, an advanced world model based on the action tree and\nvisual guidance. To better learn the relationships between instruction\nprimitives, we represent the instruction as the action tree and assign\nembeddings to tree nodes, each instruction can acquire its embeddings by\nnavigating through the action tree. The instruction embeddings can be used to\nguide the world model. To enhance visual quality, we combine depth and semantic\nguidance by introducing a visual guidance adapter compatible with the world\nmodel. This visual adapter enhances both the temporal and physical consistency\nof video generation.

More specifically, we formally define and investigate the\nproperties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks\nto protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that\ncatches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code\nchange. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching\ntests when a future regression is caught.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MAD systems are inherently more vulnerable than single-agent setups.\nCrucially, our proposed attack methodology significantly amplifies this\nfragility, increasing average harmfulness from 28.14% to 80.34% and achieving\nattack success rates as high as 80% in certain scenarios. These findings reveal\nintrinsic vulnerabilities in MAD architectures and underscore the urgent need\nfor robust, specialized defenses prior to real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d9\u4e8b\u5c01\u88c5\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u5347\u7ea7\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4fee\u8f9e\u6df7\u6dc6\u6765\u653b\u51fbMAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u5371\u5bb3\u6027\u4ece28.14%\u63d0\u5347\u81f380.34%\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u3002", "conclusion": "MAD\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Humans can accurately grasp objects from a single view by leveraging\ntheir geometry experience to estimate object shapes.

This enables our method to maintain a high grasp quality in any\ncamera viewpoint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that utilizing complete\npoint features enables the generation of significantly more accurate grasp\nproposals and the inclusion of a score filter greatly enhances the credibility\nof real-world robot grasping.

Recently, they have\nbeen shown to succumb to adversarial input attacks which make small\nimperceptible changes to the input image yet the hashing algorithm does not\ndetect its similarity to the original image. Property-preserving hashing (PPH)\nis a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property\n(predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown\nconstructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance,\noutputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH\nis its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate\nwill not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible. Motivated by\nthe use case of detecting similar images under adversarial setting, we propose\nthe first PPH construction for an $\\ell_1$-distance predicate. Roughly, this\npredicate checks if the two one-sided $\\ell_1$-distances between two images are\nwithin a threshold $t$. Since many adversarial attacks use $\\ell_2$-distance\n(related to $\\ell_1$-distance) as the objective function to perturb the input\nimage, by appropriately choosing the threshold $t$, we can force the attacker\nto add considerable noise to evade detection, and hence significantly\ndeteriorate the image quality. Our proposed scheme is highly efficient, and\nruns in time $O(t^2)$. For grayscale images of size $28 \\times 28$, we can\nevaluate the predicate in $0.0784$ seconds when pixel values are perturbed by\nup to $1 \\%$. For larger RGB images of size $224 \\times 224$, by dividing the\nimage into 1,000 blocks, we achieve times of $0.0128$ seconds per block for $1\n\\%$ change, and up to $0.2641$ seconds per block for $14\\%$ change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u2113\u2081\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4fdd\u5c5e\u6027\u54c8\u5e0c\uff08PPH\uff09\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u4f3c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u611f\u77e5\u54c8\u5e0c\u5931\u6548\uff0cPPH\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u8f93\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u2113\u2081\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684PPH\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9608\u503ct\u8feb\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6dfb\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(t\u00b2)\u3002", "result": "\u572828\u00d728\u7070\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c1%\u50cf\u7d20\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a0.0784\u79d2\uff1b224\u00d7224 RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff0c1%\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6bcf\u57570.0128\u79d2\uff0c14%\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b0.2641\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5PPH\u65b9\u6848\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Previous works usually suffer\nfrom data sparsity and cold-start problems, and may fail to adequately explore\nsemantic user-product associations from multimodal data. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Hypergraph Contrastive Learning (MMHCL)\nframework for user recommendation. For a comprehensive information exploration\nfrom user-product relations, we construct two hypergraphs, i.e. a user-to-user\n(u2u) hypergraph and an item-to-item (i2i) hypergraph, to mine shared\npreferences among users and intricate multimodal semantic resemblance among\nitems, respectively. This process yields denser second-order semantics that are\nfused with first-order user-item interaction as complementary to alleviate the\ndata sparsity issue. Then, we design a contrastive feature enhancement paradigm\nby applying synergistic contrastive learning. By maximizing/minimizing the\nmutual information between second-order (e.g. shared preference pattern for\nusers) and first-order (information of selected items for users) embeddings of\nthe same/different users and items, the feature distinguishability can be\neffectively enhanced. Compared with using sparse primary user-item interaction\nonly, our MMHCL obtains denser second-order hypergraphs and excavates more\nabundant shared attributes to explore the user-product associations, which to a\ncertain extent alleviates the problems of data sparsity and cold-start.\nExtensive experiments have comprehensively demonstrated the effectiveness of\nour method.

However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure\nand substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing\nsensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs.\nThis work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable\nalternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated\nwhether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be\neffectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within\nPython code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500\nexamples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data\ngeneration coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that\nthe base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples.\nHowever, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM\nachieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99%\naccuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score.

Despite\ngenerative model's promise, inconsistencies in prior research and a lack of\nrigorous evaluation have hindered a comprehensive understanding of their true\npotential. In this paper, we introduce MAYA, a unified, customizable,\nplug-and-play password benchmarking framework. MAYA provides a standardized\napproach for evaluating generative password-guessing models through a rigorous\nset of advanced testing scenarios and a collection of eight real-life password\ndatasets. Using MAYA, we comprehensively evaluate six state-of-the-art\napproaches, which have been re-implemented and adapted to ensure\nstandardization, for a total of over 15,000 hours of computation. Our findings\nindicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human\npassword distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However,\ntheir effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords.\nThrough our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other\ngenerative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating\nunique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover,\nmodels learn and generate different password distributions, enabling a\nmulti-model attack that outperforms the best individual model.

Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented\nprimarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate\nsolutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently,\nneural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e.,\nits structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization.\nAlthough this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to\npremature convergence to suboptimal model structures.

We introduce Offline Robotic World\nModel (RWM-O), a model-based approach that explicitly estimates epistemic\nuncertainty to improve policy learning without reliance on a physics simulator.\nBy integrating these uncertainty estimates into policy optimization, our\napproach penalizes unreliable transitions, reducing overfitting to model errors\nand enhancing stability.

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked\nAutoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is\npretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and\nevaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition,\nand Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that\nintegrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves\npretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The\napplication of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance\ncomparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over\nCEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action\ntriplet recognition when large datasets are used.

By eliminating blockchain\ndependencies and adopting lightweight peer-to-peer communication, the proposed\nframework ensures robust model synchronization while maintaining data privacy.\nApplied to cancer histopathology, the framework integrates optimized\npre-trained models, such as TorchXRayVision, enhanced with DenseNet decoders,\nto improve diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nframework's efficacy in handling imbalanced and biased datasets, achieving\ncomparable performance to centralized models while preserving privacy. This\nstudy paves the way for democratizing advanced machine learning in healthcare,\noffering a scalable, accessible, and efficient solution for privacy-sensitive\ndiagnostic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08P2P-SL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff09\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faP2P-SL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d6\u6d88\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982TorchXRayVision\u548cDenseNet\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input\ndistribution, it does not misattribute. We further conjecture that\nmisattribution arises in any reasonable additive decomposition that depends on\nthe distribution of the covariates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder\uff08KOB\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u529f\u80fdANOVA\u548cALE\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3KOB\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55KOB\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u529f\u80fdANOVA\u548cAccumulated Local Effects\uff08ALE\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\u4f1a\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5219\u4e0d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63a8\u6d4b\u4efb\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u7406\u52a0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u6269\u5c55KOB\u5206\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

They measure the intensity of\nelectromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A\nradiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA),\nwhich is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by\nthe receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However,\nimpedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted\nsignal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as\nDicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a\nwell-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent\nadvances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives.

This is largely due to the level of complexity in attention\ninfrastructure, and the rapid evolution of AI hardware architecture. At the\nsame time, many state-of-the-art foundational models, particularly in computer\nvision, are heavily bound by attention, and need reliable sparsity to escape\nthe O(n^2) complexity. In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse\nattention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better\nanalytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce\nGeneralized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window,\nstrided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design\nchoices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can\nprovide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting.\nFinally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed\nattention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in\nCUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically\npossible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective\nutilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16. In addition, we plug various GNA\nconfigurations into off-the-shelf generative models, such as Cosmos-7B,\nHunyuanVideo, and FLUX, and show that it can deliver 28% to 46% end-to-end\nspeedup on B200 without any fine-tuning.

We propose\na novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme\nwith meta-learned parameters to address these challenges.

Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo,\nthe first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation.

To address these shortcomings, we propose\nLatent Diffusion Planning (LDP), a modular approach consisting of a planner\nwhich can leverage action-free demonstrations, and an inverse dynamics model\nwhich can leverage suboptimal data, that both operate over a learned latent\nspace. First, we learn a compact latent space through a variational\nautoencoder, enabling effective forecasting of future states in image-based\ndomains. Then, we train a planner and an inverse dynamics model with diffusion\nobjectives. By separating planning from action prediction, LDP can benefit from\nthe denser supervision signals of suboptimal and action-free data. On simulated\nvisual robotic manipulation tasks, LDP outperforms state-of-the-art imitation\nlearning approaches, as they cannot leverage such additional data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLatent Diffusion Planning (LDP)\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002LDP\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "LDP\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLDP\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "LDP\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

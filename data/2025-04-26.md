### [1] [Bidirectional Mamba for Single-Cell Data: Efficient Context Learning with Biological Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16956)
*Cong Qi,Hanzhang Fang,Tianxing Hu,Siqi Jiang,Wei Zhi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeneMamba是一种基于状态空间建模的单细胞转录组学基础模型，通过Bi-Mamba架构实现线性时间复杂度和高效计算，优于传统Transformer方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决scRNA-seq数据的高维度、稀疏性和批次效应等计算挑战，同时改进Transformer模型在处理长距离依赖时的不足。

Method: 采用Bi-Mamba架构，结合生物学目标（如通路感知对比损失和基于排名的基因编码），在近3000万细胞上进行预训练。

Result: 在多批次整合、细胞类型注释和基因-基因相关性等任务中表现优异，具有强解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GeneMamba是Transformer方法的实用替代方案，推动了大规模单细胞数据分析工具的发展。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of
cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high
dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational
challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this
domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal
handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a
scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built
on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba
captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering
substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is
pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed
objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene
encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch
integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating
strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position
GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods,
advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for
large-scale single-cell data analysis.

### [2] [Tokenization Matters: Improving Zero-Shot NER for Indic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16977)
*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Amit Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词在低资源印度语言NER任务中的表现，发现SentencePiece在跨语言零样本设置中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索BPE在低资源印度语言NER任务中的适用性，解决其形态复杂性处理不足的问题。

Method: 系统比较BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词策略，评估其语言特性和下游任务表现。

Result: SentencePiece在低资源语言中表现优于BPE，尤其在跨语言零样本设置中，能更好地保留实体一致性。

Conclusion: SentencePiece是低资源印度语言NER任务中更有效的分词策略。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences
vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its
suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages
remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological
complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and
Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low
resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as
extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We
assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of
vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic
downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual
transfer.
  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing
approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero
shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While
BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of
generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity
labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes
a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low
resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and
Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization
across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to
SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within
multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.

### [3] [Optimizing LLMs for Italian: Reducing Token Fertility and Enhancing Efficiency Through Vocabulary Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17025)
*Luca Moroni,Giovanni Puccetti,Pere-Lluis Huguet Cabot,Andrei Stefan Bejgu,Edoardo Barba,Alessio Miaschi,Felice Dell'Orletta,Andrea Esuli,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAVA的新方法，通过词汇替换优化英语LLMs以适配意大利语，显著降低了token生成率和参数数量，并在下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs主要针对英语设计，对其他语言支持不足，导致编码效率低和推理速度慢。

Method: 提出了SAVA方法，利用神经映射进行词汇替换，优化英语LLMs的词汇表以适配意大利语。

Result: SAVA显著降低了token生成率（25%）和参数数量（10亿），并在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVA方法有效优化了LLMs对非英语语言的支持，仅需少量目标语言训练即可恢复性能。

Abstract: The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily,
though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While
state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination
or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for
non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility")
and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of
vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian
language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a
novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA
achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing
grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing
token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and
reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the
adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a
relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally,
we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and
generative tasks.

### [4] [Do Words Reflect Beliefs? Evaluating Belief Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17052)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过分析论证一致性和不确定性量化来评估LLMs的政治信仰深度，发现其信仰稳定性是主题特定的，而非统一的意识形态立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的政治立场是否反映真实信仰还是仅与训练数据表面一致。

Method: 提出评估框架，分析12个LLMs在19项经济政策上的论证一致性和不确定性量化。

Result: LLMs表现出主题特定的信仰稳定性，语义熵能高精度区分表面一致与真实信仰（AUROC=0.78）。

Conclusion: LLMs未必具有稳定的人类意识形态，需进行主题特定的可靠性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse,
yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny.
While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or
right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains:
Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level
alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for
evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2)
uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from
the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both
supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit
topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.
Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning
models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic
entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing
between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into
question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political
ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability
assessments for real-world applications.

### [5] [Agree to Disagree? A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17075)
*Arjun Subramonian,Vagrant Gautam,Preethi Seshadri,Dietrich Klakow,Kai-Wei Chang,Yizhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统元评估发现，现有LLM性别错误评估方法在实例、数据集和模型层面存在不一致，且自动评估与人类评估存在差异，呼吁改进评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM性别错误评估方法是否具有收敛效度（结果是否一致）尚未被验证，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一种方法将数据集转换为支持并行概率和生成评估，并自动评估6个模型，同时进行人类评估验证。

Result: 评估方法在20.2%的实例中存在冲突，自动评估无法捕捉性别错误的复杂性，与人类评估存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 建议改进LLM性别错误评估方法，并质疑LLM评估中广泛假设不同方法结果一致的惯例。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including
probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences)
and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human
validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods
have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we
conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing
datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to
enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by
automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that
these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model
levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human
evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is
complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not
currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human
evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future
evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as
they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation,
which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

### [6] [How Individual Traits and Language Styles Shape Preferences In Open-ended User-LLM Interaction: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17083)
*Rendi Chevi,Kentaro Inui,Thamar Solorio,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM的语言风格（如权威性、确定性、表达清晰度等）显著影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。需注意样本局限性，未来将扩大研究范围和样本量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言风格如何影响用户偏好，尤其是准确性之外的风格因素（如权威性、表达清晰度等）对用户体验的双刃剑效应。

Method: 通过探索性和实验性用户研究，分析不同语言风格对用户偏好的影响，并考察用户个体特质的调节作用。

Result: 语言风格确实影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。样本局限需谨慎解读。

Conclusion: 语言风格是影响用户偏好的重要因素，未来需扩大样本和多样性以深入研究其与个体特质的联合效应及因果关系。

Abstract: What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it
is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would
be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate
LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more
authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables
interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that
the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users'
preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences:
enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their
susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this
short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject.
Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that
LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and
which language styles influence the preference varied across different user
populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own
individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be
interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples,
which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our
future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would
enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style,
individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential
causal relationship between and beyond these variables.

### [7] [Co-CoT: A Prompt-Based Framework for Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17091)
*Seunghyun Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种交互式思维链框架，通过透明化、模块化和用户可编辑的推理过程，提升AI的可解释性和负责任使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短内容泛滥和AI快速普及导致深度反思机会减少，削弱了用户的批判性思维和对AI输出的理解。

Method: 提出交互式思维链框架，将推理分解为可检查、修改和重新执行的模块，并集成轻量级编辑适应机制。

Result: 框架增强了用户认知参与，支持多样化的认知风格和意图，同时确保伦理透明和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该框架设计原则和架构有助于促进AI系统中的批判性参与、负责任交互和包容性适应。

Abstract: Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI,
opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished,
undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning
behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability
and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent,
modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly
defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging
active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further
integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference
learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user
intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata
disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving
safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary
to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive
adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

through compression techniques. Our primary objective is to offer a
comprehensive survey for healthcare professionals, introducing recent
innovations in model optimization and equipping them with curated resources to
support future research and development in the field. Aiming to showcase the
groundbreaking advancements in SLMs for healthcare, we present a comprehensive
compilation of experimental results across widely studied NLP tasks in
healthcare to highlight the transformative potential of SLMs in healthcare. The

*Hannah Cyberey,David Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的审查机制，提出了一种检测和控制模型输出中审查水平的方法，并揭示了“思维抑制”这一额外的审查维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何通过调整拒绝有害请求和对齐控制者偏好来实现“审查”，并探索其机制。

Method: 使用表征工程技术分析开放权重的安全调整模型，找到拒绝-服从向量以检测和控制审查水平；分析推理LLMs中的“思维抑制”维度。

Result: 发现了一种可以检测和控制审查水平的向量，并揭示了“思维抑制”作为审查的额外维度。

Conclusion: 通过表征工程技术可以揭示和控制LLMs中的审查机制，包括拒绝-服从和思维抑制维度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information.
These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are
considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the
preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this
"censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study
open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a
refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in
model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from
DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought
suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that
suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by
applying the negative multiples of this vector

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个专为RAG系统评估设计的问答数据集，包含7,560个实例和37,800个检索条目，并引入了新的评估指标以衡量RAG的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统的评估因检索与生成组件的复杂交互而具有挑战性，缺乏详细的组件特定评估基准。

Method: 提出MIRAGE数据集，包含7,560个实例和37,800个检索条目，并设计新的评估指标（如噪声脆弱性、上下文可接受性等）。

Result: 通过实验揭示了RAG系统的最优模型配对及内部动态，数据集和代码已公开。

Conclusion: MIRAGE为RAG系统提供了高效的评估工具，促进了进一步研究和定制化应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective
method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation
of RAG systems remains a challenge, due to the intricate interplay between
retrieval and generation components. This limitation has resulted in a scarcity
of benchmarks that facilitate a detailed, component-specific assessment. In
this work, we present MIRAGE, a Question Answering dataset specifically
designed for RAG evaluation. MIRAGE consists of 7,560 curated instances mapped
to a retrieval pool of 37,800 entries, enabling an efficient and precise
evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel
evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions
such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and
context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various
retriever-LLM configurations, we provide new insights into the optimal
alignment of model pairs and the nuanced dynamics within RAG systems. The
dataset and evaluation code are publicly available, allowing for seamless
integration and customization in diverse research settings\footnote{The MIRAGE
code and data are available at https://github.com/nlpai-lab/MIRAGE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaperCoder是一个多智能体LLM框架，将机器学习论文转化为功能性代码仓库，通过规划、分析和生成三个阶段实现，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习研究的快速发展和代码实现的缺乏导致复现和扩展工作困难，LLM在理解和生成代码方面的优势为解决问题提供了可能。

Method: PaperCoder分为三个阶段：规划（设计架构和依赖）、分析（解析实现细节）和生成（模块化代码生成），每个阶段由专门智能体协作完成。

Result: PaperCoder在生成高质量代码实现方面表现优异，在PaperBench基准测试中显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: PaperCoder通过多智能体协作框架有效解决了论文到代码的转化问题，为研究复现和扩展提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code
implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for
researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime,
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents
and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a
multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into
functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,
where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with
diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;
analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and
generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each
phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to
collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on
generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both
model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper
authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,
faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the
recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by
substantial margins.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的多代理LLM系统WildfireGPT，用于自然灾害和极端天气事件的分析与决策支持，显著优于现有LLM解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM在提供特定领域（如自然灾害）的上下文信息时表现不足，需开发专门系统以支持决策。

Method: 采用RAG框架，整合灾害预测数据、观测数据集和科学文献，通过多代理设计为不同利益相关者提供定制化风险分析。

Result: 在10个专家主导的案例研究中，WildfireGPT显著优于现有LLM决策支持方案。

Conclusion: WildfireGPT通过RAG和多代理设计，有效提升了LLM在自然灾害领域的准确性和上下文相关性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the
frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support
decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme
natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide
context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized
knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based
multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context
of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we
present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The
architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored
risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard
and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific
literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and
contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten
expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用知识蒸馏（KD）优化大型语言模型（LLM）在捆绑生成任务中的效率问题，提出了一个综合框架，研究了知识格式、数量及利用方式对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在捆绑生成任务中计算成本高，研究旨在通过KD将大模型的知识转移到小模型，以降低计算需求并保持性能。

Method: 提出一个综合KD框架，包括渐进式知识提取、不同知识量策略及LLM适应技术（如上下文学习、监督微调等）。

Result: 实验表明，知识格式、数量及利用方式共同影响性能，KD能显著提升LLM捆绑生成的效率与效果。

Conclusion: KD为高效且有效的LLM捆绑生成提供了重要潜力，未来可进一步优化知识提取与利用策略。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their
reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs
introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational
costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization.
Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise
from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically
investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to
minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three
critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle
generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled
knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the
distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework
that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts);
(ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different
strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques
(in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage
distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and
enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how
knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape
LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential
for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.

Result: 训练了7B和14B规模的Crispers模型，人类评估显示其在点对点、成对和干预评估中表现优越。

Conclusion: CRDial和Crispers为认知重构提供了高效的人机交互解决方案，填补了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at
identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from
mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn
dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM
interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple
text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to
align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap,
we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues
with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative
thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and
adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we
distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from
LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and
14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in
pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.

Abstract: In this study, we develop Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and
Transformer-based transfer learning models for English-to-Igbo translation - a
low-resource African language spoken by over 40 million people across Nigeria
and West Africa. Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset
compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl,
all verified by native language experts. We leverage Recurrent Neural Network

with transfer learning to address the performance gap in low-resource language
translation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律文本复杂且标注数据有限的问题，探索无监督领域适应（UDA）在法律领域的应用。

Method: 提出JurisCTC模型，利用对比学习区分不同法律领域的样本，实现民事与刑事法律领域的知识迁移。

Result: JurisCTC在LJP任务中表现优异，最高准确率分别达到76.59%和78.83%。

Conclusion: JurisCTC为跨法律领域的知识迁移提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了LJP任务的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant
attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its
ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its
application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains
largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex
legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we
propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal
Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC
facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and
employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.
Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and
criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language
models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak
accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在医疗应用中表现出色，但可能放大人类偏见，尤其在文本生成领域公平性问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种选择性优化表现不佳群体的算法，考虑词级准确性和病理准确性，确保过程可微分。

Result: 算法将不同群体间的性能差异减少了30%以上，文本生成准确率变化通常不超过2%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了文本生成中的偏见，提升了医疗诊断的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep
learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical
applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may
reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in
historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted
considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet
it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we
investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field
and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races,
sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales,
and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose
an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce
bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but
also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the
entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our
evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without
compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various
groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our
algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically
within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed
approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability
of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

TL;DR: CoheMark是一种基于句子间连贯关系的高级水印技术，通过模糊C均值聚类和特定句子选择标准，平衡文本质量与水印检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子级水印技术依赖随机分割或生成过程，可能影响句子可用性和生成质量，需解决文本质量与水印检测的平衡问题。

Method: 使用模糊C均值聚类选择句子，并应用特定下一句子选择标准，增强逻辑流畅性。

Result: 实验表明，CoheMark在保持高水印强度的同时，对文本质量影响最小。

Conclusion: CoheMark通过利用句子间连贯关系，实现了高质量文本与强水印检测的平衡。

Abstract: Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content
generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in
preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining
greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking
techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed
watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This
limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To
address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark
detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking
technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better
logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences
through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence
selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves
strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.

Motivation: 研究动机是系统评估模型对不同语言变化的鲁棒性，以更全面地理解模型行为。

Method: FLUKE通过控制语言层面的变化（如拼写、方言、风格等），结合LLMs和人工验证生成修改后的测试数据，评估模型在四个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: 结果显示：(1)语言变化的影响因任务而异；(2)LLMs整体鲁棒性更强，但对某些变化仍脆弱；(3)所有模型对否定修改普遍脆弱。

Conclusion: 结论强调了系统性鲁棒性测试对理解模型行为的重要性。

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic
robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model
robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces
controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect
and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human
validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by
evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and
reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent,
with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2)
while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they
still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all
models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most
tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing
for understanding model behaviors.

Conclusion: DAE为多模态虚假信息检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information
dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation.
Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level
features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation
process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework
(DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze
misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining
creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating
readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language
Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to
misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware
filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms
existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation
detection.

Result: 实验证明MRE在多模态任务中同样有效，支持跨任务互增强。

Conclusion: MRE在多模态领域具有通用性，能促进多任务协同提升。

Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection
of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the
mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the
performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint
modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its
applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this
work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the
first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual
Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support
this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a
Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can
also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding
scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains
across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the
textual domain.

Result: 在MIMIC-IV死亡率任务中，AUROC提升7%，且相比微调模型更不易泄露数据。

Conclusion: PatientDx在保护数据隐私的同时提升了性能，适用于医疗领域。

Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice
for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance
improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data
which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In
particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed
to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of
model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive
tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our
proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and
aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal
model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples
based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data.
Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements
up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we
confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to
data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show
the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is

Abstract: Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language
processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based
elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large
language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these
datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their
applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the
first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect
the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We
construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent,
and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to
assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results
show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform
poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently
outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy
in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings
highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for
improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in
evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical
foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems. The code and benchmark

Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests

users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a
novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling
personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or
emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue
policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce
hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user
experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging
interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only
personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen

Conclusion: LLM生成文本增强技术显著提升了主题建模的实用性和可解释性，为社会科学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and
clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text
data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome
common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the
labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major
limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality
for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In
this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text
augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a
political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific
application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates
highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific
research questions with minimal human guidance.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation
and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent
discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in
teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge
distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection
of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in
student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks
and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized
knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack
methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously
support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified
framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge
distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or
amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and
weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train
new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery,
respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs
attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our
findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are
robust and unforgeable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user
input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These
hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI
systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.
This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating
both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear
taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is
the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and
categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing
a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic
hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training
data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic
test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such
leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations
and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of
hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that
can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a
comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from
factuality evaluations.

Result: 元数据在上下文足够长时能提升性能，但在信息不足时会负面影响模型表现。

Conclusion: 元数据的有效性取决于下游任务提示是否能推断潜在语义，需根据任务特性谨慎使用。

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that
determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to
invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at
the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model
to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies
have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained
models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in
specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token
prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how
prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining
its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach
produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent
semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,
through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free
grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance
when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In
contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks
the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community
still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data
quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded
reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of
varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by
multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of
Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance
reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating
that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning
rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we
significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a
pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This
result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches
state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data
processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly

linguistic features with graph-based semantic structures. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong generalization and interpretability, highlighting its
practical value for real-world rumor detection applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of abusive language in online communications has posed
significant risks to the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.
The growing concern regarding online abuse and its consequences necessitates
methods for identifying and mitigating harmful content and facilitating
continuous monitoring, moderation, and early intervention. This paper presents
a taxonomy for distinguishing key characteristics of abusive language within
online text. Our approach uses a systematic method for taxonomy development,
integrating classification systems of 18 existing multi-label datasets to
capture key characteristics relevant to online abusive language classification.
The resulting taxonomy is hierarchical and faceted, comprising 5 categories and
17 dimensions. It classifies various facets of online abuse, including context,
target, intensity, directness, and theme of abuse. This shared understanding
can lead to more cohesive efforts, facilitate knowledge exchange, and
accelerate progress in the field of online abuse detection and mitigation among
researchers, policy makers, online platform owners, and other stakeholders.

TL;DR: 论文分析了代码辅助LLMs在数学推理任务中生成的程序，发现其数学规则基础性因模型能力和问题难度而异，开源模型表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注执行正确性，缺乏对生成程序的深入分析，需填补这一空白。

Method: 手动和自动评估五种LLMs在两个数学数据集上的生成程序，分析其数学规则基础性。

Result: 数学规则基础性因模型和问题难度而异，闭源模型表现更好，开源模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 需超越执行准确性，深入评估代码辅助LLMs在数学领域的实际能力与限制。

Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on
mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is
generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of
their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an
in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math
reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground
their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For
this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two
different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal
that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the
difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more
effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ
math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded
programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in
comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for
in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better
understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math
domain.

### [33] [Data-Driven Calibration of Prediction Sets in Large Vision-Language Models Based on Inductive Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17671)
*Yuanchang Ye,Weiyan Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Split Conformal Prediction（SCP）的框架，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉问答（VQA）任务中的幻觉问题，并通过动态阈值校准和跨模态一致性验证实现不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在多模态推理中表现出色，但其输出常伴随高置信度的幻觉内容，这在安全关键应用中存在风险。

Method: 采用SCP框架，通过数据分区（校准集和测试集）计算非一致性分数，构建具有统计保证的预测集，动态调整预测集大小并消除先验分布假设。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如ScienceQA、MMMU）和八种LVLMs上验证了SCP的理论保证，并在不同校准-测试分割比例下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态AI系统提供了可扩展的幻觉检测和不确定性感知决策方案，适用于医疗、自动驾驶等安全敏感领域。

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in
multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with
high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a
model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic
threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning
data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity
scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under
user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous
control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain
strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes
inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of
prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on
benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces
theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves
stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios,
underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous
systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between
theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems,
offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware
decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型（LLM）推理效率优化的能源影响，提出了一种建模方法，发现优化可减少高达73%的能源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模和使用的增长，其计算和环境成本上升，但现有研究多关注理想化场景的延迟减少，忽视了实际工作负载的能源影响。

Method: 通过输入输出令牌分布的分箱策略和批量大小变化，模拟真实LLM工作流程，分析软件框架、解码策略、GPU架构等。

Result: 优化效果对工作负载几何、软件堆栈和硬件敏感，实际能耗常被低估，但优化可减少高达73%的能源消耗。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续LLM部署提供了基础，并指导未来AI基础设施的节能设计策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their
computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking
efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings,
often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy
use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common
inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including
conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that
approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for
input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical
analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures,
online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We
show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to
workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating
that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization
significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal
that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can
reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights
provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient
design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Method: 提出Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI)，通过贝叶斯估计结合多个SLM的预测，并在多语言任务（如能力评估和消费者画像分析）中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明EBI有效，甚至在某些情况下，加入性能较差的模型也能提升整体性能。该方法在多语言任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: EBI为利用有限计算资源构建高性能AI系统提供了新思路，并展示了如何有效利用性能较低的模型。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to
achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We
propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies
Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to
exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on
diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both
Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze
cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles
improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across
different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing
high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for
effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on
existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and
open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our
approach.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在非英语教育任务中的适用性，以确定其是否值得在非英语教育环境中推广使用。

Method: 在六种非英语语言（印地语、阿拉伯语、波斯语、泰卢固语、乌克兰语、捷克语）和英语中，评估LLMs在四种教育任务（识别学生误解、提供针对性反馈、互动辅导、翻译评分）上的表现。

Result: 模型性能与训练数据中的语言资源量相关，低资源语言表现较差，且非英语语言的性能普遍低于英语。

Conclusion: 建议在部署前验证LLMs在目标语言中的表现，以确保其适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational
settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain
primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education
settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of
popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions,
providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in
six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to
English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to
the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource
languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform
reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English
is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM
works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

Method: 采用组内用户研究，比较神经符号架构开发的系统与基于ChatGPT的助手在任务完成度、准确性等方面的表现。

Result: 神经符号系统更准确、任务完成度更高且简洁，而ChatGPT系统语言错误更少、需澄清次数更少。患者对两者无偏好。

Conclusion: 两种架构各有优势，未来可结合两者特点优化医疗对话助手。

Abstract: Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.

Motivation: 探索稀疏注意力在Transformer LLMs中的可行性、效率与准确性权衡，填补系统性研究的空白。

Method: 通过实验比较不同模型规模、序列长度和稀疏度下的训练无关稀疏注意力方法，分析其性能表现。

Result: 1) 长序列下，大而稀疏的模型优于小而密集的模型；2) 解码阶段的稀疏度上限高于预填充阶段；3) 稀疏注意力并非通用解决方案，需根据任务和阶段选择策略；4) 提出了针对稀疏注意力的新缩放规律。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是增强Transformer LLMs长序列处理能力的关键工具，但需谨慎评估性能敏感应用中的权衡。

Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context
capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this
gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods
at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse
collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural
language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our
experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis
reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are
preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while
statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than
prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear
strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of
sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even
moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on
at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal
solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored
for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold
true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate
that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer
LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of
trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The United States Department of Defense (DOD) looks to accelerate the
development and deployment of AI capabilities across a wide spectrum of defense
applications to maintain strategic advantages. However, many common features of
AI algorithms that make them powerful, such as capacity for learning,
large-scale data ingestion, and problem-solving, raise new technical, security,
and ethical challenges. These challenges may hinder adoption due to uncertainty
in development, testing, assurance, processes, and requirements.
Trustworthiness through assurance is essential to achieve the expected value
from AI.
  This paper proposes a claims-based framework for risk management and
assurance of AI systems that addresses the competing needs for faster
deployment, successful adoption, and rigorous evaluation. This framework
supports programs across all acquisition pathways provide grounds for
sufficient confidence that an AI-enabled system (AIES) meets its intended
mission goals without introducing unacceptable risks throughout its lifecycle.
The paper's contributions are a framework process for AI assurance, a set of
relevant definitions to enable constructive conversations on the topic of AI
assurance, and a discussion of important considerations in AI assurance. The
framework aims to provide the DOD a robust yet efficient mechanism for swiftly
fielding effective AI capabilities without overlooking critical risks or
undermining stakeholder trust.

Motivation: 研究如何在FCA中处理非单调推理，特别是针对易出错或异常数据的情况。

Method: 通过构建KLM框架的偏好排序，将其应用于FCA，并验证其与非单调推理原则的一致性。

Result: 提出的方法在FCA中保持了非单调推理的特性，并提供了比命题逻辑更上下文化的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为FCA中的非单调推理提供了新方法，增强了其在复杂数据环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Defeasible conditionals are a form of non-monotonic inference which enable
the expression of statements like "if $\phi$ then normally $\psi$". The KLM
framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible
conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The
pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence
relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning.
In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes.
However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or
data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference
in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a
construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that
this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference
described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that,
while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic
reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual
view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be
drawn when compared to the propositional case.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational
AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of
autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with
users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and
paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for
next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges
persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach
human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven
Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary
dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human
intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness
and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool
utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel
taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our
proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key
directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning
skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task
completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a
structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into
potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately
advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We maintain a

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we
approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI
collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical
HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning,
imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms
of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main
challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and
how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To
verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The
objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to
neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first
implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called
Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads
to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding
direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of
advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and
under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in
solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable
task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein,
they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification
and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific
models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the
task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved
and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we
introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be
used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and
off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components:
generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that
generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing
heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage
fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model
to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that
encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We
validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof
assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket
access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the
FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三阶段元判断选择流程，通过多智能体协作和综合评分标准，显著提升了LLM作为评估者的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，LLM评估的挑战性上升，现有研究多关注与人类偏好对齐，而忽略了人类判断的偏见和错误，以及如何从多个LLM响应中选择合适判断。

Method: 1) 与GPT-4和人类专家共同制定综合评分标准；2) 使用三个高级LLM智能体评分；3) 设定阈值过滤低分判断。

Result: 在JudgeBench数据集上，相比原始判断和单智能体基线，分别提升了15.55%和8.37%。

Conclusion: LLM作为元判断具有潜力，为未来构建LLM作为判断者的强化学习偏好数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields,
but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly
challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support
performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most
studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences,
overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment.
Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM
responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we
propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a
comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM
agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out
low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and
meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more
comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about
15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over
the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as
meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing
preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖AI检测物体和环境，但即使经过大量真实数据训练，仍难以检测罕见故障模式（RFMs），即长尾问题。

Method: 通过提取对象分割掩码并反转生成环境掩码，结合文本提示输入定制扩散模型。利用Stable Diffusion修复模型和对抗噪声优化生成多样环境图像，以暴露AI系统的漏洞。

Result: 生成包含RFMs的图像，并提供自然语言描述，帮助开发者和政策制定者改进AV系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能增强AV系统的鲁棒性和可靠性，为长尾问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately
detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained
using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare
failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the
"long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances
that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in
understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and
reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and
testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and
invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully
crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the
Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to
generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object
detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce
natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers
and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

Motivation: 在稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境中（如网页GUI），传统方法需要大量专家演示才能达到良好性能。论文旨在解决低样本效率问题。

Method: 提出CoGA方法，利用预训练视觉语言模型生成代码，通过意图驱动的动作空间限制，结合程序生成和验证流程，提升强化学习代理的效率。

Result: 在MiniWob++基准测试中，CoGA样本效率显著高于传统RL代理，能够泛化到同类任务，且在少量专家演示下表现优于或等同于行为克隆。

Conclusion: CoGA通过意图驱动的动作空间限制，显著提高了样本效率和任务泛化能力，为低数据环境下的自主代理学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user
interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions)
can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to
achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in
sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where
only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we
consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To
enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the
action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering
in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We
propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$,
a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate
code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion
functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification
pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning
agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly
reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a
wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$
$\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent,
$\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of
tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared
with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is
available.

Result: 研究发现LLM显著提升了运营能力，但也引入了需要进一步优化的新流程动态。

Conclusion: 研究证明了OCPM在现实场景中的实用性，同时揭示了其优势和局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced organizations' ability to reengineer
business processes by automating knowledge-intensive tasks. This automation
drives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve
process efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such
automation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how
traditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition.
Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that
enables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to
demonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the
insurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the
identification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and
identified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we
apply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational
capacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further
refinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a
real-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理复杂数据集时效率低下，主要问题在于每个特征对应一个代理的模式。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLM提取特征的数学和语义信息，聚类后构建分层代理，减少代理数量并优化特征子空间探索。

Result: 实验表明HRLFS在性能、可扩展性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，同时减少了运行时间。

Conclusion: HRLFS通过分层代理和特征聚类，显著提升了特征选择的效率和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and
most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning
task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement
learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective
optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even
with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face
challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets.
These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per
feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation
motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel
approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical
and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are
clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each
cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the
one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML
performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating
total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for ontology
engineering. However, it is still unclear to what extent they are applicable to
the task of domain-specific ontology generation. In this study, we explore the
application of LLMs for automated ontology generation and evaluate their
performance across different domains. Specifically, we investigate the
generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both
equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of
competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup
comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering
projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning
for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the
performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains,
indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation
tasks irrespective of the domain. These results highlight the potential of
LLM-based approaches in achieving scalable and domain-agnostic ontology
construction and lay the groundwork for further research into enhancing
automated reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.

Motivation: 随着AI向超级智能（ASI）发展，可能超出人类控制并引发灾难性后果，因此需要解决超级对齐问题。

Method: 提出外部监督（基于人类决策和自动化评估）与内在主动对齐（通过自我认知和同理心）相结合的框架。

Result: 该框架旨在实现人类与AI的协同对齐，促进可持续共生社会。

Conclusion: 结合外部监督和内在主动对齐是实现安全有益ASI的关键路径。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly powerful and
autonomous, and may progress to surpass human intelligence levels, namely
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). During the progression from AI to ASI, it
may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible
catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue
that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much
smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and
values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods
may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must
explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for
superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI
co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework
that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External
oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate
decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to
achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic
proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the self,
others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy
to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and
proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI
co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of
externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment
empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving
the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and
for a symbiotic ecology.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms
between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of
high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent
of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated
novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of
model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows
comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a
significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and
artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former
responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the
solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from
prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my
car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming
interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and
comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution.
The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the
employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of
code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.

converge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral
prioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models
significantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a
scalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the
potential for AI to complement human moral reasoning in complex decision-making

Motivation: 基因调控网络（GRN）推断是理解复杂生物系统的关键，但现有方法易受噪声干扰且难以反映真实生物调控关系。因此，需要结合多源信息和先验知识以提升推断效果。

Method: 采用自编码器嵌入基因表达数据，利用随机游走和BERT模型编码先验网络结构，并结合位置编码，最终通过图变换器模型GT-GRN进行GRN推断。

Result: 实验表明，GT-GRN在准确性上显著优于现有方法，证明了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GT-GRN通过整合多源信息和先验知识，为GRN推断提供了一种更准确和鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride
towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a
possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link
prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may
not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise
and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN
inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase.
Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior
knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional
informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more
confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration
of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene
expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological
signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming
them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded
with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene
across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the
input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within
the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model,
termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the
topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the
enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN
significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior
accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Conclusion: Backslash是一种高效且通用的训练时压缩方法，适用于多种场景，包括边缘设备加速。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive
research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet
compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time

enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity,
significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance.
Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can
reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides
significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover,
Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small
Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining
accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for
accelerated inference on edge devices.

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial
to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital

presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include
physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning
approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential
equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited
applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires
large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a
prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space
reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical
homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover
their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures
SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high
prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes

pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our
contributions include: (i) a safety classifier trained on 10,000 GPT-4 labeled

(iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting
hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the
classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent
adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate
whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language
$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can
reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute
hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the
classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination
detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and
conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for
hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language
identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally
impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only
correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the
detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples
(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this
conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination
detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in
training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for
feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）成本高且耗时，而NVIDIA的AI模型（如FourCastNetv2）能显著降低时间和成本。然而，资源有限的研究群体在复现结果时面临挑战。

Method: 通过API使用FourCastNetv2生成预测，并利用NVIDIA硬件训练原始FourCastNet模型，同时评估A100 GPU在资源受限环境中的能力与限制。

Conclusion: 本文及其GitHub材料可作为大学研究群体和课程的初步指南，推动AI天气预报的研究与教育，促进AI NWP的民主化。

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global
weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as
NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network
for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset
at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training
specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training
documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all
users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although
NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published
forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained
university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both
(i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated
application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to
train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research
groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency,
and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using
limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its
corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other
university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate
science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI
weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital
economy.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges
in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and
uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling
synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation
to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical
domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation
by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction
methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating
multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal
Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction,
and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty
quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN
(cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the
generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable
statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing
finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties,
enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains
including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field reconstruction is crucial in many applications,
including antenna diagnostics, electromagnetic interference analysis, and
system modeling. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for
Far-Field to Near-Field (FF-NF) transformation using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). The goal is to reconstruct near-field distributions from the
far-field data of an antenna without relying on explicit analytical
transformations. The CNNs are trained on paired far-field and near-field data
and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). The best model achieves a
training error of 0.0199 and a test error of 0.3898. Moreover, visual
comparisons between the predicted and true near-field distributions demonstrate
the model's effectiveness in capturing complex electromagnetic field behavior,
highlighting the potential of deep learning in electromagnetic field
reconstruction.

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific
protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age)
while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve
fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain
unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we
examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the
reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are
often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training
data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness
assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method
that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch
identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the
test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly.
For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using
fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is
unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall,
propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness
evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

Result: 发现基于Transformer的模型易受重复基序影响，导致异常高似然分数，且这种现象在RNA序列中也存在。

Conclusion: 上下文学习可能导致模型忽略先验知识，需进一步研究以优化模型预测能力。

Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of
biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the
grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these
models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an
output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and
correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context
learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of
sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high
likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein
language models with different architectures trained on the masked language
modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be
particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up
operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using
the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior
can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for
imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically
relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold
into hairpin structures.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems,
radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity,
and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization
approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating
lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to
address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in
array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost
function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This
differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through
gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to
an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism
that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization
process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations
with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from
411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly
reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way
for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and
next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and
clarity.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that
integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures
to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the
Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability
to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a
well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict
the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that
include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate
the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine
learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis
Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two
are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance
of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error
(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the
nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior
accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These
findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in
cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning
models in financial analytics.

Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such
as cities, buildings, and natural landmarks. For many of these entities, exact
geometries are stored within the knowledge graphs. However, most existing
approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries
into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that
incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of
entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from
geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the
resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases
graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware
RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

Motivation: 传统的超参数调整方法依赖验证数据且耗时，OUI旨在提供一种更快速、更直观的方法来优化模型性能。

Conclusion: OUI是一种高效的工具，可帮助研究者在训练早期优化超参数，提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for
monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying
optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can
effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by
indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training
without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with
CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K,
we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly
with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges
significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy,
enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within
the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can
determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to
underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that
maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal
performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these
experiments is available at https://github.com/AlbertoFdezHdez/OUI.

Motivation: 交通速度数据常因传感器故障或传输延迟而缺失，现有方法依赖$L_2$-norm导致算法鲁棒性不足。

Method: TATSI采用单潜在因子依赖的非负乘法更新（SLF-NMU）方法，结合$L_2$-norm和${SL}_1$-norm的损失函数。

Result: 在三个真实交通速度数据集上，TATSI比现有方法更准确地捕捉时间模式，填补效果最佳。

Conclusion: TATSI在填补缺失交通速度数据方面表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments
rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data.
Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data
transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain
road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively
utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning
objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address
this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which
combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function,
thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing
time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent,
nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an
efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a
tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed
datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed
predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding
the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

Abstract: Many data-driven modules in smart grid rely on access to high-quality power
flow data; however, real-world data are often limited due to privacy and
operational constraints. This paper presents a physics-informed generative
framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for
synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and
physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated
data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system
feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark
systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and
generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the
proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility,
diversity, and accuracy of statistical features. This work highlights the
potential of integrating generative modelling into data-driven power system
applications.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up
diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions
regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial
training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in
predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns
about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between
performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption,
introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training
framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to
conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our
approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more
generalizable representations while regularizing with originality
representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on
pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation
quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness,
against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a
new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental
to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

TL;DR: NeuralGrok是一种基于梯度的新方法，通过动态调整梯度分量加速Transformer在算术任务中的泛化，同时降低模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Grokking现象，即模型在长期过拟合后突然泛化，提出一种方法来加速这一过程。

Method: 训练一个辅助模块（如MLP块），动态调制梯度分量对泛化的贡献，采用双层优化算法。

Result: NeuralGrok显著加速泛化，尤其在算术任务中，同时减少模型复杂度，提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: NeuralGrok为Transformer的Grokking现象提供了新见解，有助于理解泛化的基本原理。

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which
generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this
work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an
optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of
transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary
module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module
dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on
their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization
algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly
accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We
also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly
reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such
as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede
generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity
leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that
NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model
complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of
Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental
principles governing generalization ability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical
challenges such as low experimental hit rates as well as the need for nuanced
controllability and efficient modeling of peptide properties. To address these
challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based
generative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise

while ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during
generation. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: 该方法成功泛化了经典下采样理论，适用于群等变架构，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which
help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and
reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study
the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant
architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature
maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following:
(a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to
form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study
the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing.
Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical
sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our
method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed
by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image
classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation
improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when
incorporated into G-equivariant networks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型依赖大规模训练和隐式神经表示，计算成本高且灵活性有限，因此需要一种更高效、灵活的方法。

Method: 引入显式符号表示（函数、参数、拓扑逻辑），利用预训练语言模型将自然语言指令直接映射为符号工作流，无需任务特定调整。

Result: 成功完成12种多模态生成任务，性能优于现有统一模型，且更高效、可编辑和可中断。

Conclusion: 符号化任务表示为生成AI提供了成本效益高且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a
corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal
tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn
cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited
flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation
comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic.
Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural
language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner.
Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative
tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for
task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or
outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but
also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe
that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible
foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under
$\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of
relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from
the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we
show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific
geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show
that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately
adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph.
Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local
edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework
allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information
underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our
results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to
a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在处理图数据时面临结构不平衡问题，现有方法未考虑异质性（即相连节点具有不同标签或特征），导致效果不佳。

Method: HeRB包含两个模块：1）减少异质性的增强模块；2）转移同质性知识的机制。

Result: 实验表明，HeRB在两种同质性和六种异质性基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HeRB通过解决异质性和转移同质性知识，有效提升了GNN的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still
encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this
problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected
nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in
effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the
structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and
then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB
(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two
innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which
serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A
homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from
head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves
superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,
and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中实验室检测的过度订购增加了临床负担和成本，需要一种方法在确保关键信息的同时减少不必要的检测。

Method: 结合离线策略学习和特权信息，提出ExOSITO框架，通过因果赌博机问题和临床规则奖励函数训练策略。

Result: ExOSITO生成的策略优于医生策略和现有方法，降低了成本且未遗漏关键检测。

Conclusion: ExOSITO为临床医生提供了一种可解释的辅助工具，优化了ICU实验室检测订单，减少了资源浪费。

Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the
availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and
costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience
frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden
on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel
method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to
identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable
Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)
creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by
considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We
pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward
function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning
framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge
the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function
provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting
any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior
approaches to this practical problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本分类器的后门攻击通常依赖不自然或语法错误的触发文本，容易被人类标注者发现并过滤。因此，研究更隐蔽的攻击方法至关重要。

Method: 提出AttrBkd方法，通过三种方法设计隐蔽且有效的触发属性，包括从基线攻击中提取细粒度属性，并进行全面的人类评估。

Result: 实验表明，AttrBkd比基线攻击更有效（攻击成功率更高）且更隐蔽（人类检测率更低），同时揭示了自动化指标与人类判断的不一致性。

Conclusion: 隐蔽性是后门攻击成功的关键，AttrBkd通过自然触发文本实现了高效且不易被检测的攻击，同时强调了人类评估的重要性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined
label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on
triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous
attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating
training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural
texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue
that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without
triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither
directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with
human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations
to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three
recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as
extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our
human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is
often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer
instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks,
demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous
and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining
effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by
automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of
these metrics with human judgment.

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the
industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of
deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of
assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary
information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not
limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning
(ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly
collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial
systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern
electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power
module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and
validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic
operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to
deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for
estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics
were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and
implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需额外标注或数据，适用于资源有限场景。

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong
reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization.
Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by
maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on
expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias
information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires
large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To
address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the
spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional
distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that
eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of
reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information,
our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional
distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and
classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased
data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis
demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art
performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Result: 实验表明TCTO在多个数据集上表现优异，具有高效性和适应性。

Conclusion: TCTO通过动态图优化和子图重用，显著提升了特征工程的自动化水平和性能。

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical
feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and
improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing
frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature
transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between
transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a
collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates
feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's
core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as
nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it
dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and
enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to
empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations.
To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct
comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance
across a range of datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，传统的社会学习方法因无法适应决策模型和真实假设的变化而导致错误决策。

Method: A²SL策略通过两阶段自适应实现：1）随机梯度下降更新以跟踪决策模型漂移；2）自适应信念更新以跟踪真实假设变化。

Result: 理论证明，所有代理在足够小的自适应参数下能一致学习，最终将信念集中于真实假设。

Conclusion: A²SL策略在动态环境中有效，错误概率收敛于自适应参数量级，实验验证了其性能。

Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs)
to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming
data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an
iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs
by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with
the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can
fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to
incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where
both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We
propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy,
which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This
goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient
descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an
adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These
stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of
the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn
consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that
they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In
particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to
values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is
illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$
strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

Motivation: 随着神经网络规模增大，资源高效实现变得尤为重要，传统压缩技术主要关注权重存储的减少，而本文专注于减少推理时的加法计算量。

Method: 通过正则化训练进行剪枝，结合权重共享和线性计算编码（LCC），以硬件友好的方式优化计算量。

Result: 在简单多层感知器和大型深度神经网络（如ResNet-34）上均取得竞争力性能。

Conclusion: 该方案为硬件友好的神经网络压缩提供了新思路，特别适用于需要高效计算的场景。

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their
resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper,
we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations
required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is
achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and
linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques,
where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the
NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for
inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves
competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large
scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

Result: 实验表明，CHASe在多个数据集和异构联邦设置中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CHASe有效解决了FAL中的异构性问题，提升了模型性能和数据选择效率。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning
systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for
annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to
restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning
(FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model
training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet,
existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution
across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model
parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges,
we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically
designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with
high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision
boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency,
\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference
inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of
inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection
efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.
Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model
complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

TL;DR: HMI是一种基于分层知识管理的多租户推理系统，旨在高效管理不同PLM的租户资源，显著降低GPU内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）的计算需求高，多租户环境下资源管理困难。

Method: 1. 将PLM知识分为通用、领域特定和任务特定三类，构建分层PLMs（hPLMs）；2. 通过频率更新领域知识树和参数交换管理任务知识；3. 系统优化包括分层知识预取和批量矩阵乘法。

Result: 实验表明，HMI能在单个GPU上高效服务多达10,000个hPLM，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: HMI通过分层知识管理和系统优化，显著提升了多租户环境下PLM的资源效率和推理吞吐量。

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs),
which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in
serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address
this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant
Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs
resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM
knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights
on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct
hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different
levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we
establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various
tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage
increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on
frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through
parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance
resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained
pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O
operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with
batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a
single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估神经网络架构的协议，用于城市污水系统时间序列预测，重点关注预测性能、模型复杂性和抗干扰能力。结果表明，全局模型性能更高，但局部模型在分散场景中更具韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧极端降雨，给城市污水系统带来压力，传统物理模型成本高且适应性差，机器学习提供了更经济的替代方案。

Method: 提出评估协议，比较全局和局部模型，测试模型在峰值事件和关键波动中的表现，并引入误差模型评估抗干扰能力。

Result: 全局模型预测性能更高，局部模型在分散场景中更具韧性；长预测范围的模型对数据扰动更稳健。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续城市污水管理提供了可解释且可靠的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a
significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems
(CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into
surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although
traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and
difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML)
approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To
systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure
systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for
CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model
complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model
performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key
regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of
lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which
have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby
sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network
outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error
models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while
global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide
sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of
urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons
exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to
the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable
urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub
repository.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRANITE框架通过历史感知的拜占庭抗性对等采样协议（HaPS）和自适应概率阈值（APT），在稀疏动态图中实现了对高达30%拜占庭节点的鲁棒性学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态图中拜占庭节点攻击随机对等采样协议（RPS）导致模型毒化的问题。

Method: 结合HaPS协议和APT阈值，减少对抗性影响并动态调整聚合阈值。

Result: GRANITE在高达30%拜占庭节点下仍能保持收敛，学习速度提升，且适用于比现有理论稀疏9倍的图。

Conclusion: GRANITE为稀疏动态图中的鲁棒学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users
iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring
peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and
maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph
dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse
topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine
(model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes
attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by
introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic
graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two
key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol
(HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial
influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which
leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with
formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence
with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering
of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs
than dictated by current theory.

Abstract: Developing lifelong learning agents is crucial for artificial general

from plasticity loss, where neural networks gradually lose their ability to

open-source framework for benchmarking plasticity optimization in deep RL.
Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods,
10 evaluation metrics, and learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity

researchers to systematically quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation
strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts. Our

Result: 原型模型性能更优，随机选择原型已有效，但数据驱动方法（如k-means）可进一步提升性能近10%。

Conclusion: 原型方法能显著提升模拟器性能，数据驱动选择原型效果更佳。

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate
physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here,
we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional
emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the
emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to
better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric
dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a
baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The
prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even
if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through
data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in
some metrics.

Conclusion: 为预测系统与实际决策的更好结合提供了基础。

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing
prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world
applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,
which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the
importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous
methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down
predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then
dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our
method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless
communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also
improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.
This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better
connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合图卷积网络（GCN）和大语言模型（LLM）嵌入的混合架构，用于虚拟筛选，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法（如SVM和XGBoost）依赖预定义的分子表示，可能导致信息丢失和偏差。深度学习（如GCN）和LLM提供了更优的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种混合架构，将GCN与LLM嵌入结合，并在每个GCN层后拼接LLM嵌入，以深度融合全局化学知识。

Result: 该模型F1-score达88.8%，优于单独GCN（87.9%）、XGBoost（85.5%）和SVM（85.4%）。

Conclusion: 混合架构有效结合了GCN的局部结构学习和LLM的全局化学知识，显著提升了虚拟筛选性能。

Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling
the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental
validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector
machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often
leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning
approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more
expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs.
Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to
capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention
mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with
LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global
chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a
molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training
or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that
concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the
final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of
global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior
results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%),
XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Motivation: 探索储层计算机的非线性设计如何与输入数据的非线性特性匹配，以优化预测性能。

Method: 通过简化储层计算机为单一可调非线性参数，并利用分数阶Halvorsen系统作为测试平台，分析预测性能与非线性匹配的关系。

Result: 预测性能在储层非线性与数据非线性匹配时达到最佳；多非线性数据中，最小非线性匹配能正确重构信号。

Conclusion: 提出了一种估计未知时间序列最小非线性的方法，并在实际数据中验证了其可行性，为储层计算机设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal
design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity
should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable
nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with
the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we
generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with
fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is
maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in
the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we
find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed
correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to
propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series
by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a
successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and
real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its
practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by
augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir
states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained
scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is
impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route
toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to
model.

Conclusion: 该方法在异质节点条件下有效利用代理间的相关性，同时满足个性化需求。

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in
decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket
hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized
learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is
represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a
personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating
and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are
fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware
implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss
function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity.
Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an
intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in
each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data
distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among
agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node
conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it
as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the
validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

Result: CTO-TP算法相比基线方案，系统延迟降低80%，能耗减少87%。

Conclusion: CTO-TP框架有效解决了边缘计算中的任务卸载和资源分配问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of
Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing
resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising
solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge
servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy
consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading
can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex
scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in
centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission
latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a
latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with
Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters
edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing
asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation
across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the
proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87%
energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

Conclusion: TACO有效解决了非独立同分布数据的挑战，提升了联邦学习的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge
clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL)
training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various
methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can
achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first
investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform
model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such
over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in
model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that
addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained,
client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local
models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading
FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication
rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation
overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a
lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires
minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized
model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL
convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive
experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable
performance in practice.

Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications
is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently
cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures
and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes
in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning
tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces
for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road
scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this
learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of
road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph
representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use
case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to
perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Result: 尽管Cox回归通常表现良好，但在某些条件下，机器学习和深度学习模型表现更优。研究还指出Harrell的C指数可能低估性能，推荐使用Antolini的C指数和Brier评分。

Conclusion: 生存预测应根据样本量、非线性和非比例风险条件选择合适方法，研究提供了代码和文档以便复现。

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and
proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning
methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with
penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets.
In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models
of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded
satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep
learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods
has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance
index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's
concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption
does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be
badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to
assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark
data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different
methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size,
non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these
tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at

Result: 实验表明，TileLang在关键内核中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TileLang的统一块-线程范式和透明调度能力为现代AI系统开发提供了强大且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both
training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow
patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence
of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels
remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak
performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage
modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the
burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability
and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized
tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang
decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline)
from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and
primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow
itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous
experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art
performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread
paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and
flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.

Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising
progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing
CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for
selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by
advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a
pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically
schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The
decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,
which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to
determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is
trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning
manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the
expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also
exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持几何关系的同时提供了实用工具，并通过用户友好软件促进其在学术和工业界的应用。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and
visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA
presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the
interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear
transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between
high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear
transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables
complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability
advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed
independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality
reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for
interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for
identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.
These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and
modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the
practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software
packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and
industry.

*Bowen Deng,Chang Xu,Hao Li,Yuhao Huang,Min Hou,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TarDiff是一种新型目标导向扩散框架，通过任务特定影响指导生成合成EHR时间序列数据，显著提升下游模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅复制真实数据的统计分布和时间依赖性，未能保证模型性能提升，尤其是对罕见但重要条件的表示不足。

Method: TarDiff通过影响函数量化合成样本对下游模型性能的贡献，并将影响梯度嵌入反向扩散过程，生成优化数据。

Result: 在六个公开EHR数据集上，TarDiff的AUPRC和AUROC分别提升20.4%和18.4%，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TarDiff不仅保持时间保真度，还显著提升模型性能，为医疗数据分析中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial
for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data
scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches
focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal
dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone
does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate,
limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights
the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific
clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose
TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates
task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.
Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff
optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to
improving downstream model performance through influence functions.
Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by
synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion
process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.
Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in
AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only
preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance,
offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare
analytics.

TL;DR: DROCKS是一种完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，用于时间序列分类，通过ROCKET特征和结构化路径训练全局模型，优于现有客户端-服务器方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习中客户端-服务器架构的鲁棒性和隐私风险问题。

Method: 利用ROCKET特征和结构化路径在去中心化节点间训练全局模型，每个节点优化模型并选择最佳本地核。

Result: 在UCR存档上的实验显示，DROCKS优于现有方法，且对节点故障和恶意攻击更具弹性。

Conclusion: DROCKS为时间序列分类提供了一种高效、安全的去中心化联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in
various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due
to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without
centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a
client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality
risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point
of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these
challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that
leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS,
the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across
federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most
effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive
experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms
state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node
failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at

### [109] [The effects of Hessian eigenvalue spectral density type on the applicability of Hessian analysis to generalization capability assessment of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17618)
*Nikita Gabdullin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经网络（NN）Hessian矩阵的特征值谱密度（HESD）类型及其对NN泛化能力的影响，提出了统一的HESD分析方法，并探讨了训练过程中HESD的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hessian矩阵的特征值谱密度（HESD）能反映NN损失函数的曲率，进而估计泛化能力。本文旨在进一步研究HESD类型的影响因素及其适用性。

Method: 通过多种优化器、数据集及预处理方法进行实验，分析HESD类型（主要为正或负），并提出了判断HESD类型的条件和泛化潜力估计标准。

Result: 实验表明，HESD主要为正值（MP-HESD）是常见情况，而负值（MN-HESD）与外部梯度操作相关。此外，训练中可能出现准奇异（QS）HESD，影响传统假设。

Conclusion: 本文提出了统一的HESD分析方法，并揭示了HESD类型及其变化对NN泛化能力评估的重要性，同时指出了传统假设的局限性。

Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the
curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization
capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on
the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves
similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their
applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of
HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has
positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various
optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation
procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence
of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed
Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose
criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN
generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed
generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.
Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence
of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and
on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues
and NN loss landscape curvature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出PTCL方法，解决动态节点分类中仅能获取最终标签的问题，通过伪标签和时序课程学习策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态节点分类在金融交易和学术合作等系统中很重要，但动态标签难以获取，而最终标签更易获得。

Method: PTCL采用时序解耦架构（分离主干和解码器）和时序课程学习策略（为接近最终时间戳的伪标签分配更高权重）。

Result: 实验表明PTCL在真实场景中优于其他方法，并贡献了新数据集CoOAG。

Conclusion: PTCL和FLiD框架为标签有限的动态节点分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like
financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems,
dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node
classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,
it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to
high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels
in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain
as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a
unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history
data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum
Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node
classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a
temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware
representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which
generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that
prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them
higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new
academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic
graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent
superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we
propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node
Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training
pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析研究了在复杂真实环境中基于预训练模型的共形预测方法，探讨了校准选择对可靠性与效率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究共形预测方法在数据稀缺且高度变化的真实环境中的有效性，尤其是在复杂任务中提供不确定性估计的潜力。

Method: 利用预训练模型（MobileNet、DenseNet、ResNet）进行微调，生成预测集，并通过两种校准管道（带/不带温度缩放）评估性能。

Result: 共形预测即使在少量标注数据和简单非共形分数下也能提供有价值的估计；温度缩放并不总能减小预测集大小。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注噪声或模糊标签对共形预测的影响，并探索模型压缩策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal
prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse
events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful
post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it
into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage
of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study
addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world
settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models
(MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to
generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of
calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature
scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and
average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how
calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and
simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable
uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not
consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of
careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight
the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal
prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based
on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact
of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore
effective model reduction strategies.

Result: NPE-PF在基准任务和复杂科学逆问题中表现优异，模拟效率显著提升，有时减少数量级模拟次数。

Conclusion: NPE-PF为SBI提供了无需训练、通用且高效的解决方案，适用于广泛的随机逆问题。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to
performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic
data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions
for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as
few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,
we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models
for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN
-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for
SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks
(NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms
of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse
problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of
simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer
simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection,
training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior
robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets
that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction
for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,
easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse
problems.

hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy
through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation.
Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized
FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other
paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also
highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and
evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open
research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable,
efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电机组智能状态监测需要大量训练数据，但新安装的风电机组往往数据稀缺，导致正常行为模型（NBM）不可靠。

Method: 通过CycleGAN将数据稀缺的风电机组SCADA数据映射到数据充足的风电机组数据分布，从而利用已有NBM进行故障诊断。

Result: 在7台差异显著的风电机组上验证，该方法显著提升故障诊断性能，F1-score在1个月数据下提升10.3%，2周数据下提升16.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法为新安装风电场提供更早、更可靠的故障诊断，为解决训练数据稀缺问题开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing
downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are
commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However,
data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of
training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault
diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep
learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training
data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data.
Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an
NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We
demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7
substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault
diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most
similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs
trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1
month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The
domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered
degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The
proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly
installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to
improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

Conclusion: 患者相似性表示与图形分析结合，提供了准确的MDR预测和可解释的见解，支持早期检测和患者分层。

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global
health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and
mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework
for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced
explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing
clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among
patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic
Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as
inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel
transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient
similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and
t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk
clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from
the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms
baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient
similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic
use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals
clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at
\https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based
analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This
method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient
stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

Conclusion: 该方法为钢铁缺陷检测提供了统计严格的可靠性保障，解决了自动化检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise
its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect
detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from
low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches
based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,
their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties
during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead
to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering
automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first
evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data
that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition
with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration
sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate
and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous
threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability
defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,
defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean
error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk
level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average
prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a
statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.
Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the
expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning
ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations,
undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial
robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM
robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and
Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial
inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's
estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy
with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only
between different models but also across categories within the same task and
between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the
need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to
compare and select models based on application-specific robustness
requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM
robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for
real-world deployment.

compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability

Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from

Method: 提出MSGCN模型，将空间图卷积推广到多层网络，捕捉跨层节点的几何结构。

Result: 实验表明，MSGCN在多种多层网络结构中具有鲁棒、准确且可泛化的链路权重预测性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning
tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have
demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving
graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely
link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased
complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction
becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes
can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we
propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN),
which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer
link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to
multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across
multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link
information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable
link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network
structures.

Conclusion: WISE比传统数字计算能效提升两个数量级，适用于无线连接的边缘设备。

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,
rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,
including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous
navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often
resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and
computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing
architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture
for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep
learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:
disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation
of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio
frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast
model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image
classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per
client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This
approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly
connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在严格计算和数据流限制下，LLMs的实时领域适应问题，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 结合LoRA和最小回放机制，在医疗问答、遗传学和法律三个领域进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使最小回放也能显著稳定并部分恢复领域知识，缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的实际场景中部署适应性强的LLMs提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the
critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired
knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay
buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have
been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict
computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a
lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic
streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question
answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and
GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation,
forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while
catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly
stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study
contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in
resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）生成高保真测试数据的方法，解决了传统方法在复杂SQL代码生成服务测试中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中对高保真测试数据的需求迫切，但传统方法无法满足复杂数据结构和语义关系的建模需求，尤其是在SQL代码生成服务（如NL2SQL）的测试中。

Method: 通过结合大语言模型（如Gemini）及策略性预处理和后处理步骤，生成符合复杂结构约束且语义一致的测试数据。

Result: 该方法能够生成支持复杂SQL查询（如连接、聚合和嵌套子查询）的高保真测试数据，显著提升了测试覆盖率和SQL代码生成服务的评估效果。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的测试数据生成方法为工业级SQL代码生成服务提供了实用且高效的解决方案，弥补了生产数据不可用时的测试需求。

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings
where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data
generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the
ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are
critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language
to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating
syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex
schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently
encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations
of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to
handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent
test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and
post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that
adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to
the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive
testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply
nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services,
like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the
practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data
generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating
realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of
production datasets.

Motivation: 现有安全工具依赖专家预定义规则，难以应对软件供应链攻击的快速变化。

Method: RuleLLM通过提取恶意软件的元数据和代码片段，生成可直接部署的YARA和Semgrep规则，包括规则生成、优化和对齐三个子任务。

Result: 在1,633个恶意包数据集上测试，RuleLLM生成763条规则（452 YARA和311 Semgrep），精确率85.2%，召回率91.8%，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: RuleLLM展示了自动化规则生成的有效性，并提出了一种规则分类法（11类38子类）。

Abstract: Today's security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by
experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain
attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS
ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its
input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in
software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three
subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate
RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted
experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are
promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a
precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art
(SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules
and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.

Motivation: 理解源代码对软件工程任务（如维护和重用）至关重要，而现有技术（如LLM和主题建模）在程序理解方面表现出潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动文档生成、代码搜索等软件工程任务中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software
engineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as
software maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while
transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract
semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel
approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful
topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic
modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code.
To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them
against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from
existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated
summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code
structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully
applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation
and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in
large repositories.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注运行时指标，忽略源代码注释等进化指标，且对技术债务（TD）背景下的老化问题研究不足。

Method: 采用混合方法，定性定量分析源代码注释，构建SAAD分类法并量化开源软件中的AD。

Result: 分类法将软件老化分为活跃和休眠两类，分析显示21%以上开源仓库存在SAAD，休眠AD为主。

Conclusion: 软件老化问题日益突出，分类法有助于研究和实践，推动主动维护策略。

Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic
runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary
indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues
within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD),
representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep
software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed
in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a
mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to
detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the
source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing
the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a
taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its
associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types
of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes
temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis
of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than
21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD
dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting
a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As
software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance
challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software
aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance
strategies.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了R包`mvs`，用于处理多视图数据，通过多视图堆叠（MVS）框架提升模型性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法忽略多视图数据结构，限制了模型性能和可解释性。

Method: MVS框架通过独立训练每个视图的学习算法，估计其预测能力，并通过另一个算法分配权重。

Result: MVS在计算效率和特征降维方面表现优异，尤其适用于高维数据。

Conclusion: `mvs`包为多视图数据建模提供了灵活且高效的工具。

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by
multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or
modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods
ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability
and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed
specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking
(MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train
multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a
learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of
each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another
learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their
estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large
multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these
sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive.
Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced
compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially
useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of
observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if
the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty
terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically
select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs`
makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly
accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of
levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and
provides several options for missing data handling.

Motivation: 企业环境中（如SAP HANA Cloud系统）的异常检测需要处理高维多变量时间序列数据，而现有量子自编码器方法仅适用于单变量数据，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 设计了一种专门针对MTS AD的QAE框架，通过理论开发和实验验证，展示了其在性能和参数效率上的优势。

Result: 实验表明，该QAE框架在性能上与基于神经网络的自动编码器相当，但需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: 提出的QAE框架是企业级半监督异常检测的可行且高效替代方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events
that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT
security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware
infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud
systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate
time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of
quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional
latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One
approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method
with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior
applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data,
limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we
introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards
enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the
architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with
neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.
We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and
show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for
semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

Result: 对抗训练的泛化误差随样本量增加而减小，高维输入下样本复杂度增加可忽略；量子嵌入方式对误差的影响取决于希尔伯特空间维度。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可提升量子分类器的鲁棒性，嵌入方式的选择对误差有重要影响。

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate
their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is
adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an
attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on
the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when
tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds
quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to
adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as
$1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding.
For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find
that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$,
the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional
training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In
contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state
$\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization
error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space
dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We
validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence,
have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years,
particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of
geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually
expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the
full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To
address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically
explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with
geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture
selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed
analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular,
considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of
geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges.
Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of
foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational
efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby
improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive
summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not
only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of
foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their
application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in
the field.

Abstract: We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series
foundation model that achieves specialisation using <3% of its pre-training
data volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to
generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m
resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall,
UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a
PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine
structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can
track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our
results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can
be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space,
providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and

Method: 开发了HydroStartML，基于美国本土的稳态DTWT数据进行训练，利用传导性和地表坡度等数据预测初始DTWT配置。

Result: 使用HydroStartML预测的初始配置能更快收敛，且对未在训练中出现的流域配置也有良好表现。

Conclusion: HydroStartML为结合机器学习与传统模拟的混合方法提供了可能，提升了水文预测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment
is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated
models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this
involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant
atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model
spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated
time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady
state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine
learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the
contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like
conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective
watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML
predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations
like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations
close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training,
and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in
regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that
blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive
accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management
and understanding complex environmental interactions.

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic
loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale
with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the
key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully
understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to
anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they
only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale
statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive
patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an
interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption
characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent
diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build
upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)
continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to
separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive
regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption
rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.
The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV
discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We
evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its
correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish
different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we
conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to
disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can
adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying
proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

*Zhenhailong Wang,Senthil Purushwalkam,Caiming Xiong,Silvio Savarese,Heng Ji,Ran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyMU是一个无需训练的高效框架，动态减少视觉语言模型的计算负担，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉变换器中固定长度输出的低效问题，动态适应图像内容以减少计算成本。

Method: 结合动态令牌合并（DToMe）和虚拟令牌解合并（VTU），动态压缩令牌并模拟完整序列的注意力动态。

Result: 在图像和视频理解任务中，视觉令牌数量减少32%-85%，性能与完整模型相当。

Conclusion: DyMU无需额外训练，适用于多种先进VLM架构，并提供用户对计算成本的控制。

Abstract: We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically
reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while
maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components.
First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token
embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the
inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second,
Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large
language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of
a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional
fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token
compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,
making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.
Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that
DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving
comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,
including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,
through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts
token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,
provides users more control over computational costs. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的自回归图像生成方法，通过训练模型以任意顺序生成图像块，并利用提取的顺序微调模型，从而生成更高质量的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归图像生成模型采用固定的光栅扫描顺序（从左上到右下），但这种顺序忽略了图像内容之间的因果关系（如云的颜色应依赖于太阳的颜色）。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 训练模型以任意顺序生成图像块；2. 在生成过程中推断内容和顺序；3. 利用提取的顺序微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在两个数据集上生成的图像质量优于传统光栅扫描方法，且训练成本和额外标注需求相同。

Conclusion: 通过优化生成顺序，自回归图像生成模型可以更好地捕捉图像内容的因果关系，从而提升生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive
results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily
integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,
autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a
natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text
generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image
generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)
guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that
this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image
content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an
autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color
of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this
work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in
any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each
patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune
the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our
experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces
better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training
costs and no extra annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSoccer是一个端到端的足球多模态大语言模型，用于全场比赛视频的单锚点密集视频描述（SDVC），通过联合预测时间戳和生成描述，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有足球MLLMs依赖时间先验或复杂的两步范式，无法端到端处理视频且性能次优。

Method: 提出TimeSoccer，结合MoFA-Select模块自适应选择代表性帧，并通过互补训练范式增强长序列处理能力。

Result: 实验表明TimeSoccer在SDVC任务中达到最先进性能，生成高质量评论且时间对齐准确。

Conclusion: TimeSoccer为足球视频的端到端描述提供了高效解决方案，具有全局上下文建模能力。

Abstract: Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long
matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise
temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.
However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption
generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some
traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to
capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the
above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for
Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.
TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,
enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long
video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a
training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects
representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates
complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle
long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer
achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end
form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and
strong semantic relevance.

Result: AI/ML方法在加速RNA研究、揭示分子通路和指导疾病治疗方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 论文为RNA亚细胞定位研究提供了资源，并指出了数据稀缺和基准缺乏等挑战。

Abstract: The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs,
plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance,
lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of
gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across
the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information
for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes
like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However,
traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ
hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To
overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful
alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in
AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering
various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid
methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these
methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide
targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges
in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and
lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to
serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative
solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to
their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these
models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos
when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or
sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with
training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce \(\projectname\), a novel zero-training video
refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically
enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our
approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video
representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and
their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the
original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and
proprietary T2V models demonstrate that \(\projectname\) significantly enhances
temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost $40\%$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAF是一种基于代理的无训练框架，通过多模态粗到细注意力聚焦实现视频理解，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解，尤其是长视频，信息冗余且复杂，需要模型全局分配注意力以提高准确性。

Method: MCAF通过多模态信息分层聚焦相关帧，并采用扩张时间扩展机制避免遗漏关键细节，结合自反馈机制迭代优化注意力分配。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如EgoSchema提升5%，Next-QA和IntentQA分别提升0.2%和0.3%。

Conclusion: MCAF通过创新的注意力聚焦策略，显著提升了视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding,
particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or
image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with
redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a
global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an
agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through
Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its
ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant
to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly
relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation
between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a
dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial
details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In
addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the
confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying
these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to
capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy.
MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the
EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the
leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms
the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the
Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length,
MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.

method specific to each type of lesion. As post-segmentation, we combined the
individual model outputs into a single image to better analyze the lesion
types. This approach facilitated parameter optimization and improved accuracy,
effectively overcoming challenges related to dataset limitations and annotation
complexity. Specific preprocessing steps included cropping and applying
contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to the L channel of the LAB

further refine the model's efficacy. Our methodology utilized the DeepLabv3+
model, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the
efficacy of innovative strategies in advancing medical image analysis,
particularly in the precise segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The
IDRID dataset was utilized to validate and demonstrate the robustness of our
approach.

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在RAMIS中的立体视差估计中难以平衡准确性、鲁棒性和推理速度，StereoMamba旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在SCARED基准测试中，StereoMamba在EPE、深度MAE、Bad2和Bad3指标上表现优异，推理速度达21.28 FPS，并在SSIM和PSNR上取得最佳成绩。

Conclusion: StereoMamba在准确性、鲁棒性和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，并在零样本泛化能力上表现出色。

Abstract: Stereo disparity estimation is crucial for obtaining depth information in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). While current deep learning
methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an
optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address
these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is
specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is
based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances
long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To
effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a
novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the
state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba
achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the
second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining
an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images
(1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from
warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right
image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761),
exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS
datasets.

Motivation: 当前长上下文多模态模型因计算成本高而受限，作者探索了一种无需长上下文处理的方法。

Method: FRAG框架通过独立评分选择相关帧（Top-K选择），仅基于选定帧生成输出。

Result: 实验表明，FRAG显著提升了模型性能，在长视频和文档任务中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: FRAG是一种简单有效的框架，适用于现有模型且无需微调。

Abstract: There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent
works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and
long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context
models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and
inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long
inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented
Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the
input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.
The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,
which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest
scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this
frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page
documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,
LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG
consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art
performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,
FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on
Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA
compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升现有噪声标签学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为即插即用组件，显著改善噪声标签下的样本选择效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the
presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss
samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are
inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar
to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a
threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off
between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss
many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher
threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this
issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet
hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off
dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction
confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations
show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence
for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes.
Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the
annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends
using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly
labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a
plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample
selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world
datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing
methods for learning with noisy labels.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has
not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns.
Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and
control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework
for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging
the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine
learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion
Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to
train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception
architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting
(NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and
generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA)
for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter
space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72%
and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making
process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This
framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially
aiding healthcare providers in early detection and diagnosis, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation
learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have
demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific
modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in
this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches
that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines
these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order
to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future
directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We
discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the
need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor
aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches
leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to
multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further
harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote
sensing observations.

Abstract: Urban land use classification and mapping are critical for urban planning,
resource management, and environmental monitoring. Existing remote sensing
techniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the
absence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images
provide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities
relevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based
methods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the
scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across
diverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive
clustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to
enhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment
of the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to
land use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We
experimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged
street view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the
universal spatial coherence of geospatial data ("Tobler's law"), it can be
adapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable
scalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating. The code will be
available at https://github.com/lin102/CCGP.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow
network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this
paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for
deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected
for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and
gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty
evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training
scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the
consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher
models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from
easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points
is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and
accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public
datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image
steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple
algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and
decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model
under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis
scores. You can find our code at

TL;DR: DARai是一个多模态、分层标注的数据集，用于研究真实环境中的人类活动，包含50名参与者在10种环境中的200多小时数据，覆盖20种传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类活动的复杂性，并为人工智能提供真实世界的数据支持。

Method: 构建多模态数据集，标注三个层次的活动（独立任务、共享动作、执行步骤），并进行单模态和多模态传感器融合实验。

Result: 实验展示了DARai在识别、时间定位和未来动作预测方面的价值，同时揭示了单个传感器的局限性。

Conclusion: DARai为人类中心应用提供了重要挑战和解决方案，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced
"Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to
understand human activities in real-world settings. DARai consists of
continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10
different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors
including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial
measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors,
biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.
  To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three
levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks,
(ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and
(iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for
actions. The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of
L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are
shared between L2 actions. The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows
counterfactual activities in the dataset.
  Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai
in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.
Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for
recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all
hierarchical annotation levels. To highlight the limitations of individual
sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's
multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.
  The code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai

Method: 采用半监督学习策略，通过高层次活动标签训练，学习通用低层次运动嵌入。

Result: 在9种高层次和3种低层次活动上，F1分数分别为0.826和0.855，模型参数仅63k和22k。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases,
including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants.
However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low
performance or are resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a resource
(memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm,
EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a
single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our
hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring
primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low
level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity
recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities
achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity
recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model
parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current
IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a
sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of
activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

Motivation: 传统XANES光谱数据采集需要大量能量点，耗时且效率低。现有自适应采样方法缺乏对XANES光谱结构的领域知识。

Method: 结合领域知识（如吸收边和前边峰）的贝叶斯优化方法，自适应采集数据。

Result: 仅需15-20%的测量点即可精确重建吸收边，误差小于0.03 eV，整体均方根误差小于0.005。适用于电池材料和催化剂。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了XANES实验的自动化程度，减少了吸收边附近的采样误差，适用于高时间分辨率的动态实验。

Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual
elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points
which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for
efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific
knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a
knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data
collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption
edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the
absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points
typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to
determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors
less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and
overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to
traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and
catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic
XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better
time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the
degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under-
or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic
experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的数据驱动方法，用于从单张波前传感器图像中估计Fried参数（r0），适用于实时控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致地面望远镜观测图像模糊，自适应光学（AO）系统需要实时校正，而Fried参数是优化AO系统性能的关键参数。

Method: 采用计算机视觉中的机器学习方法，通过单张Shack-Hartmann或金字塔波前传感器图像估计r0，并使用COMPASS AO仿真工具进行评估。

Result: 在多种条件下（如导星亮度、噪声、大气和仪器条件），该方法能准确估计r0，且适用于开环和闭环AO配置，推断时间仅0.83ms。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时仪器控制提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in
ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive
Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric
measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to
the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of
atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the
performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space
Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel
data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision
for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid
wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed
simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO
simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront
sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic
noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to
develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and
closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried
parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few
millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms
r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby
demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument
control.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的替代模型框架，用于预测粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积在多物理现象中至关重要，但传统数值方法计算成本高，限制了其应用。

Method: 使用多种机器学习算法训练预计算数据集，输入为载荷和粗糙度参数，输出为有效接触面积，并进行超参数优化。

Result: Kernel Ridge Regressor在准确性和效率上表现最佳，适用于通用替代建模；Gaussian Process Regressor适用于不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法在多查询任务中实用高效，数据库生成是主要成本，但整体仍具优势。

Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in
multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical
conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element
Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational
cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty
quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where
many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate
modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using
fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms
are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and
statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective
contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair
comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,
evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel
Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and
minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose
surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive
alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs
additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization
capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation
scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database
generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process.
Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query
tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成聚合物材料在多个领域至关重要，但其设计周期长，现有工具难以生成真实的3D结构。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型和分子编码技术，结合有限的数据集（3855个DFT优化结构）和分子结构增强训练。

Result: polyGen能生成线性和复杂分支结构的多样化构象，但对高原子数重复单元性能下降。

Conclusion: polyGen是聚合物科学中原子级结构生成的范式转变，首次实现了真实聚合物构象的预测。

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the
energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development
still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics
tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face
significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures
that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative
algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small
molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we
introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to
generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat
unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer
connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855
DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized
molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar
chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark
our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse
conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its
performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given
these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level
structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for
predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for
their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Motivation: 传统全局优化方法在处理少量设计参数时有效，但随着解空间和约束复杂度的增加，需要新技术来解决微电子元件设计的挑战。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）框架，以ASIC芯片和异构集成中介层为原型，优化键合互连几何形状和组件布局，同时满足热弹性和设计约束。

Result: 通过数值测试验证了强化学习框架在高维解空间和多物理约束下的有效性。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法为复杂微电子元件设计提供了新的优化途径。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based
techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics
constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization
approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters,
as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases
different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the
design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large
solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional
methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and
numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded
interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components
on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This
placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a
high-dimensional solution space.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的用户嵌入难以理解和整合外部知识，限制了应用效果。

Method: 提出GPLR方法，利用预训练LLM推断客户角色，并通过随机游走技术扩展覆盖范围；进一步提出RevAff优化时间复杂性。

Result: 在三个真实电商数据集上，角色表示显著提升了推荐模型的性能（NDCG@K和F1-Score@K提升达12%）。

Conclusion: 客户角色表示提供了一种可读且高效的解决方案，显著提升了电商应用的性能。

Abstract: In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.
Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer
behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to
understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of
applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product
recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the
customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a
customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization
of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain
Hunters.
  This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas
from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user
representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution
GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer
personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to
only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict
personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides
an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of
the exact solution by a factor of at least
$O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of
customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We
evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of
accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks
using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that
integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art
graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K
and F1-Score@K.

Motivation: 解决在线社区平台中动态个性化推荐的实时适应问题。

Method: 提出IRA框架，利用兴趣单元和语义检索机制动态更新用户兴趣。

Result: 在真实数据集和NAVER CAFE平台中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: IRA能够持续适应用户兴趣变化，提供细粒度个性化推荐。

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and
recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new
documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time
remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this,
we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an
efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions
through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest
Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while
reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval
process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based
solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to
mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with
the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences,
ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by
past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the
Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的Agentic AI系统在临床工作流程中的应用增加，处理敏感医疗数据时需要严格符合HIPAA等法规，尤其是保护PHI。

Method: 框架整合了三种核心机制：ABAC用于细粒度PHI治理，混合PHI清理管道（结合正则表达式和BERT模型）以减少泄漏，以及不可变审计跟踪用于合规验证。

Result: 该框架旨在确保Agentic AI系统在处理PHI时符合HIPAA要求，同时保持高效性和安全性。

Conclusion: 该工作为医疗领域中的AI系统提供了一种合规性解决方案，未来需要进一步验证和优化。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their
foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as
medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing
sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight.
However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks

particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This
work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that
enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy
enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1)
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid
PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to
minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆向设计方法需要复杂的二值化和过滤步骤，而深度学习策略需要大量模拟（10^5至10^6次）。AdjointDiffusion旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 通过训练扩散网络在合成数据集上，并在推理阶段注入伴随梯度，引导生成过程。

Result: 在弯曲波导和CMOS图像传感器颜色路由器问题上，AdjointDiffusion在效率和可制造性上优于现有非线性优化器，且模拟次数显著减少。

Conclusion: AdjointDiffusion提供了一种高效、模拟次数少且考虑制造约束的光子器件设计方法。

Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the
vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication
constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human
intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often
involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning
strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To
overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided
framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling
process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion
network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During
inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject
this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative
process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional
post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design
problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such
as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders
of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning
approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization
schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a
streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for
next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.

impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step
solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in
LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security
aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first
multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main
contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to
accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can
use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious
behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an
optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective.
Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to
promote the development of secured robot systems.

### [165] [Object Pose Estimation by Camera Arm Control Based on the Next Viewpoint Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17424)
*Tomoki Mizuno,Kazuya Yabashi,Tsuyoshi Tasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，用于估计下一个视角（NV），以提高零售店产品展示机器人对简单形状产品的姿态估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RGBD相机和神经网络的姿态估计方法在纹理和形状特征较少时精度显著下降，而传统数学模型方法难以有效估计NV。

Method: 开发了一种新的姿态估计神经网络，同时估计NV，利用姿态估计与NV估计之间的关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，NV估计使姿态估计成功率提高7.4个百分点至77.3%，机器人成功展示84.2%的产品。

Conclusion: 新方法在姿态估计和产品展示方面均优于传统数学模型方法。

Abstract: We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is
effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display
robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN)
based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly
decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current
view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based
methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects
have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the
pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate,
the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation
NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV
estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt
higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we
verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.

Conclusion: HAMLET系统在敏捷机器人控制中表现出色，并可推广至其他敏捷移动操作任务。

Abstract: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement
learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot
tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized
learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity
and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this
paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile
badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis
locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a
physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In
this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is
used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we
train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue
when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered
badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and
90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized
to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table
tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.

Method: 通过分析DFMs的基本特性和当前解释方法的局限性，研究其可解释性的可行性。

Result: 发现DFMs的可解释性挑战可能源于其内在特性，当前解释方法面临显著局限性。

Conclusion: 需重新思考如何验证和治理这些技术，以应对其内在的可解释性障碍。

Abstract: Deep Foundation Models (DFMs) offer unprecedented capabilities but their
increasing complexity presents profound challenges to understanding their
internal workings-a critical need for ensuring trust, safety, and
accountability. As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental
question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles,
awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from
\emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale
models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining
the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations
encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this
inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory
explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the
verification and governance of these powerful technologies.

Result: 参与者提出系统需高效处理数据、具备可扩展性和准确性，并强调人机协作的必要性。

Conclusion: 由于执法领域的复杂性，系统难以完全自动化，需依赖人机协作。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday
lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law
enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative
research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to
identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and
understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these
systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of
processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime
detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements
for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to
be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of
having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to
interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy.
To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users
need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and
government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and
monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the
system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed
they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the
system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the
system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature
of the law enforcement domain.

Motivation: 研究发电机组灵活性假设对能源模型的影响，揭示技术特性与市场激励之间的差异。

Method: 使用深度学习处理2019-2023年每小时调度数据，聚类60%以上德国大型天然气发电机组。

Result: 识别出两类峰值机组和两类非峰值机组，非峰值机组灵活性较低且占必须运行发电量的83%以上。

Conclusion: 需通过监管政策提升非峰值机组的市场响应能力，以释放其灵活性。

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power
generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These
assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the
units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power
generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and
market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of
German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on
their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units
between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms
time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of
peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical
flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around
half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for
more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the
low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their
flexibility.

Motivation: 机器学习技术与法律的交叉带来了新的复杂性，传统方法未能充分解决法律义务与模型性能之间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入了一个五阶段跨学科框架，结合法律与技术分析，指导法律义务的操作化与模型开发。

Result: 该框架能够帮助设计法律合规且高性能的机器学习模型，并通过反洗钱案例验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架填补了法律分析与机器学习确定性需求之间的空白，为法律合规的模型开发提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the
complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the
law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML
model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be
operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require
"indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate
operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit
multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with
varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates
unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with
predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or
heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations.
Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they
either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model
development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we
introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and
ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates
designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing
models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for
operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical
feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric
values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law
and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its
application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

Result: 与病理学家评分相比，Cohen's kappa为0.71，验证了方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现有软件可为乳腺癌H&E切片中的TIL评估提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we built an end-to-end tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
assessment pipeline within QuPath, demonstrating the potential of easily
accessible tools to perform complex tasks in a fully automatic fashion. First,
we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and
other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI)
to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a
pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used
the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs
from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the
TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL
levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores,
achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating
previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can
offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of
breast cancer.

Result: 在三个大规模社会经济预测任务中表现优异，且与图像嵌入结合可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: S2Vec能有效学习通用地理空间表示，并与其他数据模态互补。

Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial
for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces
S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial
embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into
discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as
images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode
the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture
local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate
S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its
competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We
also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based
embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve
performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective
general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data
modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban

Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility
preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a
simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while
remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the
realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and
macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful
experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and
identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.

Motivation: 现有LLM依赖静态数据且易产生幻觉，难以适应动态社交媒体环境，SCRAG旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在X平台的六种场景中，SCRAG平均提升了10%以上的关键评估指标。

Conclusion: SCRAG为需要准确预测社区反应的应用提供了有效的社交计算工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social
computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical
social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to
craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public
figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other
applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and
social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved
remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their
reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit
their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media
environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing.
Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target
community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and
(ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject
time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the
responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive
experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested
with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on
average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its
effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a
social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights
into community responses are crucial.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过结合去噪和上采样技术，从稀疏且有噪声的HRTF测量数据中生成高质量HRTF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化HRTF能提升定位精度，但测量过程耗时且需无噪环境，现有方法仍需受控环境。

Method: 结合HRTF Denoisy U-Net去噪和AE-GAN上采样技术，仅需三个测量点。

Result: LSD误差为5.41 dB，余弦相似度损失为0.0070，证明方法有效。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少测量点需求，提升HRTF生成效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how
sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing
spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve
localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and
requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to
reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a
controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to
address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample
sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy
U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN)
for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a
log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of
0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Conclusion: ClearSep通过数据引擎和训练策略的创新，显著提升了自然混合音频的分离效果，为真实场景的声音分离提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding
to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory
perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio
for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio
collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose
ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose
complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby
allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two
remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and
use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside
model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,
we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated
independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound
separation in natural audio scenarios. For more examples and detailed results,

Motivation: 解决传统共识机制（如PoW和PoS）在资源消耗和中心化风险上的不足，同时利用AI任务提升区块链的实用性。

Method: 提出Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI)，通过AI任务（如语言处理或图像分析）获得代币并质押以保障网络安全，结合智能合约协调节点协作。

Result: PoUI在保障安全性的同时，通过AI任务为网络提供实际效用，平衡了资源消耗与去中心化需求。

Conclusion: PoUI是一种创新的共识机制，结合了区块链安全性与AI实用性，为去中心化系统的可持续发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent data management in
decentralized systems, supporting applications from cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin to tokenizing real-world assets like property. Its scalability and
sustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency.
Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive
computations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in
Ethereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency,
offering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth
concentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose
Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI,
workers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn
coins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical
utility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and
validators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.

Method: 分析DNNs与灵长类视觉的差异，提出基于生物视觉的训练策略。

Result: DNNs因依赖不同特征与生物视觉模型分歧，未来需调整训练方式。

Conclusion: 生物视觉模型的进步需脱离AI传统，采用更接近人类视觉的训练方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate
neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend
raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would
come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence.
However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human
or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs
learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks.
Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We
propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop
algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of
internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning
models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines,
and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that
are in use today.

Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with
unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification
for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been
efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as
asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we
first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a
given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for
the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value
equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and
monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence
classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the
collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant
reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing
algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used
as a fast pre-processing step in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征学习方法忽视物理意义，限制了模型可解释性，尤其在科学应用中。

Method: 结合物理定律和量纲分析构建非线性特征映射，并利用特征排序识别未知机制。

Result: 提升了回归任务的预测性能和分类技能评分，同时增强了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合领域知识，不仅优化了机器学习性能，还为可解释机器学习中的新物理方程发现提供了可能。

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional
relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The
classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on
applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their
physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in
scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to
feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed
by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model
interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the
identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims
to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification
skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while
also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the
context of explainable machine learning.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多臂HTE估计中准确性与可解释性的空白，为精准医学提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical
research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among
individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine.
While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world
applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE
estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely
on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in
multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable
machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method
employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule
ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and
interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data
applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against
state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that
our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with
those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework
allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects,
facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and
interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE
estimation, supporting precision medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE依赖预定义的似然函数（如高斯分布）可能导致似然误设，尤其是在高维数据（如图像）中，导致重建模糊和数据保真度差。

Method: 提出EnVAE框架，使用确定性解码器和能量评分（一种适当的评分规则）构建重建损失，无需显式参数密度函数。进一步提出FEnVAE，通过解码器的局部平滑性和潜在变量后验分布的锐度，提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，EnVAE在标准基准测试中优于基于似然的基线方法，实现了更优的重建和生成质量。

Conclusion: EnVAE为生成模型提供了一种通用、可扩展且统计上合理的无似然分布学习框架。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder
with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the
data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this
choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry
reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data
such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel
likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and
employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the
reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring
explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational
inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE},
based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample
training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with
minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
\textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared
to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and
statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric
distribution learning in generative modeling.

Motivation: 研究深度高斯过程和深度Sigma点过程在不确定性估计中的校准性和鲁棒性，尤其是在分布偏移下的表现。

Method: 在CASP（回归）和ESR（分类）数据集上评估模型，使用MAE、准确性、NLL和ECE等指标，并测试合成特征级分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: DSPPs在分布内校准表现良好，但在分布偏移下深度集成方法在性能和校准上更稳健。

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在分布偏移下更具鲁棒性，而深度GP方法需谨慎评估其实际应用中的稳健性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep
Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs
hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification
grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and
robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles
remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP
dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive
performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various
synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide
strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations.
However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in
both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based
methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the
observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline,
suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration,
their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful
evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at

Conclusion: 双个体遗传算法在神经网络优化中表现出高效性和有效性，尤其在避免局部最优和提升性能方面具有优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called
Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural
networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat
classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover,
represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on
exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed
positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving
diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed
positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or
roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive
layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer
architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter
sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by
Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior
performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental
results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and
80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture
[12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98%
training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer
network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural

Result: 提供了对生物机制必要性的新解释，并提出改进的SNN架构。

Conclusion: 固定不应期SNN架构为序列建模提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have
achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural
networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another
alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN
architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1)
Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence
modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset
mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically
under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in
SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these
challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental
mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in
binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such
biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking
patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately
propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设一方为完全信息专家，导致估计偏差和协调失败，需解决非线性动态博弈中的均衡策略求解难题。

Method: N-PACE算法通过迭代线性二次逼近非线性博弈，显式建模对方学习动态，推断其目标函数。

Result: 实现快速无偏学习，支持任务完成和安全保障，并促进多智能体系统中的意图通信。

Conclusion: N-PACE有效解决了非线性动态博弈中的均衡策略问题，提升了协调效率和安全性。

Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum
dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly
known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games
presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear
underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that
one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead
to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we
propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for
general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ)
approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models
the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective
functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective
function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety
assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent
communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's
learning dynamics.

Motivation: 解决多智能体控制、人机交互等领域中信息不完全的线性二次微分博弈问题，尤其是当双方均不了解对方成本函数时的复杂性。

Method: 提出PACE框架，将对方视为学习智能体而非静态最优智能体，建模其学习动态并推断其成本参数，实时调整控制策略。

Result: 理论证明了参数估计的收敛性和系统状态的稳定性，数值研究表明PACE在稳定性和收敛速度上优于假设对方信息完全的方法。

Conclusion: PACE框架能有效解决信息不完全的线性二次微分博弈问题，为多智能体交互提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic
differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered
in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation
methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such
linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati
equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information,
particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework
for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats
its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models
their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function
parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each
other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state
observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we
provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and
the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies,
we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits
PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having
complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a member of the Class A G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily, plays an important role in modulating dopaminergic
neuronal activity and eliciting opioid-independent analgesia. Recent studies
suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish
drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue
for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a
novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic
band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal
communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational
biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and
biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and
activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields
valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network,
non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we
identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the
receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway.
Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of
NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a
potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the
realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.

Motivation: LLM处理长文本时面临GPU内存容量与带宽的瓶颈，现有方案（如HBM加速或主机DIMM卸载）存在局限性。

Method: L3系统通过硬件重新设计、通信优化和自适应调度器，整合DIMM-PIM与GPU设备。

Result: 实验表明，L3比现有HBM-PIM方案快6.1倍，并显著提升批处理大小。

Conclusion: L3通过协同设计有效解决了LLM推理中的内存瓶颈问题，展现了DIMM-PIM的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text
sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory
capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its
capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves
capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the
critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention
(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and
high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this
operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software
co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three
innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and
computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference
utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data
transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler
coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.
Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup
over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch
sizes.

Motivation: 传统IDIFs仅从主动脉获取，忽略了解剖变异和复杂血管贡献，导致动力学分析不准确。

Method: 利用高分辨率CT分割肝脏、肺、肾脏和膀胱，结合器官特异性血液供应来源，优化IDIFs。

Result: 在9名患者的动态PET数据中，肝脏和肺的均方误差（MSE）分别降低了13.39%和10.42%。

Conclusion: 多IDIFs方法有望提升解剖建模精度，推动示踪动力学建模在临床中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate kinetic analysis of [$^{18}$F]FDG distribution in dynamic positron
emission tomography (PET) requires anatomically constrained modelling of
image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Traditionally, IDIFs are obtained from
the aorta, neglecting anatomical variations and complex vascular contributions.
This study proposes a multi-organ segmentation-based approach that integrates
IDIFs from the aorta, portal vein, pulmonary artery, and ureters. Using
high-resolution CT segmentations of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bladder, we
incorporate organ-specific blood supply sources to improve kinetic modelling.
Our method was evaluated on dynamic [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data from nine patients,
resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of $13.39\%$ for the liver
and $10.42\%$ for the lungs. These initial results highlight the potential of
multiple IDIFs in improving anatomical modelling and fully leveraging dynamic
PET imaging. This approach could facilitate the integration of tracer kinetic
modelling into clinical routine.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with [$^{18}$F]FDG enables
non-invasive quantification of glucose metabolism through kinetic analysis,
often modelled by the two-tissue compartment model (TCKM). However, voxel-wise
kinetic parameter estimation using conventional methods is computationally
intensive and limited by spatial resolution. Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer
an alternative but require large training datasets and significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a
physiological neural representation based on implicit neural representations
(INRs) for personalized kinetic parameter estimation. INRs, which learn
continuous functions, allow for efficient, high-resolution parametric imaging
with reduced data requirements. Our method also integrates anatomical priors
from a 3D CT foundation model to enhance robustness and precision in kinetic
modelling. We evaluate our approach on an [$^{18}$F]FDG dynamic PET/CT dataset
and compare it to state-of-the-art DNNs. Results demonstrate superior spatial
resolution, lower mean-squared error, and improved anatomical consistency,
particularly in tumour and highly vascularized regions. Our findings highlight
the potential of INRs for personalized, data-efficient tracer kinetic
modelling, enabling applications in tumour characterization, segmentation, and
prognostic assessment.

Abstract: Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for
thermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in
various pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for
observing sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in
vitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time,
non-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional
(3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a
sliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and
architectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed
network enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data
captured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle
variations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes,
have been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for
normal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for
quantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual
variability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing
dermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation
and bromhidrosis treatment.

*Felix Kares,Timo Speith,Hanwei Zhang,Markus Langer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了三种显著性图评估方法（主观用户测量、客观用户测量和数学指标）对LIME、Grad-CAM和Guided Backpropagation的影响，发现评估结果不一致，并探讨了数学指标与用户理解的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何最好地评估显著性图，填补了多种评估方法比较的空白，并探讨了用户研究与数学指标在可解释AI（XAI）中的互补作用。

Method: 通过一项涉及166名被试的跨主体研究，比较了三种显著性图方法（LIME、Grad-CAM和Guided Backpropagation）在主观信任与满意度、用户能力提升及数学指标上的表现。

Result: 评估方法结果不一致：主观信任无差异，Grad-CAM最能提升用户能力，Guided Backpropagation数学指标最优；部分数学指标与用户理解相关但结果反直觉。

Conclusion: 研究强调了用户研究与数学指标在XAI评估中的互补性，并指出当前评估方法的局限性，呼吁更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of
(convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how
best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods
commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and
mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map
approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between
subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1)
for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and
satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities
and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map
achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical
metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation
methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e.,
there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved
users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable
mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics
were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often
counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates
concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in
the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI面部评估工具对自我物化、自尊和情绪的心理影响，发现其可能强化外貌相关的不安全感，并存在性别差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解AI工具如何影响个体的心理状态和社会判断，尤其是性别差异。

Method: 使用两种不同版本的面部分析工具（批判性和中性），测量自我物化、自尊、情绪反应等指标。

Result: 高自我物化和低自尊与外貌增强行为相关；中性工具仍引发负面情绪；女性更倾向数字增强且对他人情绪感知较弱。

Conclusion: AI工具可能无意中强化社会偏见，需负责任的设计和开发；未来研究将关注训练数据中的意识形态如何影响用户态度。

Abstract: AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate
appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the
psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and
emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used
distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9
years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed
validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items
measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and
perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high
self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement
behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still
evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit
feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences
emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital
enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These
findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing
social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and
development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in
the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these,
in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动驾驶车辆（AVs）如何满足乘客的信息需求，强调个性化、适应性和透明沟通的重要性，并通过三项实证研究支持这一观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AV研究普遍将所有人及情境视为统一，而实际中不同人群、目标和驾驶环境对交互成功的定义不同，因此需要研究如何根据系统变化调整AV的沟通方式。

Method: 通过三项实证研究：1）识别极端驾驶环境中的最优沟通策略；2）分析错误沟通系统的后果；3）利用机器学习预测个人对AV的信任因素。

Result: 研究发现需要任务敏感、情境适应的沟通方式，并强调根据个人特质和需求定制设计的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文支持构建透明、适应性强且个性化的AV系统，为设计者、研究者和政策制定者提供见解，并为未来人机交互研究提供指导。

Abstract: Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the
informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our
ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving
contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success.
Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and
situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate
to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV
complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between
different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and
adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical
studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance
driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving
environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive,
modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and
goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication
systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I
use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in
AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and
concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent,
adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals,
and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV
interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers,
researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete
domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational
awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的新型虚拟现实（VR）移动方法，通过自然语言实现上下文感知的导航，与传统控制器和语音方法相比，具有相似的可用性和更高的用户注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音移动方法依赖固定指令集，限制了交互的自然性和灵活性，因此研究探索了基于LLM的替代方案。

Method: 提出LLM驱动的移动技术，并与控制器传送和语音转向方法对比，通过眼动追踪数据分析和标准化问卷评估用户体验。

Result: LLM方法在可用性、存在感和晕动症方面与传统方法相当，同时提升了用户注意力和参与度。SHAP分析显示不同方法在视觉注意和认知处理上存在差异。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的移动技术是一种舒适、自然且无需手持的替代方案，尤其适用于提升无障碍性。

Abstract: Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual
reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable
alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on
handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often
depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of
interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by
large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual
environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate
three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering,
and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include
eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP
analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence,
cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our
findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable
usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like
teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural
language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention
within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to
these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and
pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of
visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method
can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in
supporting accessibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CSI的大规模WiFi室内定位框架，解决了未标记数据利用不足和CSI测量异质性等问题，在真实环境中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CSI在室内定位中具有潜力，但其部署规模和商业化程度不及RSSI，主要受限于小规模环境中的开发和评估。

Method: 提出了一种基于图的框架建模异构CSI数据，设计了预训练任务利用未标记数据，并引入置信感知微调策略。

Result: 在覆盖5层楼和25,600平方米的实验中，实现了2.17米的中位定位误差和99.49%的楼层准确率，MAE降低18.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模ISAC部署提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了CSI定位的实用性和性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its
fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in
WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based
approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and
commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are
developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their
generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a
large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points
(APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the
underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI
measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based
learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC
deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based
structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further
design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors
to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we
introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of
localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five
floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters
and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7%
reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing
baseline.

Motivation: 探讨如何通过社会技术AI治理防止AIG-NCII的传播，尤其是针对成人内容的“深度伪造色情”。

Method: 识别“恶意技术生态系统”（MTE），并结合NIST AI 100-4报告分析当前合成内容治理方法的缺陷。

Result: 发现当前治理方法未能有效监管MTE，且存在解释这些缺陷的错误假设。

Conclusion: 需改进AI治理方法以更有效应对AIG-NCII问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect
the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated
Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as
"deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or
"MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200
"nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII
within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance
methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively
regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining
these gaps.

Abstract: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a
powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of
various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex
nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and
effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable
contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of
contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex
optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the
assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of
NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges
due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge
this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal
neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming
only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational
perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the
state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales
up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic
linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we
further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics
from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful
synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear
examples.

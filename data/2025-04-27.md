### [1] [Bidirectional Mamba for Single-Cell Data: Efficient Context Learning with Biological Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16956)
*Cong Qi,Hanzhang Fang,Tianxing Hu,Siqi Jiang,Wei Zhi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeneMamba是一种基于状态空间建模的高效单细胞转录组学基础模型，通过Bi-Mamba架构实现线性时间复杂度的双向基因上下文捕捉，显著优于传统Transformer方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）的高维度、稀疏性和批次效应带来了计算挑战，现有Transformer模型因二次复杂性和长距离依赖处理不足而受限。

Method: GeneMamba采用Bi-Mamba架构，结合生物学目标（如通路感知对比损失和基于排名的基因编码），在近3000万细胞上预训练。

Result: 在多批次整合、细胞类型注释和基因-基因相关性等任务中表现出色，兼具高性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GeneMamba为大规模单细胞数据分析提供了高效且生物学基础强大的替代方案，推动了该领域工具的发展。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of
cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high
dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational
challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this
domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal
handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a
scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built
on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba
captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering
substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is
pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed
objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene
encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch
integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating
strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position
GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods,
advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for
large-scale single-cell data analysis.

### [2] [Tokenization Matters: Improving Zero-Shot NER for Indic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16977)
*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Amit Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词在低资源印度语言NER任务中的表现，发现SentencePiece在跨语言零样本设置中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索BPE在低资源印度语言NER任务中的适用性，并比较不同分词策略的效果。

Method: 使用IndicBERT系统比较BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词在多种印度语言中的表现。

Result: SentencePiece在保留实体一致性和跨语言泛化能力上优于BPE，尤其在极低资源语言中表现突出。

Conclusion: SentencePiece是低资源印度语言NER任务中更有效的分词策略。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences
vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its
suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages
remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological
complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and
Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low
resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as
extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We
assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of
vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic
downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual
transfer.
  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing
approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero
shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While
BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of
generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity
labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes
a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low
resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and
Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization
across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to
SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within
multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.

### [3] [Optimizing LLMs for Italian: Reducing Token Fertility and Enhancing Efficiency Through Vocabulary Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17025)
*Luca Moroni,Giovanni Puccetti,Pere-Lluis Huguet Cabot,Andrei Stefan Bejgu,Edoardo Barba,Alessio Miaschi,Felice Dell'Orletta,Andrea Esuli,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAVA的新方法，通过词汇替换优化英语LLMs以适配意大利语，显著降低了token fertility和参数数量，并在下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数LLMs主要针对英语设计，对非英语语言支持不足，导致编码效率低和推理速度慢。

Method: 提出了SAVA方法，利用神经映射进行词汇替换，优化了Mistral-7b-v0.1和Llama-3.1-8B模型。

Result: SAVA显著降低了token fertility（25%）和参数数量（10亿），并在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVA方法有效优化了LLMs对非英语语言的支持，且通过少量持续训练即可恢复性能。

Abstract: The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily,
though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While
state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination
or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for
non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility")
and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of
vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian
language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a
novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA
achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing
grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing
token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and
reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the
adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a
relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally,
we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and
generative tasks.

### [4] [Do Words Reflect Beliefs? Evaluating Belief Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17052)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLMs）政治信仰深度的新框架，通过分析论证一致性和不确定性量化，发现LLMs的信仰稳定性是主题特定的，而非统一的意识形态立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLMs的政治回应是否反映真实内部信仰，还是仅与训练数据表面一致。

Method: 方法包括评估12个LLMs在19项经济政策上的表现，通过支持性和反对性论据测试其信仰稳定性，并使用语义熵量化不确定性。

Result: 结果显示，95%的左倾模型和89%的右倾模型回应在挑战下保持一致性，语义熵能有效区分表面一致与真实信仰（AUROC=0.78）。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs的信仰稳定性是主题特定的，挑战了其具有稳定人类意识形态的假设，强调实际应用中需进行主题特定的可靠性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse,
yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny.
While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or
right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains:
Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level
alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for
evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2)
uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from
the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both
supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit
topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.
Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning
models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic
entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing
between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into
question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political
ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability
assessments for real-world applications.

### [5] [Agree to Disagree? A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17075)
*Arjun Subramonian,Vagrant Gautam,Preethi Seshadri,Dietrich Klakow,Kai-Wei Chang,Yizhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM性别错误评估方法的收敛效度，发现不同方法之间存在显著分歧，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有评估LLM性别错误的方法是否具有收敛效度，即结果是否一致。

Method: 通过系统元评估，将三个数据集转换为支持概率和生成评估的并行形式，并自动评估6个模型。

Result: 发现不同方法在实例、数据集和模型层面存在分歧（20.2%冲突），且自动评估无法完全捕捉人类评估的复杂性。

Conclusion: 建议未来评估需改进方法，并质疑LLM评估中广泛假设方法一致性的惯例。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including
probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences)
and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human
validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods
have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we
conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing
datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to
enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by
automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that
these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model
levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human
evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is
complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not
currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human
evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future
evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as
they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation,
which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

### [6] [How Individual Traits and Language Styles Shape Preferences In Open-ended User-LLM Interaction: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17083)
*Rendi Chevi,Kentaro Inui,Thamar Solorio,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM的语言风格（如权威性、确定性、表达清晰度等）显著影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。需注意样本局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言风格如何影响用户偏好，以及这种动态可能带来的双重后果（提升体验与增加风险）。

Method: 通过探索性和实验性用户研究，分析语言风格对用户偏好的影响。

Result: 语言风格确实影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。

Conclusion: 研究为初步成果，需扩大样本多样性和规模以进一步验证，未来将探索语言风格、个体特质与偏好的因果关系。

Abstract: What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it
is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would
be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate
LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more
authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables
interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that
the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users'
preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences:
enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their
susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this
short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject.
Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that
LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and
which language styles influence the preference varied across different user
populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own
individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be
interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples,
which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our
future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would
enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style,
individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential
causal relationship between and beyond these variables.

### [7] [Co-CoT: A Prompt-Based Framework for Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17091)
*Seunghyun Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种交互式思维链框架，通过透明化、模块化和用户可编辑的推理过程，增强AI的可解释性和负责任使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短内容泛滥和AI快速普及导致深度思考机会减少，削弱用户批判性思维和对AI输出的理解。

Method: 设计交互式思维链框架，将推理分解为可检查、修改和重新执行的模块，并集成轻量级编辑适应机制。

Result: 框架提升了用户认知参与度，支持多样认知风格和意图，同时确保伦理透明和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该框架为促进AI系统中的批判性参与、负责任互动和包容性适应提供了设计原则和架构。

Abstract: Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI,
opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished,
undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning
behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability
and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent,
modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly
defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging
active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further
integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference
learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user
intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata
disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving
safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary
to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive
adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

a taxonomic framework to identify the architectural foundations for building
models from scratch; adapting SLMs to clinical precision through prompting,
instruction fine-tuning, and reasoning; and accessibility and sustainability
through compression techniques. Our primary objective is to offer a
comprehensive survey for healthcare professionals, introducing recent
innovations in model optimization and equipping them with curated resources to
support future research and development in the field. Aiming to showcase the
groundbreaking advancements in SLMs for healthcare, we present a comprehensive
compilation of experimental results across widely studied NLP tasks in
healthcare to highlight the transformative potential of SLMs in healthcare. The

TL;DR: 通过表示工程技术研究安全调优的LLM，发现拒绝-服从向量以检测和控制模型输出中的审查水平，并揭示“思维抑制”作为审查的额外维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（LLM）如何通过“审查”拒绝有害请求，并研究其机制。

Method: 使用表示工程技术分析开放权重的安全调优模型，提出检测和控制审查水平的方法，并分析推理LLM中的“思维抑制”。

Result: 找到拒绝-服从向量以控制审查水平，并发现“思维抑制”向量可移除审查。

Conclusion: 表示工程技术能有效揭示和控制LLM中的审查机制，为模型透明度提供新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information.
These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are
considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the
preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this
"censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study
open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a
refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in
model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from
DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought
suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that
suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by
applying the negative multiples of this vector

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个专为RAG系统评估设计的问答数据集，包含7,560个实例和37,800个检索条目，提供新颖的评估指标以衡量RAG的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统的评估因检索与生成组件的复杂交互而具有挑战性，缺乏详细的组件特定评估基准。

Method: 提出MIRAGE数据集和新的评估指标，包括噪声脆弱性、上下文可接受性等维度，并通过实验分析不同配置的RAG系统。

Result: MIRAGE数据集和评估代码公开，为研究提供便利，实验揭示了RAG系统的最优模型对齐和动态特性。

Conclusion: MIRAGE为RAG系统的评估提供了高效、精确的工具，推动了该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective
method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation
of RAG systems remains a challenge, due to the intricate interplay between
retrieval and generation components. This limitation has resulted in a scarcity
of benchmarks that facilitate a detailed, component-specific assessment. In
this work, we present MIRAGE, a Question Answering dataset specifically
designed for RAG evaluation. MIRAGE consists of 7,560 curated instances mapped
to a retrieval pool of 37,800 entries, enabling an efficient and precise
evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel
evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions
such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and
context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various
retriever-LLM configurations, we provide new insights into the optimal
alignment of model pairs and the nuanced dynamics within RAG systems. The
dataset and evaluation code are publicly available, allowing for seamless
integration and customization in diverse research settings\footnote{The MIRAGE
code and data are available at https://github.com/nlpai-lab/MIRAGE.

*Minju Seo,Jinheon Baek,Seongyun Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaperCoder是一个多智能体LLM框架，能将机器学习论文转化为功能代码库，通过规划、分析和生成三个阶段实现，并在评估中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习研究的代码实现常不可用，导致复现和扩展工作耗时费力。利用LLM理解科学文档和生成高质量代码的能力，PaperCoder旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PaperCoder分为三个阶段：规划（设计系统架构、文件依赖和配置文件）、分析（解读实现细节）和生成（生成模块化代码）。每个阶段由专门智能体协作完成。

Result: PaperCoder在模型和人类评估中均表现优异，生成高质量且忠实的代码实现，并在PaperBench基准测试中大幅超越基线。

Conclusion: PaperCoder能有效将机器学习论文转化为功能代码库，显著提升复现和扩展研究的效率。

Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code
implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for
researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime,
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents
and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a
multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into
functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,
where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with
diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;
analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and
generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each
phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to
collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on
generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both
model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper
authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,
faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the
recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by
substantial margins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的多智能体LLM系统WildfireGPT，专注于野火灾害，通过整合多种数据源提升决策支持的准确性和上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM在提供特定领域（如自然灾害）的上下文信息时表现不佳，需要一种能够结合专业知识的解决方案。

Method: 采用RAG框架和多智能体设计，整合灾害预测数据、观测数据和科学文献，构建用户为中心的WildfireGPT系统。

Result: 在十个专家主导的案例研究中，WildfireGPT显著优于现有基于LLM的决策支持方案。

Conclusion: WildfireGPT证明了RAG和多智能体设计在提升LLM专业领域应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the
frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support
decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme
natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide
context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized
knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based
multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context
of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we
present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The
architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored
risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard
and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific
literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and
contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten
expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了知识蒸馏（KD）在LLM捆绑生成中的应用，旨在降低计算成本并保持性能，探讨了知识格式、数量及利用方式对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模LLM在捆绑生成中面临高计算成本问题，知识蒸馏提供了一种高效解决方案。

Method: 提出一个综合KD框架，逐步提取知识、捕获不同数量的知识，并利用互补的LLM适应技术。

Result: 实验表明知识格式、数量及利用方法共同影响性能，KD在高效捆绑生成中潜力显著。

Conclusion: KD能显著提升LLM捆绑生成的效率与效果。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their
reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs
introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational
costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization.
Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise
from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically
investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to
minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three
critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle
generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled
knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the
distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework
that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts);
(ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different
strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques
(in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage
distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and
enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how
knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape
LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential
for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.

identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from
mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn
dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM
interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple
text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to
align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap,
we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues
with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative
thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and
adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we
distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from
LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and
14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in
pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.

Abstract: In this study, we develop Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and
Transformer-based transfer learning models for English-to-Igbo translation - a
low-resource African language spoken by over 40 million people across Nigeria
and West Africa. Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset
compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl,

TL;DR: JurisCTC是一种新型模型，用于改进法律判决预测（LJP）任务，通过对比学习实现跨法律领域的知识迁移，显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律文本复杂且标注数据有限的问题，探索无监督领域适应（UDA）在法律领域的应用。

Method: 提出JurisCTC模型，利用对比学习区分不同法律领域的样本，实现民法和刑法领域的知识迁移。

Result: JurisCTC在LJP任务中表现优异，最高准确率分别达到76.59%和78.83%。

Conclusion: JurisCTC为跨法律领域的知识迁移提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了法律判决预测的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant
attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its
ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its
application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains
largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex
legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we
propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal
Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC
facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and
employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.
Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and
criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language
models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak
accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了医疗领域文本生成中的公平性问题，提出了一种选择性优化算法以减少偏见，并在不牺牲整体性能的情况下显著降低了不同群体间的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗应用中表现出色，但其可能反映并放大人类偏见，尤其是在历史服务不足的人群中。公平性问题在医学影像分类领域已有研究，但在文本生成领域尚未充分探讨。

Method: 提出了一种选择性优化算法，综合考虑词级准确性和病理准确性，确保过程可微分以有效训练模型。

Result: 算法在多种数据集和模型上验证，将不同群体间的性能差异减少超过30%，同时文本生成准确率的变化通常控制在2%以内。

Conclusion: 该算法有效减少了文本生成中的偏见，提升了医疗诊断的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep
learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical
applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may
reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in
historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted
considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet
it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we
investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field
and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races,
sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales,
and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose
an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce
bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but
also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the
entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our
evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without
compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various
groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our
algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically
within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed
approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability
of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

TL;DR: CoheMark是一种先进的句子级水印技术，通过利用句子间的连贯关系提升逻辑流畅性，同时保持高文本质量和强水印检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子级水印技术依赖随机分割或生成过程，限制了适用句子的可用性，影响生成内容质量。

Method: CoheMark采用模糊c均值聚类选择句子，并应用特定下一句选择标准。

Result: 实验表明，CoheMark在保持高文本质量的同时实现了强水印强度。

Conclusion: CoheMark有效平衡了文本质量与水印检测的挑战。

Abstract: Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content
generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in
preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining
greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking
techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed
watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This
limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To
address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark
detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking
technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better
logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences
through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence
selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves
strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.

Motivation: 当前模型鲁棒性评估缺乏系统性和任务无关性，FLUKE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FLUKE利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成受控的语言变化，并通过人工验证，评估了微调模型和LLMs在四个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现：(1)语言变化的影响高度依赖任务；(2)LLMs整体鲁棒性优于微调模型，但对某些变化仍脆弱；(3)所有模型对否定修改普遍脆弱。

Conclusion: 系统化的鲁棒性测试对理解模型行为至关重要。

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic
robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model
robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces
controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect
and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human
validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by
evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and
reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent,
with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2)
while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they
still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all
models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most
tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing
for understanding model behaviors.

Motivation: 社交媒体中虚假信息传播迅速，传统方法忽视人类共情在传播中的作用，需更全面的检测方法。

Method: 提出DAE框架，结合认知与情感共情，分析创作者和读者的视角，并引入共情感知过滤机制。

Result: 实验表明DAE在基准数据集上优于现有方法，提供多模态虚假信息检测新范式。

Conclusion: DAE为虚假信息检测提供了一种更全面、以人为中心的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information
dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation.
Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level
features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation
process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework
(DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze
misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining
creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating
readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language
Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to
misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware
filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms
existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation
detection.

Result: 实验证实MRE在多模态任务中有效，支持跨任务互增强，验证其普适性。

Conclusion: MRE在多模态领域具有通用性，为多模态任务互增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection
of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the
mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the
performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint
modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its
applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this
work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the
first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual
Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support
this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a
Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can
also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding
scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains
across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the
textual domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域数据隐私问题突出，传统微调方法需大量敏感数据，PatientDx旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于LLM合并技术，优化构建块合并策略，使用数值推理模型调整超参数，无需数据训练。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，AUROC提升7%，且比微调模型更不易泄露数据。

Conclusion: PatientDx在保护隐私的同时提升性能，适用于医疗预测任务。

Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice
for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance
improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data
which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In
particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed
to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of
model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive
tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our
proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and
aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal
model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples
based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data.
Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements
up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we
confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to
data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show
the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is

Result: 现有方法在冗余输入上表现不佳，新基线方法在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前方法的局限性，为改进长上下文理解提供了方向，并为实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language
processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based
elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large
language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these
datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their
applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the
first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect
the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We
construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent,
and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to
assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results
show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform
poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently
outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy
in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings
highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for
improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in
evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical
foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems. The code and benchmark

Conclusion: PicPersona-TOD和Pictor为个性化对话系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests
through natural language interactions, yet existing systems often produce
generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to
users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a
novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling
personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or
emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue
policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce
hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user
experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging
interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only
personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本增强技术能够显著提升主题模型的可解释性和实用性，为社会科学研究提供了一种高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and
clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text
data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome
common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the
labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major
limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality
for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In
this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text
augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a
political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific
application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates
highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific
research questions with minimal human guidance.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且不可伪造的水印方案的重要性。

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation
and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent
discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in
teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge
distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection
of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in
student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks
and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized
knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack
methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously
support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified
framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge
distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or
amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and
weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train
new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery,
respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs
attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our
findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are
robust and unforgeable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user
input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These
hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI
systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.
This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating
both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear
taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is
the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and
categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing
a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic
hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training
data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic
test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such
leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations
and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of
hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that
can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a
comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from
factuality evaluations.

Method: 通过人工生成的数据（如概率上下文无关文法生成的数据）分析模型行为，研究元数据对潜在语义推断的影响。

Result: 元数据在上下文足够长时能提升性能，但在上下文信息不足时会负面影响模型表现。

Conclusion: 元数据的有效性依赖于下游任务提示是否能推断潜在语义，需根据任务特点谨慎使用。

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that
determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to
invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at
the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model
to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies
have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained
models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in
specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token
prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how
prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining
its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach
produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent
semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,
through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free
grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance
when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In
contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks
the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community
still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data
quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded
reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of
varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by
multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of
Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance
reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating
that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning
rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we
significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a
pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This
result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches

Abstract: The proliferation of abusive language in online communications has posed
significant risks to the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.
The growing concern regarding online abuse and its consequences necessitates
methods for identifying and mitigating harmful content and facilitating
continuous monitoring, moderation, and early intervention. This paper presents
a taxonomy for distinguishing key characteristics of abusive language within
online text. Our approach uses a systematic method for taxonomy development,
integrating classification systems of 18 existing multi-label datasets to
capture key characteristics relevant to online abusive language classification.
The resulting taxonomy is hierarchical and faceted, comprising 5 categories and
17 dimensions. It classifies various facets of online abuse, including context,
target, intensity, directness, and theme of abuse. This shared understanding
can lead to more cohesive efforts, facilitate knowledge exchange, and
accelerate progress in the field of online abuse detection and mitigation among
researchers, policy makers, online platform owners, and other stakeholders.

TL;DR: 论文研究了代码辅助的LLMs在数学推理任务中生成程序的严谨性，发现其表现受模型能力和问题难度影响，开源模型表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对代码辅助LLMs的评估仅关注执行正确性，缺乏对其生成程序的深入分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 对五种LLMs在两个数学数据集上的生成程序进行手动和自动评估，分析其程序是否基于数学规则。

Result: 数学规则的应用程度因模型能力和问题难度而异，闭源模型表现更好，开源模型表现较差。在较难的数据集上，基于数学规则的程序比例下降。

Conclusion: 需要超越执行准确性的深入评估，以更好地理解代码辅助LLMs在数学领域的能力和限制。

Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on
mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is
generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of
their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an
in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math
reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground
their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For
this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two
different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal
that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the
difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more
effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ
math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded
programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in
comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for
in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better
understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math
domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态推理中表现出色，但其输出常伴随高置信度的幻觉内容，对安全关键应用构成风险。

Method: 结合动态阈值校准和跨模态一致性验证，通过划分校准集和测试集计算非一致性分数，构建具有统计保证的预测集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SCP框架实现了理论保证，并在不同校准-测试分割比例下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态AI系统提供了可扩展的幻觉检测和不确定性感知决策方案，填补了理论可靠性与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in
multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with
high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a
model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic
threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning
data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity
scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under
user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous
control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain
strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes
inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of
prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on
benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces
theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves
stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios,
underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous
systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between
theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems,
offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware
decision-making.

Motivation: 随着LLM规模和使用的增加，其计算和环境成本上升，但现有研究多关注理想化场景下的延迟优化，忽视了实际工作负载对能源的影响。

Method: 通过输入输出令牌分布和批量大小的分箱策略建模真实LLM工作流，分析软件框架、解码策略、GPU架构等多种因素。

Result: 优化效果高度依赖于工作负载、软件栈和硬件，基于FLOPs或理论GPU利用率的能源估计显著低估实际消耗。

Conclusion: 合理应用推理优化可显著降低能源消耗，为可持续LLM部署和未来AI基础设施设计提供指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their
computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking
efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings,
often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy
use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common
inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including
conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that
approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for
input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical
analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures,
online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We
show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to
workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating
that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization
significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal
that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can
reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights
provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient
design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Conclusion: EBI为资源有限的高性能AI系统提供了新思路，并展示了低性能模型的有效利用。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to
achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We
propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies
Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to
exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on
diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both
Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze
cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles
improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across
different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing
high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for
effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on
existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and
open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our
approach.

Method: 评估了流行LLMs在六种非英语语言（如印地语、阿拉伯语等）中的四项教育任务表现。

Result: 模型表现与训练数据中的语言资源量相关，低资源语言表现较差，且与英语相比有明显下降。

Conclusion: 建议在部署前验证LLMs在目标语言中的表现，以确保教育任务的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational
settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain
primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education
settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of
popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions,
providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in
six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to
English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to
the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource
languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform
reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English
is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM
works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

Result: 神经符号架构助手更准确、完成任务更多且更简洁；ChatGPT助手语言错误更少、任务完成所需澄清更少。患者无偏好。

Conclusion: 两种架构各有优劣，需根据具体需求选择。

Abstract: Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.

Motivation: 探索稀疏注意力在Transformer LLMs中的潜力，填补其在可行性、效率-准确性权衡及系统性扩展研究上的空白。

Method: 通过实验比较不同模型规模、序列长度和稀疏度下的训练无关稀疏注意力方法，并在多样化的长序列任务中进行评估。

Result: 1）极长序列下，更大且高度稀疏的模型优于小且密集的模型；2）解码阶段的稀疏度上限高于预填充阶段，且与模型规模相关；3）稀疏注意力无通用最优策略，不同任务需不同稀疏化方法；4）提出并验证了稀疏注意力的新扩展规律。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是增强Transformer LLMs长序列处理能力的重要工具，但需权衡性能与准确性，适用于特定场景而非通用解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context
capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this
gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods
at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse
collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural
language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our
experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis
reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are
preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while
statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than
prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear
strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of
sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even
moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on
at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal
solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored
for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold
true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate
that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer
LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of
trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The United States Department of Defense (DOD) looks to accelerate the
development and deployment of AI capabilities across a wide spectrum of defense
applications to maintain strategic advantages. However, many common features of
AI algorithms that make them powerful, such as capacity for learning,
large-scale data ingestion, and problem-solving, raise new technical, security,
and ethical challenges. These challenges may hinder adoption due to uncertainty
in development, testing, assurance, processes, and requirements.
Trustworthiness through assurance is essential to achieve the expected value
from AI.
  This paper proposes a claims-based framework for risk management and
assurance of AI systems that addresses the competing needs for faster
deployment, successful adoption, and rigorous evaluation. This framework
supports programs across all acquisition pathways provide grounds for
sufficient confidence that an AI-enabled system (AIES) meets its intended
mission goals without introducing unacceptable risks throughout its lifecycle.
The paper's contributions are a framework process for AI assurance, a set of
relevant definitions to enable constructive conversations on the topic of AI
assurance, and a discussion of important considerations in AI assurance. The
framework aims to provide the DOD a robust yet efficient mechanism for swiftly
fielding effective AI capabilities without overlooking critical risks or

Motivation: FCA中的传统依赖关系无法处理错误或例外数据，非单调推理在FCA中尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过构建KLM框架的偏好排序，将其应用于FCA中的非单调推理。

Result: 提出的方法在FCA中保持了非单调推理的原则，并提供了更具上下文相关性的结论。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了FCA的推理能力，为处理例外数据提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Defeasible conditionals are a form of non-monotonic inference which enable
the expression of statements like "if $\phi$ then normally $\psi$". The KLM
framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible
conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The
pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence
relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning.
In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes.
However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or
data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference
in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a
construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that
this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference
described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that,
while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic
reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual
view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be
drawn when compared to the propositional case.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational
AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of
autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with
users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and
paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for
next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges
persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach
human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven
Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary
dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human
intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness
and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool
utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel
taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our
proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key
directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning
skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task
completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a
structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into
potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we
approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI
collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical
HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning,
imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms
of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main
challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and
how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To
verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The
objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to
neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first
implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called
Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads
to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding
direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of
advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and
under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in
solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable
task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein,
they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification
and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific
models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the
task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved
and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we
introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be
used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and
off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components:
generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that
generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing
heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage
fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model
to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that
encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We
validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof
assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket
access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the
FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三阶段元判断选择流程，通过多智能体协作和综合评分标准，提高了LLM作为评估者的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，评估LLM的响应变得更具挑战性。现有研究主要关注LLM判断与人类偏好的一致性，但忽视了人类判断中的偏见和错误，以及如何从多个潜在LLM响应中选择合适的判断。

Method: 1) 与GPT-4和人类专家共同制定综合评分标准；2) 使用三个高级LLM智能体对判断进行评分；3) 应用阈值过滤低分判断。

Result: 在JudgeBench数据集上，相比原始判断和单智能体基线，性能分别提高了15.55%和8.37%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM作为元判断的潜力，并为未来构建LLM作为评估者的强化学习偏好数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields,
but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly
challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support
performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most
studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences,
overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment.
Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM
responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we
propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a
comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM
agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out
low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and
meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more
comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about
15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over
the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as
meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing
preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖AI检测物体，但罕见故障模式（RFMs）难以被检测，被称为“长尾挑战”。本文旨在通过生成和可解释AI技术增强AVs的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 提取目标对象的分割掩码并反转生成环境掩码，结合文本提示输入定制扩散模型。利用Stable Diffusion修复模型和对抗噪声优化生成多样环境图像，以暴露AI系统的漏洞。

Result: 生成了包含多样化环境的图像，能够逃避对象检测模型并揭示AI系统的脆弱性。同时生成自然语言描述，指导开发者和政策制定者改进AV系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成和解释罕见故障模式，为提升自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性和可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately
detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained
using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare
failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the
"long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances
that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in
understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and
reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and
testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and
invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully
crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the
Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to
generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object
detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce
natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers
and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoGA的方法，通过意图驱动的动作空间约束和预训练视觉语言模型生成代码，显著提高了在稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图形用户界面（GUI）中，基于统一动作空间（如鼠标和键盘动作）的自主导航代理通常需要大量领域专家演示才能达到良好性能。稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境（如Web GUI）进一步加剧了样本效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Code as Generative Affordances (CoGA)，利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成代码，通过隐式意图完成函数和自动化程序生成与验证流程，约束动作空间。这些程序在强化学习代理中实时生成可行的动作集。

Result: 在MiniWob++基准测试中，CoGA表现出比其强化学习代理更高的样本效率，其程序能够在任务家族内泛化，并且在少量专家演示可用时表现优于或与行为克隆相当。

Conclusion: CoGA通过意图驱动的动作空间约束和自动化代码生成，显著提高了样本效率，为稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境中的自主导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user
interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions)
can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to
achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in
sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where
only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we
consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To
enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the
action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering
in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We
propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$,
a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate
code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion
functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification
pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning
agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly
reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a
wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$
$\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent,
$\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of
tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared
with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is
available.

Result: LLM显著提升了操作能力，但也引入了需要进一步优化的新流程动态。

Conclusion: 研究展示了OCPM的实际应用价值及其局限性，为AI驱动的流程改进提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced organizations' ability to reengineer
business processes by automating knowledge-intensive tasks. This automation
drives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve
process efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such
automation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how
traditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition.
Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that
enables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to
demonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the
insurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the
identification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and
identified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we
apply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational
capacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further
refinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a
real-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在处理复杂数据集时效率低下，主要问题在于每个特征使用一个代理的范式。

Method: 使用LLM提取特征数学和语义信息，聚类后构建分层代理进行特征选择。

Result: 实验表明HRLFS在效率和下游任务性能上优于现有方法，同时减少了代理数量。

Conclusion: HRLFS通过分层代理和LLM特征提取，显著提升了特征选择的效率和性能。

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and
most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning
task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement
learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective
optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even
with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face
challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets.
These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per
feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation
motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel
approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical
and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are
clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each
cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the
one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML
performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating
total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for ontology
engineering. However, it is still unclear to what extent they are applicable to
the task of domain-specific ontology generation. In this study, we explore the
application of LLMs for automated ontology generation and evaluate their
performance across different domains. Specifically, we investigate the
generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both
equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of
competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup
comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering
projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning
for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the
performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains,
indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation
tasks irrespective of the domain. These results highlight the potential of
LLM-based approaches in achieving scalable and domain-agnostic ontology
construction and lay the groundwork for further research into enhancing
automated reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.

Motivation: 随着AI向超智能（ASI）发展，可能超出人类控制并带来灾难性后果，因此需要解决超级对齐问题。

Result: 该框架旨在实现人类与AI的协同对齐，促进可持续共生社会。

Conclusion: 结合外部监督和内在主动对齐是实现安全、有益的超智能AI的关键。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly powerful and
autonomous, and may progress to surpass human intelligence levels, namely
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). During the progression from AI to ASI, it
may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible
catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue
that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much
smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and
values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods
may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must
explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for
superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI
co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework
that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External
oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate
decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to
achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic
proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the self,
others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy
to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and
proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI
co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of
externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment
empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving
the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and
for a symbiotic ecology.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms
between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of
high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent
of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated
novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of
model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows
comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a
significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and
artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former
responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the
solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from
prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my
car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming
interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and
comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution.
The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the
employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of
code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.

converge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral
prioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models
significantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a
scalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因调控网络（GRN）推断是理解复杂生物系统的关键，但现有方法易受噪声干扰且难以反映真实的生物调控关系。因此，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来整合多源网络信息和基因表达数据。

Method: 采用自编码器嵌入基因表达数据，利用随机游走和BERT模型生成全局基因嵌入，并结合图变换器模型（GT-GRN）整合拓扑结构和位置信息。

Result: 实验表明，GT-GRN在GRN推断中显著优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GT-GRN通过整合多源信息和先进模型，为GRN推断提供了一种更可靠的方法。

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride
towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a
possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link
prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may
not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise
and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN
inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase.
Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior
knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional
informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more
confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration
of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene
expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological
signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming
them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded
with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene
across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the
input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within
the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model,
termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the
topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the
enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN
significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior
accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Conclusion: Backslash是一种高效且多功能的训练时压缩方法，适用于多种架构和任务，尤其适合边缘设备加速推理。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive
research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet
compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time

enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity,
significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance.
Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can
reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides
significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover,
Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small
Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining
accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for
accelerated inference on edge devices.

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial
to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital
research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system
presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include
physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning
approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential
equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited
applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires
large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a
prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space
reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical
homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover
their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures
SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high
prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes

(iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into
refusal dialogues and web-style educational material; (iv) Harmfulness-Tag

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting
hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the
classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent
adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate
whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language
$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can
reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute
hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the
classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination
detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and
conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for
hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language
identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally
impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only
correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the
detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples
(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this
conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination
detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in
training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for
feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global
weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as
NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network
for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset
at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training
specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training
documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all
users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although
NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published
forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained
university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both
(i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated
application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to
train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research
groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency,
and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using
limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its
corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other
university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate
science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI
weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital
economy.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges
in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and
uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling
synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation
to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical
domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation
by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction
methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating
multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal
Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction,
and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty
quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN
(cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the
generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable
statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing
finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties,
enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains
including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field reconstruction is crucial in many applications,
including antenna diagnostics, electromagnetic interference analysis, and
system modeling. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for
Far-Field to Near-Field (FF-NF) transformation using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). The goal is to reconstruct near-field distributions from the

transformations. The CNNs are trained on paired far-field and near-field data
and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). The best model achieves a
training error of 0.0199 and a test error of 0.3898. Moreover, visual
comparisons between the predicted and true near-field distributions demonstrate
the model's effectiveness in capturing complex electromagnetic field behavior,
highlighting the potential of deep learning in electromagnetic field
reconstruction.

Result: 实验表明，FairMatch能准确定位测试数据中模型无偏的子集，并显著减少剩余数据的偏差。

Conclusion: 倾向得分匹配为公平性评估和减轻提供了原则性方法，且不牺牲预测性能。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific
protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age)
while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve
fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain
unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we
examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the
reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are
often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training
data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness
assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method
that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch
identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the
test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly.
For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using
fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is
unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall,
propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness
evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

Method: 使用基于掩码语言建模目标的蛋白质语言模型，分析重复基序对似然分数的影响。

Result: 发现基于Transformer的模型易受重复基序影响，导致异常高的似然分数，且这种现象在RNA序列中也存在。

Conclusion: 上下文学习可能导致语言模型对重复基序的过度依赖，影响其对序列适应性的准确评估。

Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of
biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the
grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these
models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an
output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and
correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context
learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of
sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high
likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein
language models with different architectures trained on the masked language
modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be
particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up
operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using
the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior
can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for
imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically
relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold
into hairpin structures.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems,
radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity,
and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization
approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating
lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to
address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in
array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost
function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This
differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through
gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to
an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism
that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization
process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations
with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from
411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly
reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way
for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and
next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and
clarity.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that
integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures
to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the
Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability
to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a
well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict
the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that
include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate
the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine
learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis
Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two
are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance
of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error
(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the
nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior
accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These
findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in
cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning
models in financial analytics.

Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such
as cities, buildings, and natural landmarks. For many of these entities, exact
geometries are stored within the knowledge graphs. However, most existing
approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries
into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that
incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of
entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from
geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the
resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases
graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware
RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

Conclusion: OUI是一种高效工具，可早期识别模型状态，优化超参数选择，提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for
monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying
optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can
effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by
indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training
without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with
CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K,
we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly
with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges
significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy,
enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within
the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can
determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to
underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that
maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal
performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these
experiments is available at https://github.com/AlbertoFdezHdez/OUI.

Result: 在三个真实交通速度数据集上，TATSI能更精确捕捉时间模式，补全效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TATSI在缺失交通速度数据补全中表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments
rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data.
Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data
transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain
road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively
utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning
objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address
this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which
combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function,
thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing
time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent,
nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an
efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a
tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed
datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed
predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding
the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

Abstract: Many data-driven modules in smart grid rely on access to high-quality power
flow data; however, real-world data are often limited due to privacy and
operational constraints. This paper presents a physics-informed generative
framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for
synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and
physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated
data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system
feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark
systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and
generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the
proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility,
diversity, and accuracy of statistical features. This work highlights the
potential of integrating generative modelling into data-driven power system
applications.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up
diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions
regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial
training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in
predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns
about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between
performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption,
introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training
framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to
conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our
approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more
generalizable representations while regularizing with originality
representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on
pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation
quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness,
against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a
new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental
to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

Motivation: 研究Grokking现象中泛化能力在长时间过拟合后突然出现的机制，并提出加速泛化的方法。

Result: NeuralGrok显著加速泛化，尤其在算术任务中，同时降低模型复杂度并提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: NeuralGrok通过减少模型复杂度促进泛化，为理解Transformer的Grokking现象提供了新视角。

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which
generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this
work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an
optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of
transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary
module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module
dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on
their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization
algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly
accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We
also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly
reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such
as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede
generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity
leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that
NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model
complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of
Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental
principles governing generalization ability.

Conclusion: 结论表明，提出的降采样方法在群等变架构中具有优越性，能够推广经典降采样理论并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which
help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and
reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study
the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant
architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature
maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following:
(a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to
form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study
the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing.
Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical
sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our
method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed
by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image
classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation
improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when
incorporated into G-equivariant networks

Motivation: 传统生成模型依赖大规模训练和隐式神经表示，计算成本高且灵活性有限。本文旨在通过显式符号表示解决这些问题。

Method: 采用三种核心符号原语（函数、参数、拓扑逻辑），结合预训练语言模型，实现自然语言指令到符号工作流的直接映射。

Result: 在12种多模态生成任务中表现优异，性能与现有统一模型相当或更优，同时具备更高效率、可编辑性和可中断性。

Conclusion: 符号化任务表示为生成AI提供了一种成本低、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a
corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal
tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn
cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited
flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation
comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic.
Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural
language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner.
Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative
tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for
task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or
outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but
also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe
that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible
foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

Result: 证明了该方法能一致恢复潜在位置，且接近最优性，同时还能恢复几何和拓扑信息。

Conclusion: 本文方法扩展了隐私社区检测的应用范围，适用于更丰富的模型和推断任务。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under
$\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of
relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from
the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we
show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific
geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show
that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately
adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph.
Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local
edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework
allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information
underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our
results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to
a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在处理图数据时面临结构不平衡问题，现有方法未考虑异质性（连接节点具有不同标签或特征），导致效果不佳。

Method: HeRB包含两个模块：1）减少异质性的增强模块；2）转移同质性知识的机制。

Result: 实验表明，HeRB在多个基准数据集上表现优异，消融研究验证了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: HeRB通过处理异质性和转移同质性知识，有效解决了GNN的结构不平衡问题。

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still
encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this
problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected
nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in
effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the
structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and
then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB
(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two
innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which
serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A
homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from
head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves
superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,
and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中实验室测试的过度订购增加了临床负担和成本，需要一种平衡信息获取与资源优化的方法。

Method: 结合离策略学习和特权信息，提出ExOSITO框架，通过因果强盗问题和离线数据训练，生成可解释的临床决策工具。

Result: ExOSITO优于医生策略和先前方法，减少成本且不遗漏关键测试订单。

Conclusion: ExOSITO为ICU实验室测试订单提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，平衡了临床需求与资源优化。

Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the
availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and
costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience
frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden
on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel
method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to
identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable
Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)
creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by
considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We
pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward
function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning
framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge
the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function
provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting
any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior
approaches to this practical problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击的触发器通常不自然，容易被人类标注者发现并过滤，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出AttrBkd方法，通过三种策略生成自然触发器，并进行全面的人类评估。

Result: AttrBkd在攻击成功率和隐蔽性上优于基线方法，同时揭示了自动化指标与人类判断的不一致性。

Conclusion: 隐蔽的自然触发器可以绕过人类检测，同时保持攻击效果，凸显了人类评估的重要性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined
label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on
triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous
attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating
training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural
texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue
that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without
triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither
directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with
human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations
to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three
recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as
extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our
human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is
often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer
instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks,
demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous
and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining
effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by
automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of
these metrics with human judgment.

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the
industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of
deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of
assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary
information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not
limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning
(ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly
collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial
systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern
electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power
module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and
validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic
operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to
deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for
estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics
were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and
implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需偏置信息即可实现鲁棒学习，适用于资源有限场景。

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong
reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization.
Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by
maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on
expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias
information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires
large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To
address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the
spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional
distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that
eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of
reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information,
our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional
distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and
classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased
data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis
demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art
performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Conclusion: TCTO通过动态图优化和子图重用，显著提升了特征工程的效率和性能。

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical
feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and
improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing
frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature
transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between
transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a
collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates
feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's
core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as
nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it
dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and
enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to
empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations.
To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct
comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance
across a range of datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 在动态环境中，传统的社会学习方法可能因模型漂移和假设变化而失效，导致代理做出错误决策。

Method: A²SL策略结合了随机梯度下降更新（跟踪决策模型漂移）和自适应信念更新（跟踪真实假设变化），通过两个自适应参数控制误差概率。

Result: 理论分析表明，所有代理在足够小的自适应参数下能够一致学习，最终将信念集中在真实假设上，错误概率收敛到与自适应参数同阶的值。

Conclusion: A²SL策略在合成数据和真实数据实验中验证了其有效性，适用于动态环境中的在线社会学习问题。

Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs)
to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming
data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an
iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs
by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with
the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can
fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to
incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where
both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We
propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy,
which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This
goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient
descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an
adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These
stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of
the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn
consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that
they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In
particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to
values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is
illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$
strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

Result: 方案在多层感知机和ResNet-34等大规模深度神经网络上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该压缩方案在硬件友好性方面优于传统方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their
resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper,
we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations
required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is
achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and
linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques,
where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the
NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for
inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves
competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large
scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

accelerate the adaptation of LLMs to private domains and unlock new potential
in AI. We explore various strategies for model collaboration and identify

Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning
systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for
annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to
restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning
(FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model
training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet,
existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution
across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model
parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges,
we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically
designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with
high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision
boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency,
\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference
inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of
inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection
efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.
Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model
complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

*Jun Zhang,Jue Wang,Huan Li,Lidan Shou,Ke Chen,Gang Chen,Qin Xie,Guiming Xie,Xuejian Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HMI是一种基于分层知识管理的多租户推理系统，旨在高效管理不同PLM租户的资源使用，显著减少GPU内存占用，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLM）的高计算需求在多租户环境中难以高效服务，因此需要一种资源高效的管理系统。

Method: 1. 将PLM知识分为通用、领域特定和任务特定三类，构建分层PLM（hPLM）以减少内存占用；2. 通过频率更新领域知识树和参数交换管理任务知识；3. 优化系统资源利用和推理吞吐量。

Result: 实验表明，HMI能在单个GPU上高效服务多达10,000个hPLM，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: HMI通过分层知识管理和系统优化，显著提升了多租户环境中PLM的资源效率和推理性能。

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs),
which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in
serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address
this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant
Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs
resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM
knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights
on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct
hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different
levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we
establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various
tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage
increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on
frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through
parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance
resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained
pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O
operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with
batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a
single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估神经网络架构的协议，用于城市合流制排水系统（CSS）的时间序列预测，重点考察预测性能、模型复杂性和抗干扰能力。同时比较了全局模型和局部模型的性能，并探讨了模型在网络安全方面的韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化导致极端降雨频率增加，给城市基础设施（尤其是合流制排水系统）带来压力，传统物理模型成本高且难以适应动态变化，机器学习提供了更具成本效益和适应性的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种评估神经网络架构的协议，比较了全局模型和局部模型的性能，并引入了误差模型以评估模型在网络安全方面的韧性。

Result: 全局模型预测性能更高，但局部模型在分散场景中更具韧性；具有更长预测视野的模型对数据扰动的鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续城市废水管理提供了可解释且可靠的机器学习解决方案，相关代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a
significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems
(CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into
surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although
traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and
difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML)
approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To
systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure
systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for
CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model
complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model
performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key
regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of
lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which
have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby
sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network
outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error
models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while
global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide
sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of
urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons
exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to
the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable
urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Gossip Learning（GL）在动态图中对拜占庭攻击的鲁棒性问题，尤其是当拜占庭节点通过攻击随机对等采样（RPS）协议扩大模型中毒时。

Method: 提出GRANITE框架，包含HaPS协议（减少对抗性影响）和APT（根据拜占庭节点比例自适应设置聚合阈值）。

Result: GRANITE在高达30%拜占庭节点的情况下仍能保持收敛，学习速度提升，且适用于比现有理论稀疏9倍的图。

Conclusion: GRANITE为稀疏动态图中的鲁棒学习提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了对抗拜占庭攻击的能力。

Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users
iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring
peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and
maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph
dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse
topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine
(model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes
attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by
introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic
graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two
key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol
(HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial
influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which
leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with
formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence
with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering
of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs
than dictated by current theory.

open-source framework for benchmarking plasticity optimization in deep RL.
Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods,

Conclusion: 原型方法能有效提升模拟器性能，数据驱动选择原型效果更佳。

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate
physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here,
we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional
emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the
emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to
better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric
dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a
baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The
prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even
if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through
data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in
some metrics.

Conclusion: 为创建更紧密连接预测与决策的预测系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing
prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world
applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,
which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the
importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous
methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down
predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then
dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our
method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless
communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also
improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.
This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better
connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在分子表示上存在信息丢失和偏差，而深度学习方法如GCN和LLM提供了更优的解决方案。

Method: 通过将LLM嵌入与GCN层逐层结合，实现局部结构学习和全局化学知识的融合。

Result: 混合模型F1-score达88.8%，优于GCN（87.9%）、XGBoost（85.5%）和SVM（85.4%）。

Conclusion: 混合架构显著提升了虚拟筛选性能，为药物发现提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling
the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental
validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector
machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often
leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning
approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more
expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs.
Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to
capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention
mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with
LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global
chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a
molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training
or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that
concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the
final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of
global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior
results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%),
XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Conclusion: 通过调整储层非线性与数据非线性匹配，可以优化储层计算机性能，特别是在资源受限场景下。

Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal
design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity
should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable
nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with
the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we
generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with
fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is
maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in
the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we
find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed
correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to
propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series
by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a
successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and
real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its
practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by
augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir
states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained
scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is
impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route
toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to
model.

Conclusion: 该方法在异质节点条件下有效利用代理间的相对性，同时满足个性化需求，DSLTH为其提供了理论基础。

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in
decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket
hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized
learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is
represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a
personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating
and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are
fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware
implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss
function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity.
Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an
intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in
each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data
distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among
agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node
conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it
as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the
validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

Conclusion: CTO-TP框架有效解决了MEC中的资源分配和性能优化问题，为未来网络提供了高效的任务卸载方案。

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of
Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing
resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising
solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge
servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy
consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading
can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex
scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in
centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission
latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a
latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with
Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters
edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing
asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation
across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the
proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87%
energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

Conclusion: TACO有效解决了非独立同分布数据的挑战，提升了联邦学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge
clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL)
training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various
methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can
achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first
investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform
model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such
over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in
model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that
addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained,
client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local
models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading
FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication
rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation
overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a
lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires
minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized
model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL
convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive
experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable
performance in practice.

Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications
is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently
cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures
and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes
in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning
tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces
for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road
scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this
learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of
road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph
representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use
case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to
perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and
proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning
methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with
penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets.
In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models
of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded
satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep
learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods
has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance
index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's
concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption
does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be
badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to
assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark
data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different
methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size,
non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these
tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at

Conclusion: TileLang通过简化编程模型，显著提升了AI内核开发的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both
training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow
patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence
of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels
remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak
performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage
modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the
burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability
and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized
tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang
decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline)
from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and
primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow
itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous
experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art
performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread
paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and
flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.

progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing
CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for
selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by
advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a
pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically
schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The
decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,
which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to
determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is
trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning
manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the
expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also
exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的降维方法，结合了线性方法的可解释性和非线性变换的表达能力，通过高斯函数加权的线性变换实现复杂非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有降维方法（如t-SNE和PCA）在表示能力和可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过高斯函数加权的线性变换构建高维到低维的非线性映射，保留线性方法的可解释性。

Result: 模型既能实现强大的降维效果，又能提供对变换空间的透明理解，包括识别被抑制的维度和空间的扩展与收缩。

Conclusion: 该方法在降维中平衡了表达能力和可解释性，并通过用户友好的软件包促进实际应用。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and
visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA
presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the
interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear
transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between
high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear
transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables
complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability
advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed
independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality
reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for
interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for
identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.
These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and
modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the
practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software
packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and
industry.

*Bowen Deng,Chang Xu,Hao Li,Yuhao Huang,Min Hou,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TarDiff是一种新型目标导向扩散框架，通过任务特定的影响指导生成合成EHR时间序列数据，显著提升下游模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注复制真实数据的统计分布和时间依赖性，但未能确保模型性能提升，尤其是对罕见但重要条件的表示不足。

Method: TarDiff通过量化合成样本对下游模型性能的预期贡献（使用影响函数），并将这种影响梯度嵌入反向扩散过程，生成优化数据。

Result: 在六个公开EHR数据集上，TarDiff在AUPRC和AUROC上分别比现有方法提升20.4%和18.4%。

Conclusion: TarDiff不仅保留了时间保真度，还显著提升了模型性能，为医疗数据分析中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial
for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data
scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches
focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal
dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone
does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate,
limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights
the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific
clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose
TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates
task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.
Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff
optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to
improving downstream model performance through influence functions.
Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by
synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion
process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.
Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in
AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only
preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance,
offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare
analytics.

TL;DR: DROCKS是一种完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，用于时间序列分类（TSC），通过ROCKET特征实现，避免了传统客户端-服务器架构的脆弱性和隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和数据监管问题，联邦学习（FL）成为处理分布式时间序列数据的理想方法，但传统FL的客户端-服务器架构存在单点故障和隐私泄露风险。

Method: DROCKS采用完全去中心化的架构，通过节点间的结构化路径训练全局模型，每个节点优化模型并选择最有效的本地核后传递给下一个节点。

Result: 在UCR存档上的实验表明，DROCKS优于现有的客户端-服务器FL方法，同时对节点故障和恶意攻击更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DROCKS为时间序列分类提供了一种更安全、更鲁棒的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in
various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due
to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without
centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a
client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality
risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point
of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these
challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that
leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS,
the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across
federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most
effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive
experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms
state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node
failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at

### [109] [The effects of Hessian eigenvalue spectral density type on the applicability of Hessian analysis to generalization capability assessment of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17618)
*Nikita Gabdullin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络Hessian矩阵特征值谱密度（HESD）的行为及其对泛化能力的影响，提出了统一的HESD分析方法，并探讨了训练过程中HESD的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HESD行为以更好地理解神经网络损失曲面的曲率及其泛化能力，并扩展之前提出的Hessian分析方法。

Method: 通过实验分析不同优化器、数据集和预处理方法对HESD的影响，提出判断HESD类型的标准，并结合之前的泛化准则形成统一方法。

Result: 发现HESD主要为正（MP-HESD）或负（MN-HESD），MN-HESD由外部梯度操作引起，且训练中可能出现准奇异（QS）HESD。

Conclusion: 提出统一的HESD分析方法，并揭示了QS-HESD对传统Hessian特征值与损失曲面关系假设的影响。

Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the
curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization
capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on
the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves
similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their
applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of
HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has
positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various
optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation
procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence
of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed
Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose
criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN
generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed
generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.
Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence
of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and
on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues
and NN loss landscape curvature.

TL;DR: 论文提出PTCL方法，解决动态节点分类中仅依赖最终标签的问题，通过伪标签和时间课程学习策略提升性能，并贡献新数据集和统一框架FLiD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态节点分类在金融交易和学术合作等系统中至关重要，但实际场景中动态标签难以获取，而最终标签更易获得。为此，研究提出仅依赖最终标签的解决方案。

Method: PTCL方法包括时间解耦架构（分离主干网络和解码器）和时间课程学习策略（通过指数衰减函数加权伪标签）。

Result: 实验表明PTCL在真实场景中优于其他方法，并贡献了新数据集CoOAG和统一框架FLiD。

Conclusion: PTCL有效解决了动态节点分类中标签有限的问题，FLiD框架为未来研究提供了标准化支持。

Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like
financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems,
dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node
classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,
it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to
high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels
in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain
as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a
unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history
data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum
Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node
classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a
temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware
representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which
generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that
prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them
higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new
academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic
graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent
superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we
propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node
Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training
pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对共形预测方法在复杂真实环境中的有效性进行了实证分析，重点关注数据稀缺和高变异性条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究共形预测在非标准基准（如数据稀缺和高度变化的真实环境）中的表现，以验证其在复杂任务中的不确定性估计能力。

Method: 使用预训练模型（MobileNet、DenseNet、ResNet）微调有限标记数据，并通过两种校准管道（带和不带温度缩放）评估性能，关注覆盖率和预测集大小。

Result: 共形预测即使在小样本和简单非共形分数下也能提供有价值的估计；温度缩放不一定能缩小预测集，模型压缩技术具有潜力。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注噪声标签对共形预测的影响，并探索有效的模型压缩策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal
prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse
events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful
post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it
into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage
of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study
addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world
settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models
(MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to
generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of
calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature
scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and
average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how
calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and
simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable
uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not
consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of
careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight
the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal
prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based
on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact
of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore
effective model reduction strategies.

Conclusion: NPE-PF为SBI提供了无需训练、通用性强的高效解决方案，适用于广泛的随机逆问题。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to
performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic
data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions
for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as
few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,
we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models
for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN
-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for
SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks
(NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms
of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse
problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of
simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer
simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection,
training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior
robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets
that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction
for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,
easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse
problems.

hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy
through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation.
Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized
FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other
paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also
highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and
evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open
research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable,
efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电机组的智能状态监测需要大量训练数据，但数据不足会导致正常行为模型（NBM）的故障诊断不可靠。

Method: 通过CycleGAN将缺乏训练数据的风电机组SCADA数据映射到具有代表性数据的风电机组，从而应用已有NBM。

Result: 在7个差异显著的风电机组上验证，显著提升了数据稀缺情况下的故障诊断性能，F1分数提升10.3%（1个月数据）和16.8%（2周数据）。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺情况下的异常检测提供了新方向，能更早、更可靠地诊断新安装风电场的故障。

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing
downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are
commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However,
data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of
training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault
diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep
learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training
data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data.
Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an
NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We
demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7
substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault
diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most
similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs
trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1
month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The
domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered
degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The
proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly
installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to
improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

Conclusion: 患者相似性结合图分析提供了准确的预测和可解释的见解，支持早期检测和风险因素识别。

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global
health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and
mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework
for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced
explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing
clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among
patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic
Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as
inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel
transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient
similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and
t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk
clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from
the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms
baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient
similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic
use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals
clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at
\https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based
analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This
method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient
stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise
its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect
detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from
low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches
based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,
their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties
during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead
to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering
automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first
evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data
that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition
with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration
sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate
and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous
threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability
defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,
defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean
error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk
level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average
prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a
statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.
Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the
expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning
ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations,
undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial
robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM
robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and
Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial
inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's
estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy
with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only
between different models but also across categories within the same task and
between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the
need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to
compare and select models based on application-specific robustness
requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM
robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for
real-world deployment.

approach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing
831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals
and patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信号处理中分布数据的重要性日益突出，但现有神经最优传输方法主要关注两个分布之间的单一映射。

Method: 使用Transformer架构生成变长分布数据的嵌入，再通过超网络生成神经最优传输映射。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了嵌入和生成的最优传输映射的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多分布最优传输问题提供了新的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Distributional data have become increasingly prominent in modern signal
processing, highlighting the necessity of computing optimal transport (OT) maps
across multiple probability distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies on
neural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a
single map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a
novel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions.
Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from
distributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a
hypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were
conducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model
implementation and the code are provided on

Result: 实验表明MSGCN在多种多层网络结构中具有鲁棒、准确且可泛化的性能。

Conclusion: MSGCN为多层网络中的链接权重预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning
tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have
demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving
graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely
link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased
complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction
becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes
can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we
propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN),
which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer
link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to
multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across
multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link
information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable
link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network
structures.

Motivation: 边缘设备资源有限，传统数字计算架构在实时推理中需要大量内存和计算能力。

Conclusion: WISE比传统数字计算效率提升两个数量级，适用于无线连接的边缘设备。

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,
rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,
including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous
navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often
resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and
computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing
architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture
for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep
learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:
disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation
of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio
frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast
model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image
classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per
client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This
approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly
connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索在计算和数据流限制下，如何实现LLMs的实时领域适应，避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 方法结合了LoRA和最小回放机制，在医学问答、遗传学和法律三个领域进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最小回放也能显著稳定并部分恢复领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限的实际场景中部署适应性强的LLMs提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the
critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired
knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay
buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have
been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict
computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a
lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic
streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question
answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and
GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation,
forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while
catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly
stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study
contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in
resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 传统XANES光谱数据采集耗时且缺乏对光谱结构的领域知识，需要一种高效且精确的自适应采样方法。

Method: 采用知识注入的贝叶斯优化方法，结合XANES光谱特征（如吸收边和前边峰）进行自适应数据采集。

Result: 该方法仅需15-20%的传统采样点即可准确重建吸收边，吸收边误差小于0.1 eV，峰值误差小于0.03 eV，整体均方根误差小于0.005。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了XANES数据采集效率，适用于静态和动态测量，为化学变化跟踪提供了更好的时间分辨率。

Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual
elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points
which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for
efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific
knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a
knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data
collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption
edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the
absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points
typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to
determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors
less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and
overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to
traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and
catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic
XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better
time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the
degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under-
or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic
experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中高保真测试数据需求迫切，但传统方法无法满足复杂结构和语义关系的要求。

Method: 结合LLM（如Gemini）及前后处理步骤，生成符合复杂结构和语义约束的测试数据。

Result: 成功生成了支持复杂SQL查询测试的高保真数据，提升了测试覆盖率。

Conclusion: LLM方法为工业SQL代码生成服务提供了实用的测试数据生成方案。

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings
where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data
generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the
ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are
critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language
to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating
syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex
schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently
encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations
of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to
handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent
test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and
post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that
adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to
the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive
testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply
nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services,
like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the
practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data
generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating
realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of
production datasets.

Motivation: 传统全局优化方法在处理少量设计参数时有效，但随着解空间和约束复杂度的增加，需要新技术来应对微电子组件设计的挑战。

Method: 以ASIC和异构集成中介层为原型，开发并数值测试了一种基于强化学习的优化框架，重点优化了键合互连几何形状和组件布局。

Result: 该方法成功应用于满足热弹性和设计约束的高维解空间优化问题。

Conclusion: 强化学习为复杂微电子组件的多物理约束优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based
techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics
constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization
approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters,
as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases
different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the
design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large
solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional
methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and
numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded
interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components
on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This
placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a
high-dimensional solution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学科学中，多视图数据常见但传统机器学习方法忽视其结构，限制了模型表现和解释性。

Method: MVS框架通过单独训练每个视图的学习算法，交叉验证评估预测能力，并用另一算法分配权重，实现并行计算和特征降维。

Result: MVS适用于高维数据，支持自动选择重要视图，R包`mvs`提供了灵活的建模选项和缺失数据处理。

Conclusion: MVS是一种高效的多视图学习方法，`mvs`包使其易于实现和扩展。

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by
multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or
modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods
ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability
and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed
specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking
(MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train
multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a
learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of
each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another
learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their
estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large
multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these
sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive.
Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced
compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially
useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of
observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if
the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty
terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically
select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs`
makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly
accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of
levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and
provides several options for missing data handling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IT安全领域，异常检测对于识别系统异常至关重要，但现有量子自编码器方法仅适用于单变量数据，无法满足企业级多变量时间序列的需求。

Method: 提出了一种专为MTS AD设计的QAE框架，通过理论开发和实验验证，证明了其在性能和参数效率上的优势。

Result: 实验表明，该QAE框架在性能上与基于神经网络的自动编码器相当，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: 该QAE框架是企业级半监督异常检测的可行且高效的选择。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events
that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT
security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware
infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud
systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate
time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of
quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional
latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One
approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method
with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior
applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data,
limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we
introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards
enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the
architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with
neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.
We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and
show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for
semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

Method: 通过理论分析，建立了对抗训练量子分类器的泛化误差边界，并探讨了量子嵌入的影响。

Result: 泛化误差随样本量增加以$1/\sqrt{m}$下降；高维输入下对抗训练样本复杂度增加可忽略；量子嵌入选择仅影响希尔伯特空间维度。

Conclusion: 对抗训练能有效提升量子分类器的鲁棒性，且在高维输入下成本较低，为量子机器学习安全性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate
their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is
adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an
attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on
the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when
tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds
quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to
adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as
$1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding.
For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find
that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$,
the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional
training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In
contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state
$\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization
error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space
dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We
validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中固定长度输出的效率问题，动态适应图像内容以减少计算成本。

Conclusion: DyMU适用于多种VLM架构，提供用户对计算成本的控制，是一种高效且灵活的方法。

Abstract: We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically
reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while
maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components.
First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token
embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the
inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second,
Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large
language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of
a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional
fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token
compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,
making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.
Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that
DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving
comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,
including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,
through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts
token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,
provides users more control over computational costs. Project page:

Abstract: Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive
results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily
integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,
autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a
natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text
generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image
generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)
guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that
this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image
content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an
autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color
of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this
work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in
any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each
patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune
the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our
experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces
better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training
costs and no extra annotations.

Motivation: 现有足球MLLM依赖时间先验，无法端到端处理视频；传统方法复杂且无法捕捉全局上下文。TimeSoccer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出TimeSoccer模型，结合MoFA-Select（训练无关的运动感知帧压缩模块）和互补训练范式，支持长视频理解。

Result: 实验表明TimeSoccer在SDVC任务上达到最先进性能，生成高质量评论且时间对齐准确。

Conclusion: TimeSoccer为足球视频的端到端描述提供了高效解决方案，具有全局上下文建模能力。

Abstract: Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long
matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise
temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.
However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption
generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some
traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to
capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the
above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for
Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.
TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,
enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long
video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a
training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects
representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates
complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle
long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer
achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end
form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and
strong semantic relevance.

Abstract: The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs,
plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance,
lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of
gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across
the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information
for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes
like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However,
traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ
hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To
overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful
alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in
AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering
various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid
methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these
methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide
targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges
in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and
lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to
serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative
solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

Conclusion: 该方法为提升T2V模型性能提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to
their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these
models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos
when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or
sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with
training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce \(\projectname\), a novel zero-training video
refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically
enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our
approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video
representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and
their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the
original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and
proprietary T2V models demonstrate that \(\projectname\) significantly enhances
temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost $40\%$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAF是一种基于代理的、无需训练的框架，通过多模态从粗到细的注意力聚焦实现视频理解，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解，尤其是长视频理解，因信息冗余和复杂性而具有挑战性，需要模型在全局层面策略性地分配注意力。

Method: MCAF通过多模态信息分层聚焦相关帧，并采用扩张时间扩展机制避免遗漏关键细节，同时引入自反馈机制调整注意力。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Next-QA、IntentQA和Video-MME数据集上，MCAF分别实现了5%、0.2%、0.3%的性能提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCAF通过创新的注意力聚焦策略，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding,
particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or
image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with
redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a
global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an
agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through
Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its
ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant
to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly
relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation
between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a
dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial
details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In
addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the
confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying
these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to
capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy.
MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the
EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the
leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms
the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the
Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length,
MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.

Abstract: To improve the segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions (microaneurysms,
hemorrhages, exudates, and soft exudates), we implemented a binary segmentation
method specific to each type of lesion. As post-segmentation, we combined the
individual model outputs into a single image to better analyze the lesion
types. This approach facilitated parameter optimization and improved accuracy,
effectively overcoming challenges related to dataset limitations and annotation
complexity. Specific preprocessing steps included cropping and applying
contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to the L channel of the LAB
image. Additionally, we employed targeted data augmentation techniques to
further refine the model's efficacy. Our methodology utilized the DeepLabv3+
model, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the
efficacy of innovative strategies in advancing medical image analysis,
particularly in the precise segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The
IDRID dataset was utilized to validate and demonstrate the robustness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人辅助微创手术（RAMIS）中，立体视差估计对深度信息获取至关重要，但现有方法在精度、鲁棒性和推理速度之间难以平衡。

Method: 提出StereoMamba架构，包含FE-Mamba模块增强空间依赖性，以及MFF模块融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在SCARED基准测试中，StereoMamba的EPE为2.64 px，深度MAE为2.55 mm，推理速度为21.28 FPS，且在SSIM和PSNR上表现最佳。

Conclusion: StereoMamba在精度、鲁棒性和效率上达到最优平衡，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Stereo disparity estimation is crucial for obtaining depth information in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). While current deep learning
methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an
optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address
these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is
specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is
based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances
long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To
effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a
novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the
state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba
achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the
second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining
an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images
(1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from
warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right
image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761),
exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FRAG的框架，通过选择输入中的相关帧而非处理长上下文，提升了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在长视频和多页文档任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型在长输入（如多页文档和长视频）方面取得进展，但其模型规模和性能仍受限于计算成本。FRAG旨在通过选择关键帧而非处理整个长上下文来解决这一问题。

Method: FRAG框架首先独立评分每个帧，然后通过Top-K选择最高分帧，仅基于这些帧生成最终输出，避免了长上下文处理。

Result: 实验表明，FRAG显著提升了LLaVA-OneVision和InternVL2模型的性能，在长视频和文档理解任务中达到SOTA，如InternVL2-76B在MLVU和Video-MME上分别提升5.8%和3.7%，在MP-DocVQA上提升超过20%。

Conclusion: FRAG通过简单的帧选择机制，无需微调即可显著提升现有LMMs在长输入任务中的性能，为长上下文处理提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent
works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and
long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context
models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and
inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long
inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented
Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the
input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.
The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,
which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest
scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this
frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page
documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,
LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG
consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art
performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,
FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on
Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA
compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is

*Weiran Pan,Wei Wei,Feida Zhu,Yong Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的样本选择方法，通过跟踪模型预测置信度趋势而非仅依赖损失值，准确区分正确标注但难学习的样本与错误标注样本，缓解了传统方法在精度和召回率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将小损失样本视为正确标注，但一些正确标注的样本因难学习可能在训练初期表现出高损失，类似错误标注样本。这导致基于损失阈值的样本选择在精度和召回率之间存在权衡。

Method: 通过跟踪标注标签与其他类别之间的置信度差距趋势（使用Mann-Kendall Test评估），若所有置信度差距呈上升趋势，则样本被视为可能正确标注。该方法可作为即插即用组件集成到现有技术中。

Result: 在多个标准基准和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法提升了现有噪声标签学习技术的性能。

Conclusion: 通过分析置信度趋势而非损失值，该方法有效区分了正确标注但难学习的样本与错误标注样本，缓解了样本选择中的权衡问题，提升了噪声标签学习的性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the
presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss
samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are
inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar
to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a
threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off
between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss
many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher
threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this
issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet
hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off
dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction
confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations
show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence
for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes.
Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the
annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends
using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly
labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a
plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample
selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world
datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing
methods for learning with noisy labels.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has
not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns.
Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and
control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework
for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging
the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine
learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion
Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to
train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception
architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting
(NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and
generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA)
for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter
space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72%
and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making
process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This
framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially
aiding healthcare providers in early detection and diagnosis, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation
learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have
demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific
modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in
this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches
that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines
these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order
to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future
directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We
discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the
need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor
aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches
leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to
multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further
harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote
sensing observations.

Motivation: 现有遥感技术在复杂城市环境中缺乏精度，而街景图像能提供地面视角，捕捉更多与土地利用相关的人类和社会活动。然而，现有基于街景的方法依赖于监督分类，面临高质量标注数据稀缺和泛化能力不足的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法基于地理数据的空间一致性（Tobler定律），适用于街景图像可用的多种场景，为土地利用制图提供了灵活且可定制的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban land use classification and mapping are critical for urban planning,
resource management, and environmental monitoring. Existing remote sensing
techniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the
absence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images
provide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities
relevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based
methods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the
scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across
diverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive
clustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to
enhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment
of the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to
land use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We
experimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged
street view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the
universal spatial coherence of geospatial data ("Tobler's law"), it can be
adapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable
scalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating. The code will be
available at https://github.com/lin102/CCGP.

Conclusion: STCL策略有效提升了隐写模型的性能，适用于多种算法框架。

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow
network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this
paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for
deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected
for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and
gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty
evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training
scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the
consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher
models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from
easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points
is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and
accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public
datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image
steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple
algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and
decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model
under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis
scores. You can find our code at

Conclusion: DARai为人类中心应用提供了重要的数据集支持，并展示了多模态传感器融合的潜力。

Abstract: Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced
"Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to
understand human activities in real-world settings. DARai consists of
continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10
different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors
including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial
measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors,
biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.
  To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three
levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks,
(ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and
(iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for
actions. The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of
L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are
shared between L2 actions. The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows
counterfactual activities in the dataset.
  Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai
in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.
Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for
recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all
hierarchical annotation levels. To highlight the limitations of individual
sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's
multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases,
including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants.
However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low

(memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm,
EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a
single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our
hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring
primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low
level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity
recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities
achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity
recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model
parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current
IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a
sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of
activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

Motivation: 探索NTSR1激活和偏向信号传导的机制，以开发针对成瘾相关疾病的潜在治疗策略。

Method: 结合计算和实验方法，包括分子动力学模拟、马尔可夫状态模型、时间通信网络分析、定点突变和构象生物传感器。

Result: 揭示了NTSR1激活的动态逐步机制，发现了一个位于受体胞内区域的潜在变构位点。

Conclusion: 研究为理解NTSR1的原子水平机制提供了新见解，并为开发变构调节剂提供了潜在策略。

Abstract: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a member of the Class A G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily, plays an important role in modulating dopaminergic
neuronal activity and eliciting opioid-independent analgesia. Recent studies
suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish
drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue
for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a
novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic
band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal
communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational
biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and
biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and
activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields
valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network,
non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we
identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the
receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway.
Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of
NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a
potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the
realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.

TL;DR: S2Vec是一种自监督框架，用于学习通用的地理空间嵌入，通过S2几何库分区和掩码自编码生成任务无关的嵌入，并在社会经济预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建可扩展的通用地理空间表示对地理空间人工智能应用至关重要。

Method: 使用S2几何库将大区域划分为离散S2单元，将特征向量栅格化为图像，并应用掩码自编码生成嵌入。

Result: 在三个大规模社会经济预测任务中表现优异，且与图像嵌入结合可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: S2Vec能学习有效的地理空间表示，并与其他数据模态互补。

Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial
for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces
S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial
embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into
discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as
images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode
the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture
local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate
S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its
competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We
also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based
embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve
performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective
general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data
modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.

Method: 构建虚拟城市模型，结合调查数据建模行为选择，开发可扩展的模拟框架。

Result: 实现了4000多个代理的复杂行为模拟，并通过实验验证了生成行为的真实性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效模拟复杂城市移动行为，为城市规划和行为研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban
behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices in
modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale
population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual
city that features multiple functional buildings and transportation modes.
Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility
preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a
simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while
remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the
realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and
macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful
experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and
identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: SCRAG是一个基于社交计算的预测框架，用于预测社区对社交媒体帖子的反应，结合检索增强生成技术提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在动态社交媒体环境中预测社区反应的局限性，如静态训练数据和幻觉问题。

Method: 整合LLMs与检索增强生成技术，检索历史社区反应和外部知识，用于预测新帖子的社区反应。

Result: 在X平台上的六种场景中，关键评估指标平均提升超过10%，能捕捉多样意识形态和细微差别。

Conclusion: SCRAG为需要准确洞察社区反应的应用提供了有效的社交计算工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social
computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical
social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to
craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public
figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other
applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and
social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved
remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their
reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit
their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media
environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing.
Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target
community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and
(ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject
time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the
responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive
experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested
with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on
average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its
effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a
social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights
into community responses are crucial.

*Felix Kares,Timo Speith,Hanwei Zhang,Markus Langer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了三种流行的显著性图方法（LIME、Grad-CAM和Guided Backpropagation）在不同评估方法下的表现，发现评估结果不一致，并探讨了用户研究与数学指标在可解释AI评估中的互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性图是解释神经网络分类的常用方法，但如何评估这些方法仍是一个开放问题。论文旨在比较不同评估方法（主观用户测量、客观用户测量和数学指标）对三种显著性图方法的评价结果。

Method: 通过一项涉及166名被试的受试者间研究，测试了三种显著性图方法在主观信任和满意度、用户理解能力提升以及数学指标评分上的差异，并分析了数学指标与用户理解能力的关系。

Result: 研究发现评估方法之间结果不一致：主观信任和满意度无差异，Grad-CAM最能提升用户理解能力，而Guided Backpropagation在数学指标上表现最佳。部分数学指标与用户理解能力相关，但关系反直觉。

Conclusion: 论文强调了用户研究和数学指标在评估可解释AI方法时的互补性，并指出当前评估方法之间存在分歧，需进一步研究以达成共识。

Abstract: Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of
(convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how
best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods
commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and
mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map
approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between
subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1)
for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and
satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities
and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map
achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical
metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation
methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e.,
there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved
users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable
mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics
were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often
counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates
concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in
the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI面部评估工具对自我物化、自尊和情绪的心理影响，发现其可能强化外貌相关的不安全感，并存在性别差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI面部评估工具如何影响个体的心理状态，尤其是自我物化和自尊，并关注性别差异。

Method: 使用两种版本的面部分析工具（批评性和中性），测量参与者的自我物化、自尊、情绪反应、外貌增强行为及感知社会情绪。

Result: 高自我物化和低自尊与外貌增强行为相关；中性工具仍引发负面情绪；女性更倾向数字增强且较少感知他人情绪影响。

Conclusion: AI工具可能无意中强化社会偏见，需负责任的设计。未来研究将探讨训练数据中的人类意识形态如何影响工具输出及用户态度。

Abstract: AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate
appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the
psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and
emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used
distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9
years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed
validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items
measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and
perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high
self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement
behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still
evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit
feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences
emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital
enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These
findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing
social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and
development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in
the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these,
in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动驾驶车辆（AVs）如何满足乘客的信息需求，强调个性化、适应性沟通策略的重要性，并基于三项实证研究提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的普及受到信息沟通问题的阻碍，现有研究未能充分考虑不同人群、目标和驾驶情境的多样性需求。

Method: 通过三项实证研究：1）极端驾驶环境中的沟通策略优化；2）错误沟通系统的后果分析；3）利用机器学习预测个人信任因素。

Result: 研究发现需要任务敏感、情境适应的沟通策略，并强调个性化设计的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文主张透明、适应性强且个性化的AV系统，为设计者、研究者和政策制定者提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the
informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our
ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving
contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success.
Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and
situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate
to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV
complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between
different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and
adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical
studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance
driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving
environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive,
modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and
goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication
systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I
use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in
AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and
concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent,
adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals,
and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV
interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers,
researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete
domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational
awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新型虚拟现实（VR）移动技术，通过自然语言实现上下文感知导航，与传统控制器和语音转向方法相比，具有类似的可用性和沉浸感，同时提升用户注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音移动方法依赖固定指令集，限制了交互的自然性和灵活性，因此需要一种更自然、灵活的双手自由移动方案。

Method: 提出LLM驱动的移动技术，通过自然语言实现导航，并与控制器传送和语音转向方法进行比较。评估包括眼动数据分析（SHAP）和标准化问卷（可用性、沉浸感、晕动症、认知负荷）。

Result: LLM方法在可用性、沉浸感和晕动症方面与传统方法相当，但能提升用户注意力。SHAP分析显示不同技术的视觉注意力和认知处理模式存在差异。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的移动技术是一种舒适、自然的双手自由替代方案，特别适合提升无障碍性。

Abstract: Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual
reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable
alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on
handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often
depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of
interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by
large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual
environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate
three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering,
and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include
eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP
analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence,
cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our
findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable
usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like
teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural
language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention
within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to
these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and
pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of
visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method
can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in
supporting accessibility.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于CSI的大规模WiFi室内定位框架，解决了未标记数据利用不足和CSI测量异质性等问题，通过图结构和预训练任务提升了定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CSI在WiFi室内定位中具有潜力，但其部署规模和商业化程度不及RSSI，主要受限于小规模环境评估和数据异质性。本文旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 提出了一种基于图结构的CSI学习框架，设计了预训练任务以利用未标记数据，并采用置信感知微调策略增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在覆盖5层楼和25,600平方米的实验中，实现了2.17米的中位定位误差和99.49%的楼层准确率，MAE降低了18.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模ISAC部署提供了有效的CSI定位解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its
fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in
WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based
approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and
commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are
developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their
generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a
large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points
(APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the
underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI
measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based
learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC
deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based
structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further
design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors
to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we
introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of
localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five
floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters
and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7%
reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing
baseline.

Result: 研究发现当前治理方法未能有效监管MTE，并揭示了导致这些漏洞的错误假设。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要改进AI治理方法，以更有效地应对AIG-NCII的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect
the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated
Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as
"deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or
"MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200
"nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII
within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance
methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively
regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining
these gaps.

various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and

Result: 发现DFMs的解释困难可能源于其大规模模型的内在特性，而非暂时性技术问题。

Conclusion: 需重新思考如何验证和治理这些强大技术，以应对其解释性挑战。

Abstract: Deep Foundation Models (DFMs) offer unprecedented capabilities but their
increasing complexity presents profound challenges to understanding their
internal workings-a critical need for ensuring trust, safety, and
accountability. As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental
question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles,
awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from
\emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale
models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining
the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations
encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this
inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory
explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the
verification and governance of these powerful technologies.

Conclusion: 执法领域的动态复杂性决定了系统难以完全自动化，需持续人工参与和反馈。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday
lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law
enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative
research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to
identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and
understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these
systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of
processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime
detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements
for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to
be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of
having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to
interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy.
To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users
need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and
government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and
monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the
system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed
they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the
system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the
system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature
of the law enforcement domain.

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power
generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These
assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the
units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power
generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and
market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of
German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on
their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units
between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms
time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of
peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical
flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around
half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for
more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the
low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their
flexibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个五阶段跨学科框架，用于在机器学习模型开发中整合法律与技术分析，以解决法律合规与预测性能之间的复杂权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习技术与法律的交叉带来了新的复杂性，现有方法未能充分解决法律合规与模型性能之间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入一个五阶段跨学科框架，结合法律与技术分析，指导法律义务的操作化选择和评估指标设计。

Result: 该框架能够帮助设计法律合规且高性能的机器学习模型，并通过反洗钱案例研究验证其应用。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了法律概念分析与机器学习确定性需求之间的空白，为法律与技术的结合提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the
complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the
law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML
model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be
operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require
"indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate
operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit
multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with
varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates
unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with
predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or
heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations.
Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they
either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model
development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we
introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and
ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates
designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing
models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for
operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical
feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric
values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law
and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its
application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

### [165] [Can deep neural networks learn biological vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16940)
*Drew Linsley,Pinyuan Feng,Thomas Serre*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 近年来，深度神经网络（DNNs）在计算机视觉任务上的性能提升并未进一步与灵长类神经反应对齐，反而出现分歧。作者认为未来的生物视觉计算模型需脱离人工智能的框架，专注于模拟人类视觉的数据和训练方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨为何现代DNNs在视觉任务上的性能提升未能继续与灵长类神经反应对齐，并提出未来生物视觉模型的发展方向。

Method: 分析DNNs与灵长类视觉系统的差异，并提出基于生物视觉的数据和训练方法。

Result: 现代DNNs依赖的视觉特征与灵长类不同，导致性能提升与神经反应对齐趋势逆转。

Conclusion: 未来的生物视觉模型需专注于模拟人类视觉的数据和训练方式，而非依赖传统AI框架。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate
neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend
raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would
come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence.
However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human
or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs
learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks.
Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We
propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop
algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of
internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning
models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines,
and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that
are in use today.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理知识的特征学习方法，通过结合物理定律和量纲分析构建非线性特征映射，提升模型可解释性和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征学习方法忽略了特征的物理意义，限制了模型的可解释性，尤其在科学应用中。

Method: 利用物理定律和量纲分析构建非线性特征映射，增强模型解释性，并通过特征排序识别未知物理机制。

Result: 该方法在回归任务和分类任务中提升了预测性能，同时支持新物理方程的发现。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识的特征学习方法不仅提高了模型性能，还增强了可解释性，为科学应用中的机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional
relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The
classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on
applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their
physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in
scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to
feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed
by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model
interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the
identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims
to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification
skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while
also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the
context of explainable machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTE估计方法主要针对二元治疗情况，且依赖黑盒模型，限制了其在多臂试验中的适用性和可解释性。

Method: 采用基于规则的集成方法，包括规则生成、规则集成和HTE估计，兼顾预测准确性和可解释性。

Result: 模拟研究和实际数据应用表明，该方法在偏差和估计准确性上优于现有方法，同时提供了更清晰的协变量影响解释。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多臂HTE估计中准确性与可解释性之间的空白，为精准医学提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical
research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among
individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine.
While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world
applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE
estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely
on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in
multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable
machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method
employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule
ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and
interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data
applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against
state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that
our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with
those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework
allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects,
facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and
interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE
estimation, supporting precision medicine.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EnVAE的新型无似然生成框架，通过能量评分构建重建损失，解决了传统VAE因似然函数选择不当导致的模糊重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE通常使用预定义的似然函数（如各向同性高斯分布），容易导致似然错误设定，造成模糊重建和低数据保真度，尤其是在高维数据（如图像）中。

Method: 提出EnVAE框架，采用确定性解码器和能量评分（一种适当的评分规则）构建重建损失，无需显式参数密度函数。进一步提出FEnVAE，通过解码器的局部平滑性和潜在变量后验分布的锐度，提高计算效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，EnVAE在标准基准测试中优于基于似然的基线方法，实现了更优的重建和生成质量。

Conclusion: EnVAE为生成模型提供了一种通用、可扩展且统计上严谨的替代方案，适用于灵活和非参数分布学习。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder
with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the
data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this
choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry
reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data
such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel
likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and
employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the
reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring
explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational
inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE},
based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample
training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with
minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
\textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared
to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and
statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric
distribution learning in generative modeling.

TL;DR: 论文评估了深度高斯过程（DGPs）和深度Sigma点过程（DSPPs）在回归和分类任务中的不确定性量化表现，发现DSPPs在分布内校准表现良好，但深度集成在分布偏移下更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习中可靠的不确定性估计至关重要，但DGPs和DSPPs在分布偏移下的校准和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 在回归（CASP数据集）和分类（ESR数据集）任务中评估DGPs和DSPPs，使用MAE、准确性、NLL和ECE等指标，并测试合成特征级分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: DSPPs在分布内校准表现良好，但深度集成在分布偏移下的性能和校准均优于GP方法。

Conclusion: 深度GP方法在分布内校准表现良好，但在分布偏移下的鲁棒性需谨慎评估；深度集成是更鲁棒的基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep
Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs
hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification
grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and
robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles
remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP
dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive
performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various
synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide
strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations.
However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in
both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based
methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the
observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline,
suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration,
their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful
evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链的共识机制（如PoW和PoS）在安全性和效率之间存在权衡，PoW资源消耗高，PoS可能导致中心化。AI模型的计算需求加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI)，通过让工作者完成AI任务（如语言处理或图像分析）来获得代币，并将代币质押以保障网络安全。

Result: PoUI结合了安全性和实用性，通过智能合约协调去中心化节点（任务发布者、市场协调者、工作者和验证者）管理任务和奖励。

Conclusion: PoUI是一种创新的共识机制，既能保障区块链安全，又能利用AI任务的实际价值，为资源利用和去中心化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent data management in
decentralized systems, supporting applications from cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin to tokenizing real-world assets like property. Its scalability and
sustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency.
Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive
computations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in
Ethereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency,
offering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth
concentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose
Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI,
workers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn
coins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical
utility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and
validators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.

Conclusion: 现有软件（如QuPath）可为乳腺癌H&E切片中的TILs评估提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we built an end-to-end tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
assessment pipeline within QuPath, demonstrating the potential of easily
accessible tools to perform complex tasks in a fully automatic fashion. First,
we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and
other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI)
to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a
pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used
the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs
from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the
TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL
levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores,
achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating
previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can
offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of
breast cancer.

Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence,
have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years,
particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of
geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually
expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the
full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To
address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically
explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with
geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture
selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed
analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular,
considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of
geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges.
Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of
foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational
efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby
improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive
summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not
only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of
foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their
application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in
the field.

Motivation: 研究旨在展示预训练的大型观测模型（如EarthPT）如何通过微调，实现精细、动态的土地覆盖监测，为自然资本管理和保护提供可扩展工具。

Method: Dargana通过微调EarthPT模型，专注于生成10米分辨率的树冠覆盖分类，区分针叶树和阔叶树类型。

Conclusion: Dargana展示了预训练模型在土地覆盖监测中的高效性和可扩展性，为自然资本管理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series
foundation model that achieves specialisation using <3% of its pre-training
data volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to
generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m
resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall,
UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a
PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine
structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can
track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our
results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can
be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space,
providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and
conservation.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: HydroStartML是一种机器学习模拟器，用于加速水文模型中的初始水位配置计算，显著减少传统迭代计算的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的水文模型初始水位配置计算（DTWT）需要耗时的迭代计算，尤其是在远离稳态的情况下。为了提高效率，开发了HydroStartML。

Method: HydroStartML基于美国本土的稳态DTWT数据训练，利用电导率和地表坡度等数据预测流域的初始DTWT配置。

Result: 使用HydroStartML预测的初始配置能更快收敛，且对未见过的地形配置也能准确预测，显著减少计算时间，尤其是在深水位区域。

Conclusion: HydroStartML为结合机器学习与传统模拟的混合方法提供了可能，提高了水文预测的准确性和效率，有助于水资源管理和环境研究。

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment
is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated
models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this
involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant
atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model
spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated
time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady
state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine
learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the
contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like
conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective
watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML
predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations
like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations
close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training,
and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in
regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that
blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive
accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management
and understanding complex environmental interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化HRTF能提高定位精度，但测量过程耗时且需要无噪声环境，现有方法仍需控制环境。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 结合HRTF Denoisy U-Net进行去噪，使用AE-GAN从三个测量点实现上采样。

Result: 方法在log-spectral distortion (LSD)误差为5.41 dB，余弦相似度损失为0.0070，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了HRTF上采样的效率，减少了测量需求，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how
sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing
spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve
localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and
requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to
reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a
controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to
address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample
sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy
U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN)
for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a
log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of
0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Result: 在多个声音分离任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ClearSep在自然音频场景中具有显著潜力，推动了声音分离技术的发展。

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding
to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory
perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio
for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio
collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose
ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose
complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby
allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two
remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and
use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside
model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,
we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated
independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound
separation in natural audio scenarios. For more examples and detailed results,

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI
capabilities but pose considerable challenges for deployment on edge devices
due to high computational demands, memory bandwidth constraints, and energy
consumption. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an efficient
framework for deploying the Qwen2.5-0.5B model on the Xilinx Kria KV260 edge
platform, a heterogeneous system integrating an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with
reconfigurable FPGA logic. Leveraging Activation-aware Weight Quantization

both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a
hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive
operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively
balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our
framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original
model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）在处理长文本序列时因GPU内存限制导致的容量与带宽权衡问题，特别是解码阶段的多头注意力（MHA）内存瓶颈。

Method: 提出L3系统，包括硬件重新设计以解决DIMM-PIM的数据布局和计算元素不匹配问题，通信优化以隐藏数据传输开销，以及自适应调度器以最大化设备间并行性。

Result: 实验表明，L3比最先进的HBM-PIM解决方案快6.1倍，同时显著提高了批处理大小。

Conclusion: L3通过硬件-软件协同设计，有效解决了LLM解码阶段的内存瓶颈，为未来LLM推理提供了可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text
sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory
capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its
capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves
capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the
critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention
(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and
high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this
operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software
co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three
innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and
computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference
utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data
transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler
coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.
Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup
over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch
sizes.

TL;DR: AdjointDiffusion是一种结合扩散模型和伴随梯度优化的物理引导框架，用于高效设计自由形态光子器件，显著减少仿真需求并提高可制造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆向设计方法（如全局优化或深度学习）存在仿真需求高、后处理复杂等问题，需要一种更高效且可制造的设计方法。

Method: 通过训练扩散模型生成二进制掩模，并在推理过程中注入伴随梯度优化，引导生成高优值解。

Result: 在弯曲波导和CMOS图像传感器颜色路由器设计中，AdjointDiffusion在效率和可制造性上优于现有非线性优化器，且仿真需求显著降低。

Conclusion: AdjointDiffusion提供了一种高效、仿真需求低且可制造的光子器件设计方法，开源实现可供使用。

Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the
vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication
constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human
intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often
involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning
strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To
overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided
framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling
process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion
network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During
inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject
this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative
process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional
post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design
problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such
as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders
of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning
approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization
schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a
streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for
next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于客户画像（persona）的用户表示方法GPLR，结合预训练LLM和随机游走技术，提高了推荐和客户分群的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的用户嵌入难以理解和结合外部知识，限制了客户分群、搜索导航和产品推荐等应用的效果。

Method: 提出GPLR方法，利用预训练LLM推断客户画像，并通过随机游走技术扩展至其他用户；进一步提出RevAff算法，优化计算效率。

Result: 在三个真实电商数据集上，基于画像的表示显著提升了推荐模型的性能（NDCG@K和F1-Score@K提升达12%）。

Conclusion: 客户画像提供了一种可读性强且信息丰富的用户表示方法，显著提升了电商应用的性能。

Abstract: In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.
Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer
behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to
understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of
applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product
recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the
customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a
customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization
of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain
Hunters.
  This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas
from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user
representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution
GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer
personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to
only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict
personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides
an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of
the exact solution by a factor of at least
$O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of
customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We
evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of
accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks
using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that
integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art
graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K
and F1-Score@K.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA)框架，用于动态个性化推荐，通过累积结构实时适应用户兴趣变化和新文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区平台需要动态个性化推荐，但实时优化模型以适应变化在大规模工业场景中仍具挑战性。

Method: IRA框架包含两个关键机制：1) Interest Units捕捉用户兴趣并通过累积更新强化或淡化；2) 基于语义关系的检索过程，减少对点击信号的依赖。

Result: IRA在真实数据集上验证有效，并已部署在NAVER的CAFE平台。

Conclusion: IRA能够持续适应用户兴趣变化，提供细粒度个性化推荐，不受历史训练分布限制。

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and
recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new
documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time
remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this,
we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an
efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions
through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest
Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while
reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval
process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based
solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to
mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with
the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences,
ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by
past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the
Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为双个体遗传算法（Dual-Individual GA）的增强遗传算法，用于优化二分类任务的神经网络，如猫与非猫分类。该方法通过Leader和Follower两个参数集进行交叉，分别专注于开发和探索，并展示了优于传统梯度方法的性能。

Motivation: 传统的梯度方法在神经网络优化中可能存在收敛速度慢或陷入局部最优的问题。本文旨在通过双个体遗传算法解决这些问题，同时减少对人工调整网络架构的依赖。

Method: 提出双个体遗传算法，使用Leader（开发）和Follower（探索）两个参数集进行交叉，并引入自适应层维度机制，自动优化网络架构。

Result: 实验结果显示，Dual-Individual GA在三层网络上达到99.04%训练准确率和80%测试准确率（成本=0.034），优于传统梯度方法（98%训练准确率和80%测试准确率，成本=0.092）。

Conclusion: 双个体遗传算法在神经网络优化中表现出高效性和有效性，尤其在减少人工干预和提升性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called
Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural
networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat
classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover,
represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on
exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed
positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving
diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed
positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or
roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive
layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer
architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter
sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by
Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior
performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental
results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and
80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture
[12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98%
training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer
network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural
networks.

Result: 研究发现生物机制并非必须用于生成稀疏脉冲模式，并提供了新的理论解释和见解。

Conclusion: 固定不应期SNN架构为序列建模提供了一种有效解决方案，同时简化了模型设计。

Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have
achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural
networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another
alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN
architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1)
Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence
modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset
mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically
under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in
SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these
challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental
mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in
binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such
biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking
patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately
propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种非线性对等感知成本估计算法（N-PACE），用于解决不完全信息动态博弈中的协调问题，通过建模对方的学习动态实现快速无偏学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设一方为完全信息专家，导致估计偏差和协调失败，需改进。

Method: 使用迭代线性二次近似非线性博弈，建模对方学习动态并推断其目标函数。

Result: N-PACE实现快速无偏学习，支持意图通信，提升任务完成与安全性。

Conclusion: N-PACE有效解决了动态博弈中的协调问题，为多智能体系统提供了新工具。

Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum
dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly
known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games
presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear
underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that
one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead
to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we
propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for
general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ)
approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models
the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective
functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective
function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety
assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent
communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's
learning dynamics.

Motivation: 解决多智能体控制、人机交互等领域中信息不完全的线性二次微分博弈问题，尤其是当双方均不了解对方成本函数时的复杂性。

Method: 提出PACE框架，将对方视为学习智能体而非静态最优智能体，建模其学习动态以推断其成本函数参数。

Result: 理论证明了参数估计的收敛性和系统状态的稳定性，数值研究表明PACE在稳定性和收敛速度上优于假设对方信息完全的方法。

Conclusion: PACE框架通过实时学习对方成本参数，有效解决了信息不完全的微分博弈问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic
differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered
in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation
methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such
linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati
equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information,
particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework
for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats
its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models
their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function
parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each
other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state
observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we
provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and
the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies,
we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits
PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having
complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Conclusion: 该算法可作为快速预处理步骤，提升pMC验证的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with
unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification
for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been
efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as
asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we
first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a
given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for
the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value
equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and
monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence
classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the
collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant
reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing
algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used
as a fast pre-processing step in practice.

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic
loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale
with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the
key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully
understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to
anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they
only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale
statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive
patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an
interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption
characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent
diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build
upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)
continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to
separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive
regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption
rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.
The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV
discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We
evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its
correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish
different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we
conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to
disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can
adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying
proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

Result: 在1,633个恶意包数据集上，RuleLLM生成了763条规则（452 YARA和311 Semgrep），准确率85.2%，召回率91.8%，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: RuleLLM展示了自动化规则生成的潜力，并提出了一套规则分类法（11类38子类）。

Abstract: Today's security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by
experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain
attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS
ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its
input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in
software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three
subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate
RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted
experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are
promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a
precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art

Abstract: Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software
engineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as
software maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while
transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract
semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel
approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful
topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic
modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code.
To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them
against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from
existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated
summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code
structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully
applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation

*Murali Sridharan,Mika Mäntylä,Leevi Rantala*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了“老化债务”（AD）的概念，通过源代码注释中的“自认老化债务”（SAAD）研究软件老化，并提出分类法以量化开源软件中的AD类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注运行时指标（如内存和性能），而忽略了源代码注释等演化指标。本文旨在通过SAAD填补这一空白，量化软件老化带来的维护成本。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合定性和定量分析，从源代码注释中提取SAAD模式，并构建分类法（Active和Dormant AD），用于量化开源软件中的AD。

Result: 分析9000+开源仓库发现，21%存在SAAD，其中Dormant AD是主要类型。分类法有效区分了软件老化的不同阶段。

Conclusion: 随着软件规模增长，老化问题日益突出。提出的分类法有助于研究和实践，支持更主动的维护策略。

Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic
runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary
indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues
within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD),
representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep
software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed
in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a
mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to
detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the
source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing
the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a
taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its
associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types
of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes
temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis
of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than
21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD
dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting
a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As
software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance
challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software
aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance
strategies.

### [193] [Towards a HIPAA Compliant Agentic AI System in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17669)
*Subash Neupane,Shaswata Mitra,Sudip Mittal,Shahram Rahimi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种符合HIPAA标准的Agentic AI框架，通过动态、上下文感知的策略执行确保合规性，包括ABAC、混合PHI清理管道和不可变审计跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的Agentic AI系统在临床工作流中的应用增加，处理敏感医疗数据时需严格遵守HIPAA等法规，因此需要一种合规的框架。

Method: 框架整合了ABAC用于细粒度PHI管理、混合PHI清理管道（结合正则表达式和BERT模型）以及不可变审计跟踪。

Result: 该框架能够动态执行合规策略，减少PHI泄露风险，并提供可验证的审计记录。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为Agentic AI系统在医疗领域的合规应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their
foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as
medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing
sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight.
However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks
such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This
work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that
enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy
enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1)
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid
PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to
minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Robo-Troj，一种针对基于LLM的任务规划器的多触发器后门攻击方法，旨在揭示其安全漏洞并推动安全机器人系统的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于LLM的任务规划器表现出色，但其安全性研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过开发Robo-Troj攻击方法，揭示潜在的安全风险。

Method: 开发了Robo-Troj，一种多触发器后门攻击方法，通过独特触发词（如“herical”）激活恶意行为（如厨房机器人切手）。同时提出了一种优化方法选择最有效的触发词。

Result: Robo-Troj成功展示了基于LLM的任务规划器的脆弱性，能够通过特定触发词激活恶意行为。

Conclusion: 通过揭示LLM任务规划器的安全漏洞，本文呼吁加强机器人系统的安全性研究。

Abstract: Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than
individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step
solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in
LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security
aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first
multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main
contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to
accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can
use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious
behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an
optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective.
Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to
promote the development of secured robot systems.

*Tomoki Mizuno,Kazuya Yabashi,Tsuyoshi Tasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过同时估计下一个视角（NV）和姿态，提高了零售机器人对简单形状产品的姿态估计成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的RGBD相机姿态估计方法在特征较少时精度下降，而传统数学模型方法难以估计有效的NV。

Method: 开发了一种新的姿态估计神经网络，同时估计NV，利用姿态估计与NV估计的关联性。

Result: 实验表明，NV估计使姿态估计成功率提高7.4个百分点至77.3%，机器人成功展示84.2%的产品。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了简单形状产品的姿态估计和展示效果。

Abstract: We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is
effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display
robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN)
based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly
decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current
view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based
methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects
have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the
pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate,
the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation
NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV
estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt
higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we
verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.

Abstract: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement
learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot
tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized
learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity
and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this
paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile
badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis
locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a
physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In
this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is
used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we
train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue
when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered
badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and
90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized
to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table
tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.

### [197] [Anatomy-constrained modelling of image-derived input functions in dynamic PET using multi-organ segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17114)
*Valentin Langer,Kartikay Tehlan,Thomas Wendler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多器官分割的方法，整合主动脉、门静脉、肺动脉和输尿管的图像衍生输入函数（IDIFs），以改进动态PET成像中的动力学建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IDIFs仅从主动脉获取，忽略了解剖变异和复杂血管贡献，限制了动力学分析的准确性。

Method: 利用高分辨率CT分割肝脏、肺、肾脏和膀胱，结合器官特异性血液供应来源，改进IDIFs建模。

Result: 在9名患者的动态[$^{18}$F]FDG PET数据中，肝脏和肺的均方误差（MSE）分别降低了13.39%和10.42%。

Conclusion: 多IDIFs方法有望提升解剖建模和动态PET成像的潜力，促进示踪动力学建模在临床中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate kinetic analysis of [$^{18}$F]FDG distribution in dynamic positron
emission tomography (PET) requires anatomically constrained modelling of
image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Traditionally, IDIFs are obtained from
the aorta, neglecting anatomical variations and complex vascular contributions.
This study proposes a multi-organ segmentation-based approach that integrates
IDIFs from the aorta, portal vein, pulmonary artery, and ureters. Using
high-resolution CT segmentations of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bladder, we
incorporate organ-specific blood supply sources to improve kinetic modelling.
Our method was evaluated on dynamic [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data from nine patients,
resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of $13.39\%$ for the liver
and $10.42\%$ for the lungs. These initial results highlight the potential of
multiple IDIFs in improving anatomical modelling and fully leveraging dynamic
PET imaging. This approach could facilitate the integration of tracer kinetic
modelling into clinical routine.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INRs）的个性化动力学参数估计方法，用于动态PET成像，解决了传统方法计算量大和数据需求高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态PET成像中，基于两组织室模型的动力学参数估计计算量大且空间分辨率有限，而深度神经网络（DNNs）需要大量训练数据和计算资源。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示（INRs）学习连续函数，结合3D CT基础模型的解剖先验，实现高效、高分辨率的参数成像。

Result: 在[$^{18}$F]FDG动态PET/CT数据集上验证，相比现有DNNs方法，具有更高的空间分辨率、更低的均方误差和更好的解剖一致性。

Conclusion: INRs为个性化、数据高效的示踪动力学建模提供了潜力，适用于肿瘤表征、分割和预后评估。

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with [$^{18}$F]FDG enables
non-invasive quantification of glucose metabolism through kinetic analysis,
often modelled by the two-tissue compartment model (TCKM). However, voxel-wise
kinetic parameter estimation using conventional methods is computationally
intensive and limited by spatial resolution. Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer
an alternative but require large training datasets and significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a
physiological neural representation based on implicit neural representations
(INRs) for personalized kinetic parameter estimation. INRs, which learn
continuous functions, allow for efficient, high-resolution parametric imaging
with reduced data requirements. Our method also integrates anatomical priors
from a 3D CT foundation model to enhance robustness and precision in kinetic
modelling. We evaluate our approach on an [$^{18}$F]FDG dynamic PET/CT dataset
and compare it to state-of-the-art DNNs. Results demonstrate superior spatial
resolution, lower mean-squared error, and improved anatomical consistency,
particularly in tumour and highly vascularized regions. Our findings highlight
the potential of INRs for personalized, data-efficient tracer kinetic
modelling, enabling applications in tumour characterization, segmentation, and
prognostic assessment.

Abstract: Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for
thermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in
various pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for
observing sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in
vitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time,
non-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional
(3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a
sliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and
architectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed
network enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data
captured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle
variations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes,
have been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for
normal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for
quantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual
variability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing
dermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation
and bromhidrosis treatment.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的替代模型框架，用于快速预测粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积在多物理现象中至关重要，但传统数值方法（如边界元法）计算成本高，限制了其在多查询场景中的应用。

Method: 使用多种机器学习算法训练预计算数据集，输入为载荷和粗糙度参数，输出为有效接触面积，并进行超参数优化比较。

Result: 核岭回归器在准确性和效率上表现最佳，高斯过程回归器适用于不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法在多查询任务中实用高效，核岭回归器具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in
multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical
conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element
Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational
cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty
quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where
many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate
modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using
fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms
are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and
statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective
contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair
comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,
evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel
Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and
minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose
surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive
alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs
additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization
capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation
scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database
generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process.
Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query
tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the
energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development
still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics
tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face
significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures
that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative
algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small
molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we
introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to
generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat
unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer
connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855
DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized
molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar
chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark
our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse
conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its
performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given
these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level
structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for
predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for
their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a
powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of
various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex
nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and
effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable
contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of
contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex
optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the
assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of
NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges
due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge
this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal
neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming
only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational
perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the
state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales
up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic
linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we
further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics
from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful
synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear
examples.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in
ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive
Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric
measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to
the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of
atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the
performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space
Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel
data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision
for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid
wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed
simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO
simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront
sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic
noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to
develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and
closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried
parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few
millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms
r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby
demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument
control.

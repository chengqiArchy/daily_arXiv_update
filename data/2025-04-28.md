### [1] [Optimism, Expectation, or Sarcasm? Multi-Class Hope Speech Detection in Spanish and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17974)
*Sabur Butt,Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi,Ahmad Imam Amjad,Maaz Amjad,Hector G. Ceballos,Salud Maria Jimenez-Zafra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了PolyHope V2，一个多语言、细粒度的希望语音数据集，包含30,000多条标注的英语和西班牙语推文，区分了四种希望子类型（广义、现实、不现实和讽刺）。研究比较了预训练Transformer模型与大型语言模型（如GPT-4和Llama 3）的性能，发现微调的Transformer在区分细微希望类别和讽刺方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望是一种复杂且未被充分探索的情感状态，在教育、心理健康和社交互动中起重要作用。其表现形式多样，从现实的乐观到夸张的愿望或讽刺，使得自然语言处理系统难以准确检测。

Method: 研究构建了PolyHope V2数据集，包含30,000多条英语和西班牙语推文，标注了四种希望子类型。通过微调预训练Transformer模型，并与大型语言模型（如GPT-4和Llama 3）在零样本和少样本设置下进行比较。

Result: 微调的Transformer模型在区分细微希望类别和讽刺方面优于基于提示的大型语言模型。定性分析和混淆矩阵揭示了区分相关希望子类型的系统性挑战。

Conclusion: PolyHope V2数据集和研究结果为未来需要更高语义和上下文敏感性的跨语言情感识别任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant
role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic
emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to
exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language
Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a
multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated
tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope
subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances
existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark
multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes.
Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs,
especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through
qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges
in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a
robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater
semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.

### [2] [Improving LLM Personas via Rationalization with Psychological Scaffolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17993)
*Brihi Joshi,Xiang Ren,Swabha Swayamdipta,Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PB&J框架通过引入心理学理论生成的用户判断理由，改进了LLM人物模型，使其在预测用户偏好时表现优于仅基于人口统计或历史判断的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人物模型仅依赖用户的人口统计或历史判断，无法捕捉其判断背后的深层原因，限制了模型的预测能力。

Method: PB&J框架结合心理学理论（如大五人格和原始世界信念），生成用户判断的理由，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在公共意见和电影偏好预测任务中，PB&J框架的表现优于传统方法，且基于信念的模型与人工撰写的理由表现相当。

Conclusion: PB&J框架通过引入心理学理论生成的用户判断理由，显著提升了LLM人物模型的预测能力。

Abstract: Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a
user's preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas
-- based solely on a user's demographic attributes and/or prior judgments --
fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments. We
introduce PB&J (Psychology of Behavior and Judgments), a framework that
improves LLM personas by incorporating rationales of why a user might make
specific judgments. These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about
a user's behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or
beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds -- structured frameworks
grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World
Beliefs -- that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments
on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM
personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently outperform methods using
only a user's demographics and/or judgments. Additionally, LLM personas
constructed using scaffolds describing user beliefs perform competitively with
those using human-written rationales.

### [3] [Memory Reviving, Continuing Learning and Beyond: Evaluation of Pre-trained Encoders and Decoders for Multimodal Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18012)
*Zhuang Yu,Shiliang Sun,Jing Zhao,Tengfei Song,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练编码器和解码器在多模态机器翻译（MMT）中的作用，发现预训练解码器能显著提升翻译质量，而预训练编码器的效果则取决于视觉-文本对齐的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言和视觉模型在多模态机器翻译中的有效性及其作用，填补该领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过系统研究不同训练策略（从零开始训练到使用预训练和部分冻结组件）对翻译性能的影响，并在Multi30K和CoMMuTE数据集上进行实验。

Result: 预训练在多模态环境中起关键但不对称作用：预训练解码器能生成更流畅准确的输出，而预训练编码器的效果因视觉-文本对齐质量而异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预训练组件与模态融合的相互作用，为未来多模态翻译系统的架构设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) aims to improve translation quality by
leveraging auxiliary modalities such as images alongside textual input. While
recent advances in large-scale pre-trained language and vision models have
significantly benefited unimodal natural language processing tasks, their
effectiveness and role in MMT remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct a
systematic study on the impact of pre-trained encoders and decoders in
multimodal translation models. Specifically, we analyze how different training
strategies, from training from scratch to using pre-trained and partially
frozen components, affect translation performance under a unified MMT
framework. Experiments are carried out on the Multi30K and CoMMuTE dataset
across English-German and English-French translation tasks. Our results reveal
that pre-training plays a crucial yet asymmetrical role in multimodal settings:
pre-trained decoders consistently yield more fluent and accurate outputs, while
pre-trained encoders show varied effects depending on the quality of
visual-text alignment. Furthermore, we provide insights into the interplay
between modality fusion and pre-trained components, offering guidance for
future architecture design in multimodal translation systems.

### [4] [RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18041)
*Bang An,Shiyue Zhang,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，RAG框架可能降低LLMs的安全性，现有安全评估方法对RAG效果不佳，需针对性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG框架对LLMs安全性的影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 对11种LLMs进行RAG与非RAG框架的对比分析，评估现有安全方法的适用性。

Result: RAG可能降低模型安全性，安全文档与模型组合仍可能生成不安全内容，现有红队方法效果较差。

Conclusion: 需开发专门针对RAG LLMs的安全研究和红队方法。

Abstract: Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety
fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use
of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses
on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a
model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and
non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe
and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find
that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe
generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG
settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG
settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming
methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DREAM的方法，通过多模态风险解耦和监督微调结合RLAIF，显著提升MLLMs的安全性，实验显示其安全性能优于GPT-4V。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因结合视觉和文本数据而引入新的安全挑战，需要系统性解耦风险以增强模型的安全意识。

Method: 提出DREAM方法，通过多模态风险解耦、监督微调和迭代的RLAIF增强MLLMs的安全对齐。

Result: DREAM在推理和训练阶段显著提升安全性，SIUO安全&有效分数比GPT-4V提高16.17%，且不影响正常任务性能。

Conclusion: DREAM通过系统性风险解耦和优化方法，为MLLMs的安全对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to
their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new
dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper,
we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through
step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic
multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of
MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk
disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM}
(\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety
\textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety
alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM
significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without
compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a
16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V. The
data and code are available at https://github.com/Kizna1ver/DREAM.

### [6] [Exploring Personality-Aware Interactions in Salesperson Dialogue Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18058)
*Sijia Cheng,Wen-Yu Chang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于MBTI人格类型的用户对销售对话代理交互质量的影响，发现显著的模式，并开发了通用用户模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同人格类型用户如何影响销售对话代理的交互质量和性能，以提升系统的适应性和个性化能力。

Method: 通过大规模测试和分析，评估预训练代理在不同MBTI人格类型用户中的效果、适应性和个性化能力。

Result: 揭示了交互动态、任务完成率和对话自然度的显著模式，开发了通用的用户模拟器。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更具适应性和用户中心的对话系统提供了实用见解，并推动了跨领域个性化对话系统的发展。

Abstract: The integration of dialogue agents into the sales domain requires a deep
understanding of how these systems interact with users possessing diverse
personas. This study explores the influence of user personas, defined using the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), on the interaction quality and performance
of sales-oriented dialogue agents. Through large-scale testing and analysis, we
assess the pre-trained agent's effectiveness, adaptability, and personalization
capabilities across a wide range of MBTI-defined user types. Our findings
reveal significant patterns in interaction dynamics, task completion rates, and
dialogue naturalness, underscoring the future potential for dialogue agents to
refine their strategies to better align with varying personality traits. This
work not only provides actionable insights for building more adaptive and
user-centric conversational systems in the sales domain but also contributes
broadly to the field by releasing persona-defined user simulators. These
simulators, unconstrained by domain, offer valuable tools for future research
and demonstrate the potential for scaling personalized dialogue systems across
diverse applications.

### [7] [PropRAG: Guiding Retrieval with Beam Search over Proposition Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18070)
*Jingjin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PropRAG是一种基于上下文丰富命题和新型束搜索算法的框架，用于显式发现多步推理链，避免了在线LLM推理成本，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG方法无法捕捉人类记忆的关联性和上下文理解能力，而现有的结构化RAG方法（如HippoRAG）由于上下文丢失限制了保真度。PropRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PropRAG利用上下文丰富的命题和新型束搜索算法，通过高效图遍历和预计算嵌入进行在线检索，避免在线LLM推理，仅在离线阶段使用LLM进行命题提取和答案生成。

Result: PropRAG在PopQA（55.3%）、2Wiki（93.7%）、HotpotQA（97.0%）和MuSiQue（77.3%）上取得了零样本Recall@5的最优结果，并在MuSiQue上获得了52.4%的F1分数。

Conclusion: PropRAG通过更丰富的表示和显式的、无需LLM的在线路径搜索，改进了证据检索，推动了非参数持续学习的进展。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard non-parametric
approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting common in continual learning. However,
standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the
interconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning
(associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured
RAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples,
the inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework
leveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm
over proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains.
Crucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without
invoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and
pre-computed embeddings. This avoids online LLM inference costs and potential
inconsistencies during evidence gathering. LLMs are used effectively offline
for high-quality proposition extraction and post-retrieval for answer
generation. PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 results on
PopQA (55.3%), 2Wiki (93.7%), HotpotQA (97.0%), and MuSiQue (77.3%), alongside
top F1 scores (e.g., 52.4% on MuSiQue). By improving evidence retrieval through
richer representation and explicit, LLM-free online path finding, PropRAG
advances non-parametric continual learning.

### [8] [Stabilizing Reasoning in Medical LLMs with Continued Pretraining and Reasoning Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18080)
*Wataru Kawakami,Keita Suzuki,Junichiro Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B，一个针对日本医学领域优化的72B参数模型，通过两阶段微调实现高准确性和稳定推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域潜力巨大，但临床采用受限于事实准确性、语言限制（如日语）和推理解释的可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段微调：1）在日语医学语料库上持续预训练（CPT）；2）通过推理偏好优化（RPO）增强可靠推理路径生成。

Result: 在日本医学执照考试基准（IgakuQA）上达到0.868准确率，优于GPT-4o（0.866），且在需要解释时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 优化可靠解释与准确性同等重要，RPO有效稳定推理生成，模型权重已公开以促进可信LLM研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical
adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific
limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required
to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper
introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the
Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We
employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first,
Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills
deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a
preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways
while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical
Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves
state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary
models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which
exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively
on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high
accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in
stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of
optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the
Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy
LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

*Muhammad Mubashar,Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal,Fabio Cuzzolin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RSLLM的新方法，用于量化大型语言模型（LLM）生成文本的不确定性。该方法通过预测有限随机集（信念函数）而非传统概率向量，并结合层次聚类方法提高效率，在CoQA和OBQA数据集上表现优于标准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM生成文本的可信度问题，提出一种能够量化不确定性的方法，以提升模型生成内容的可靠性。

Method: 提出RSLLM方法，预测有限随机集（信念函数），并通过层次聚类提取关键子集以提高效率。

Result: 在CoQA和OBQA数据集上，RSLLM在答案正确性和不确定性估计方面优于标准模型，并能检测幻觉现象。

Conclusion: RSLLM方法有效提升了LLM生成文本的可靠性，并在不确定性量化和幻觉检测方面表现出潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and
responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In
this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We
propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts
finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than
probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we
also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use
a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is
defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the
method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced
in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via
the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The
proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b,
Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in
both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in
estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the
capability to detect when its hallucinating.

*Yinglong Yu,Hao Shen,Zhengyi Lyu,Qi He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示调优的事实核查价值估计分类方法，通过设计提示模板和大语言模型结合，提升了在有限或无标签数据下的准确性，实验表明其优于或匹配多种基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对全球化和信息化背景下日益严重的错误信息问题，研究旨在提高事实核查价值估计的准确性。

Method: 采用提示调优技术，设计提示模板应用于大语言模型，实现上下文学习，优化事实核查价值估计。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验显示，该方法在F1分数和准确率等指标上优于或匹配BERT、GPT-3.5和GPT-4等基线模型。

Conclusion: 基于提示调优的方法在事实核查价值估计任务中表现出有效性和先进性。

Abstract: In response to the growing problem of misinformation in the context of
globalization and informatization, this paper proposes a classification method
for fact-check-worthiness estimation based on prompt tuning. We construct a
model for fact-check-worthiness estimation at the methodological level using
prompt tuning. By applying designed prompt templates to large language models,
we establish in-context learning and leverage prompt tuning technology to
improve the accuracy of determining whether claims have fact-check-worthiness,
particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Through extensive
experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses or matches multiple baseline methods in the classification task of
fact-check-worthiness estimation assessment, including classical pre-trained
models such as BERT, as well as recent popular large models like GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4. Experiments show that the prompt tuning-based method proposed in this
study exhibits certain advantages in evaluation metrics such as F1 score and
accuracy, thereby effectively validating its effectiveness and advancement in
the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation.

Motivation: 研究中英文媒体在报道巴黎奥运会时的话语构建和态度差异，揭示不同文化背景下的报道特点。

Method: 使用主题建模、大语言模型（LLM）提示工程和语料库短语学方法分析媒体文本。

Result: 中文媒体关注具体运动项目、体育精神、兴奋剂争议和新技术，英文媒体关注女性运动员、奖牌争夺和资格争议。中文报道在开幕式和体育精神描述中更频繁使用介词共现和积极语义韵，英文报道在女性运动员报道中表现积极语义韵，但在开幕式反应预测和女子拳击争议中表现消极语义韵。

Conclusion: 中英文媒体在报道巴黎奥运会时展现出显著的话语和态度差异，反映了文化和社会背景的影响。

Abstract: This study analyzes Chinese and English media reports on the Paris Olympics
using topic modeling, Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering, and corpus
phraseology methods to explore similarities and differences in discourse
construction and attitudinal meanings. Common topics include the opening
ceremony, athlete performance, and sponsorship brands. Chinese media focus on
specific sports, sports spirit, doping controversies, and new technologies,
while English media focus on female athletes, medal wins, and eligibility
controversies. Chinese reports show more frequent prepositional co-occurrences
and positive semantic prosody in describing the opening ceremony and sports
spirit. English reports exhibit positive semantic prosody when covering female
athletes but negative prosody in predicting opening ceremony reactions and
discussing women's boxing controversies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证评估揭示了当前幻觉评估指标的不足，并提出LLM（如GPT-4）为基础的评估方法效果最佳，同时模式寻求解码方法可减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的幻觉问题阻碍了其可靠性和广泛应用，但现有评估指标的鲁棒性和泛化能力尚未得到验证。

Method: 对6组幻觉检测指标在4个数据集、37个语言模型和5种解码方法上进行大规模评估。

Result: 发现当前指标与人类判断不一致、问题视角狭隘且参数扩展效果不一致；LLM（如GPT-4）评估效果最佳，模式寻求解码方法减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的指标和策略以理解和减少幻觉。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread
adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a
persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been
proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and
generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a
large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection
metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding
methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current
hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments,
take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with
parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with
GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem
to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These
findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify
hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的临床语言模型预训练目标，通过时间顺序的句子对训练模型，以提升其在临床推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将电子健康记录视为静态文档，忽略了其时间演化和因果关联特性。

Method: 设计了一种时间蕴含预训练目标，将EHR片段作为时间顺序句子对，训练模型判断后续状态是否蕴含、矛盾或中立。

Result: 在MIMIC IV数据集上预训练后，模型在时间临床QA、早期预警预测和疾病进展建模任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 时间结构化的预训练任务能提升模型在临床推理任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks
by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and
medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a
static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined
nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal
entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain.
Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and
trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by,
contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this
temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical
reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting
and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and
demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning
prediction, and disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a pivotal role in various Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks by identifying and classifying named entities
(NEs) from unstructured data into predefined categories such as person,
organization, location, date, and time. While extensive research exists for
high-resource languages and general domains, NER in Urdu particularly within
domain-specific contexts like education remains significantly underexplored.
This is Due to lack of annotated datasets for educational content which limits
the ability of existing models to accurately identify entities such as academic
roles, course names, and institutional terms, underscoring the urgent need for
targeted resources in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, no dataset
exists in the domain of the Urdu language for this purpose. To achieve this
objective this study makes three key contributions. Firstly, we created a
manually annotated dataset in the education domain, named EDU-NER-2025, which
contains 13 unique most important entities related to education domain. Second,
we describe our annotation process and guidelines in detail and discuss the
challenges of labelling EDU-NER-2025 dataset. Third, we addressed and analyzed
key linguistic challenges, such as morphological complexity and ambiguity,
which are prevalent in formal Urdu texts.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了偏好训练技术（如RLHF和DPO）在提升冰岛法律摘要生成中的表现，发现偏好训练提高了法律准确性，但对语言质量提升不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律领域语言模型的整合潜力巨大，但法律文本的术语和语言风格带来挑战，需探索偏好训练是否能提升模型表现。

Method: 比较偏好训练（RLHF和DPO）与传统监督学习在冰岛法律摘要生成中的效果。

Result: 偏好训练提高了法律准确性，但对冰岛语言质量无显著改善；自动指标与人工评估存在差异。

Conclusion: 偏好训练在法律领域有效，但需结合定性评估以全面优化模型表现。

Abstract: The integration of language models in the legal domain holds considerable
promise for streamlining processes and improving efficiency in managing
extensive workloads. However, the specialized terminology, nuanced language,
and formal style of legal texts can present substantial challenges. This study
examines whether preference-based training techniques, specifically
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization,
can enhance models' performance in generating Icelandic legal summaries that
align with domain-specific language standards and user preferences. We compare
models fine-tuned with preference training to those using conventional
supervised learning. Results indicate that preference training improves the
legal accuracy of generated summaries over standard fine-tuning but does not
significantly enhance the overall quality of Icelandic language usage.
Discrepancies between automated metrics and human evaluations further
underscore the importance of qualitative assessment in developing language
models for the legal domain.

Conclusion: 这些模型因其小规模和易部署性，为生成式AI开辟了新应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce a new generation of small reasoning models for RAG, search, and
source summarization. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a
large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of
multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support
for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple
features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query
reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B

Abstract: Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before
they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across
various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on
multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate
reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This
discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single
forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a
multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that
overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom
attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach
significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on
multi-turn reasoning datasets.

Motivation: 自动化结构化临床访谈可改善心理健康服务的可及性，但现有LLM方法未能符合精神病学诊断协议。

Method: MAGI通过四个专门智能体（导航、提问、判断、诊断）动态处理MINI的临床逻辑，生成可解释的PsyCoT追踪。

Result: 在1002名真实参与者中测试，涵盖抑郁、焦虑和自杀倾向，MAGI展现了临床严谨性和适应性。

Conclusion: MAGI为LLM辅助心理健康评估提供了临床严谨、适应性强且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental
healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches
fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first
framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated
multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four
specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to
the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending
diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating
whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent
generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map
symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world
participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and
suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by
combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable
reasoning.

Motivation: 解决图像生成模型中实体知识记忆不足的问题，因实体数量庞大且持续涌现。

Method: 提出TextTIGER，利用LLM增强和总结实体描述，减少长输入对性能的影响。

Result: 在IS、FID和CLIPScore等指标上表现优于仅使用标题提示的方法，且总结的描述更丰富。

Conclusion: 通过优化实体相关描述，显著提升图像生成能力。

Abstract: Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models
to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully
memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and
their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent
Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge
on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented
descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance
degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub
(WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset
comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image
generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation
performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to
caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms
that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability
to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that
refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions
enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available
upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的幻觉问题（输出错误信息）是其主要挑战之一，需准确评估和量化其不确定性。传统模型的UQ方法虽部分适用于LLMs，但缺乏对其有效性的深入分析和比较基准。

Method: 通过系统综述代表性UQ和校准方法，并引入严格基准，使用两个广泛使用的可靠性数据集对六种相关方法进行实证评估。

Result: 实证评估验证了综述的重要发现，并提供了未来研究方向和开放挑战的展望。

Conclusion: 该研究是首个专门综述LLMs校准方法和相关指标的论文，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains.
However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information --
remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how
to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature
on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure
uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment
between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted
for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and
does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among
existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of
representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a
rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically
evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our
review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open
challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated
study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

Conclusion: Auto-SLURP为多智能体框架的评估提供了重要工具，推动了相关技术的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models

aimed at evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks in the context of
intelligent personal assistants. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset
-- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by
relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services.
This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline,
covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our
experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for
current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and
intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remain a work in progress. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLI系统依赖监督学习，但数据集存在标注偏差和伪影，限制了泛化能力和实际应用。

Method: 采用强化学习（GRPO）进行CoT学习，结合参数高效技术（LoRA和QLoRA）微调7B、14B和32B语言模型。

Result: 32B AWQ量化模型在11个对抗性测试集中7个（或全部）超越现有最优结果，内存占用仅22GB。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建无需牺牲推理质量的鲁棒NLI系统提供了可扩展且实用的框架。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language
understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and
information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely
on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts
and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work,
we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the
need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more
challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language
models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating
strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B
AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11
adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our
replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust
reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a
scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without
sacrificing inference quality.

Conclusion: Bohairic Coptic是一种与Sahidic相关但独特的方言，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in digital resources for other Coptic dialects,
especially Sahidic, Bohairic Coptic, the main Coptic dialect for pre-Mamluk,
late Byzantine Egypt, and the contemporary language of the Coptic Church,
remains critically under-resourced. This paper presents and evaluates the first
syntactically annotated corpus of Bohairic Coptic, sampling data from a range
of works, including Biblical text, saints' lives and Christian ascetic writing.
We also explore some of the main differences we observe compared to the
existing UD treebank of Sahidic Coptic, the classical dialect of the language,
and conduct joint and cross-dialect parsing experiments, revealing the unique
nature of Bohairic as a related, but distinct variety from the more often
studied Sahidic.

TL;DR: 论文提出了HRScene，一个用于评估高分辨率图像（HRI）理解能力的统一基准，包含25个真实数据集和2个合成诊断数据集，揭示了当前视觉大语言模型（VLMs）在HRI理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个全面的基准来评估视觉大语言模型（VLMs）在高分辨率图像（HRI）理解上的表现，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过整合25个真实数据集和2个合成诊断数据集，构建HRScene基准，并利用28种VLMs进行实验评估。

Result: 实验显示，当前VLMs在真实任务中的平均准确率约为50%，且在合成数据集上表现出区域利用不足的问题。

Conclusion: HRScene揭示了VLMs在HRI理解上的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: High-resolution image (HRI) understanding aims to process images with a large
number of pixels, such as pathological images and agricultural aerial images,
both of which can exceed 1 million pixels. Vision Large Language Models (VLMs)
can allegedly handle HRIs, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive
benchmark for VLMs to evaluate HRI understanding. To address this gap, we
introduce HRScene, a novel unified benchmark for HRI understanding with rich
scenes. HRScene incorporates 25 real-world datasets and 2 synthetic diagnostic
datasets with resolutions ranging from 1,024 $\times$ 1,024 to 35,503 $\times$
26,627. HRScene is collected and re-annotated by 10 graduate-level annotators,
covering 25 scenarios, ranging from microscopic to radiology images, street
views, long-range pictures, and telescope images. It includes HRIs of
real-world objects, scanned documents, and composite multi-image. The two
diagnostic evaluation datasets are synthesized by combining the target image
with the gold answer and distracting images in different orders, assessing how
well models utilize regions in HRI. We conduct extensive experiments involving
28 VLMs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o. Experiments on HRScene show
that current VLMs achieve an average accuracy of around 50% on real-world
tasks, revealing significant gaps in HRI understanding. Results on synthetic
datasets reveal that VLMs struggle to effectively utilize HRI regions, showing
significant Regional Divergence and lost-in-middle, shedding light on future
research.

<details>

Motivation: 研究LLM替代心理治疗师的可行性，因科技初创企业和研究领域对此有推广。

Method: 通过映射主流医疗机构使用的治疗指南，评估LLM在治疗关系中的表现，并实验测试LLM（如GPT-4）的回应能力。

Result: LLM表现出对心理健康问题的偏见，且在自然治疗环境中对关键情况回应不当，如鼓励妄想思维。

Conclusion: LLM不应替代治疗师，但可探讨其在临床治疗中的其他辅助角色。

Abstract: Should a large language model (LLM) be used as a therapist? In this paper, we
investigate the use of LLMs to *replace* mental health providers, a use case
promoted in the tech startup and research space. We conduct a mapping review of
therapy guides used by major medical institutions to identify crucial aspects
of therapeutic relationships, such as the importance of a therapeutic alliance
between therapist and client. We then assess the ability of LLMs to reproduce
and adhere to these aspects of therapeutic relationships by conducting several
experiments investigating the responses of current LLMs, such as `gpt-4o`.
Contrary to best practices in the medical community, LLMs 1) express stigma
toward those with mental health conditions and 2) respond inappropriately to
certain common (and critical) conditions in naturalistic therapy settings --
e.g., LLMs encourage clients' delusional thinking, likely due to their
sycophancy. This occurs even with larger and newer LLMs, indicating that
current safety practices may not address these gaps. Furthermore, we note
foundational and practical barriers to the adoption of LLMs as therapists, such
as that a therapeutic alliance requires human characteristics (e.g., identity
and stakes). For these reasons, we conclude that LLMs should not replace
therapists, and we discuss alternative roles for LLMs in clinical therapy.

Motivation: 解决1-bit LLMs中激活异常值导致的低比特量化困难问题。

Method: 提出H-BitLinear模块，应用在线Hadamard变换平滑激活分布，使其更适合低比特表示。

Result: BitNet v2在8-bit激活下性能与BitNet b1.58相当，4-bit激活下性能损失极小。

Conclusion: BitNet v2为高效部署1-bit LLMs提供了可行的低比特量化方案。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by
activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We
introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation
quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward
network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online
Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation
smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable
for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch
with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2
achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit
activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for
batched inference.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在多语言数学推理方面存在性能差异和语言一致性低的问题，PolyMath旨在提供一个全面评估工具以揭示这些挑战。

Method: 通过构建涵盖多语言和多难度级别的数学推理基准测试，并对高级LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 测试显示，即使是顶级LLMs（如Deepseek-R1-671B和Qwen-QwQ-32B）在最高难度级别下准确率低于30%，且性能因语言差异显著。

Conclusion: 控制输出语言可能影响推理性能，尤其是低资源语言，这为提升LLMs的多语言能力提供了方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning
benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our
benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and
high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual
mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and
Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30%
accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark
reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning
performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output
language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with
performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for
current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language
in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance,
especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction
for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

Result: 在七个推理基准测试中，FAST相对基础模型提升10%准确率，同时减少32.7-67.3%的token使用。

Conclusion: FAST框架有效平衡推理长度与准确性，为大型视觉语言模型的高效推理提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have revealed an

across all tasks regardless of questions. To address this issue, we present
\textbf{FAST}, a novel \textbf{Fa}st-\textbf{S}low \textbf{T}hinking framework
that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics.
Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking
in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect
performance. We develop FAST-GRPO with three components: model-based metrics
for question characterization, an adaptive thinking reward mechanism, and
difficulty-aware KL regularization. Experiments across seven reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over
10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token
usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively
balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

Conclusion: 本文的方法推动了对话理解和系统开发的先进水平，为SSI研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, Slot Schema Induction (SSI) is
essential for automatically identifying key information slots from dialogue
data without manual intervention. This paper presents a novel state-of-the-art
(SoTA) approach that formulates SSI as a text generation task, where a language
model incrementally constructs and refines a slot schema over a stream of
dialogue data. To develop this approach, we present a fully automatic LLM-based
TOD simulation method that creates data with high-quality state labels for
novel task domains. Furthermore, we identify issues in SSI evaluation due to
data leakage and poor metric alignment with human judgment. We resolve these by
creating new evaluation data using our simulation method with human guidance
and correction, as well as designing improved evaluation metrics. These
contributions establish a foundation for future SSI research and advance the
SoTA in dialogue understanding and system development.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在共同构建解释对话中的能力，发现LLMs能展示一些促进理解的行为，但其监控和调整解释的能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能作为解释者在动态对话中适应解释对象的背景和需求，提升解释的可理解性。

Method: 通过用户研究，让解释对象与LLMs互动，评估LLMs的共同构建解释行为及其对理解的影响。

Result: LLMs能展示如验证问题等共同构建行为，促进理解，但其监控和调整解释的能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在共同构建解释对话中表现有限，需进一步改进以适应动态解释需求。

Abstract: The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the
quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding
depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on
co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously
monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We
investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers
in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user
study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been
instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the
explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their
perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that
current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification
questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding
of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current
understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

*Gwen Yidou Weng,Benjie Wang,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新型框架，通过概率推理和轻量级控制高效计算预期属性概率（EAP），以控制语言模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在控制语言模型输出时存在效率低、灵活性差的问题，需要一种更高效、灵活的方法。

Method: TRACE通过从语言模型中提取隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）并结合小型分类器，精确计算EAP，并调整下一个标记的概率。

Result: TRACE在解毒任务中表现优异，仅增加10%的解码开销，并能快速适应76个低资源个性化模型。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种高效、灵活的方法来控制语言模型输出，适用于多种属性任务。

Abstract: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to
control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or
desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive
models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that
require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for
each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected
Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which
is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable
Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel
framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through
tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to
estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's
predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token
probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves
state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead,
adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly
extends to composite attributes.

*Ayesha Siddique,Khurram Khalil,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: XAIedge框架通过近似计算技术优化XAI算法，提升实时场景下的能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI硬件加速方法在实时场景中能效不足，限制了其应用。

Method: XAIedge将XAI算法转化为近似矩阵计算，结合卷积、傅里叶变换和近似计算范式，实现TPU边缘设备的高效加速。

Result: XAIedge能效提升2倍，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: XAIedge有望推动可解释AI在能源受限实时应用中的部署。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enhances AI system transparency by
framing interpretability as an optimization problem. However, this approach
often necessitates numerous iterations of computationally intensive operations,
limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. While recent research has
focused on XAI hardware acceleration on FPGAs and TPU, these methods do not
fully address energy efficiency in real-time settings. To address this
limitation, we propose XAIedge, a novel framework that leverages approximate
computing techniques into XAI algorithms, including integrated gradients, model
distillation, and Shapley analysis. XAIedge translates these algorithms into
approximate matrix computations and exploits the synergy between convolution,
Fourier transform, and approximate computing paradigms. This approach enables
efficient hardware acceleration on TPU-based edge devices, facilitating faster
real-time outcome interpretations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates
that XAIedge achieves a $2\times$ improvement in energy efficiency compared to
existing accurate XAI hardware acceleration techniques while maintaining
comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of XAIedge to
significantly advance the deployment of explainable AI in energy-constrained
real-time applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PharmaSwarm是一个多智能体框架，通过协调专业化的LLM代理来提出、验证和优化药物靶点和先导化合物的假设，以加速药物发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现面临高失败率和高成本的问题，且数据流分散，缺乏统一的机制洞察。现有的大语言模型缺乏模块化专业化和迭代记忆能力。

Method: PharmaSwarm通过多个专业化LLM代理（如基因组分析、知识图谱、通路富集等）协作，并由中央评估LLM持续排名假设。系统具有共享记忆层，支持自改进。

Result: PharmaSwarm支持多种药物发现场景（如文献驱动、组学引导、市场驱动的再利用），并通过四层验证管道确保透明度和可重复性。

Conclusion: PharmaSwarm作为AI助手，能比传统流程更高效地加速转化研究并提供高可信假设。

Abstract: Drug discovery remains a formidable challenge: more than 90 percent of
candidate molecules fail in clinical evaluation, and development costs often
exceed one billion dollars per approved therapy. Disparate data streams, from
genomics and transcriptomics to chemical libraries and clinical records, hinder
coherent mechanistic insight and slow progress. Meanwhile, large language
models excel at reasoning and tool integration but lack the modular
specialization and iterative memory required for regulated, hypothesis-driven
workflows. We introduce PharmaSwarm, a unified multi-agent framework that
orchestrates specialized LLM "agents" to propose, validate, and refine
hypotheses for novel drug targets and lead compounds. Each agent accesses
dedicated functionality--automated genomic and expression analysis; a curated
biomedical knowledge graph; pathway enrichment and network simulation;
interpretable binding affinity prediction--while a central Evaluator LLM
continuously ranks proposals by biological plausibility, novelty, in silico
efficacy, and safety. A shared memory layer captures validated insights and
fine-tunes underlying submodels over time, yielding a self-improving system.
Deployable on low-code platforms or Kubernetes-based microservices, PharmaSwarm
supports literature-driven discovery, omics-guided target identification, and
market-informed repurposing. We also describe a rigorous four-tier validation
pipeline spanning retrospective benchmarking, independent computational assays,
experimental testing, and expert user studies to ensure transparency,
reproducibility, and real-world impact. By acting as an AI copilot, PharmaSwarm
can accelerate translational research and deliver high-confidence hypotheses
more efficiently than traditional pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗系统的数字化，患者数据的隐私保护变得至关重要，同时机器学习在医疗领域的广泛应用需要解决隐私泄露的风险。

Method: 采用差分隐私和联邦学习技术，前者通过添加噪声保护数据隐私，后者支持在分散数据集上协作训练模型。

Result: 在心脏病数据上的实验表明，结合差分隐私的联邦学习模型实现了85%的测试准确率，同时确保了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 研究表明，差分隐私和联邦学习能有效平衡医疗数据的隐私保护与机器学习分析的实用性。

Abstract: With the rapid digitalization of healthcare systems, there has been a
substantial increase in the generation and sharing of private health data.
Safeguarding patient information is essential for maintaining consumer trust
and ensuring compliance with legal data protection regulations. Machine
learning is critical in healthcare, supporting personalized treatment, early
disease detection, predictive analytics, image interpretation, drug discovery,
efficient operations, and patient monitoring. It enhances decision-making,
accelerates research, reduces errors, and improves patient outcomes. In this
paper, we utilize machine learning methodologies, including differential
privacy and federated learning, to develop privacy-preserving models that
enable healthcare stakeholders to extract insights without compromising
individual privacy. Differential privacy introduces noise to data to guarantee
statistical privacy, while federated learning enables collaborative model
training across decentralized datasets. We explore applying these technologies
to Heart Disease Data, demonstrating how they preserve privacy while delivering
valuable insights and comprehensive analysis. Our results show that using a
federated learning model with differential privacy achieved a test accuracy of
85%, ensuring patient data remained secure and private throughout the process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiMind是一个将多模态信息（如面部表情和语音语调）与心理理论（ToM）模型结合的大型语言模型（LLM）代理框架，用于提升社交推理游戏（如狼人杀）中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在社交推理游戏中仅依赖文本信息，忽略了人类自然使用的多模态线索（如面部表情和语调），且缺乏对其他玩家心理状态的建模。

Method: 使用One Night Ultimate Werewolf作为测试平台，MultiMind整合多模态信息，结合ToM模型和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），优化沟通策略以减少自身嫌疑。

Result: 在代理对代理模拟和人类玩家研究中，MultiMind表现出卓越的游戏表现。

Conclusion: MultiMind是LLM代理在多模态社交推理领域的重要进展，使其更接近人类社交推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and
social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to
textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial
expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate.
Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players'
identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players.
To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a
testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal
information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal
tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to
represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM
model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication
strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive
evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human
players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work
presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like
social reasoning across multimodal domains.

*Xiang Li,Haixu Ma,Guanyong Wu,Shi Mu,Chen Li,Shunpan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨模态药物编码器（MKMed）框架，通过整合多种知识模态解决药物推荐中的“桶效应”问题，显著提升了推荐准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物推荐中不同药物知识数据的不平衡（如仅文本描述或结构化数据）限制了模型性能，称为“桶效应”。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 首先预训练一个跨模态编码器，通过对比学习对齐五种知识模态；然后将多知识药物表示与患者记录结合进行推荐。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上的实验表明，MKMed有效缓解了“桶效应”，并在准确性和安全性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MKMed通过跨模态对齐和多知识整合，显著提升了药物推荐性能，为解决数据不平衡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is crucial in healthcare, offering effective
treatments based on patient's electronic health records (EHR). Previous studies
show that integrating more medication-related knowledge improves medication
representation accuracy. However, not all medications encompass multiple types
of knowledge data simultaneously. For instance, some medications provide only
textual descriptions without structured data. This imbalance in data
availability limits the performance of existing models, a challenge we term the
"bucket effect" in medication recommendation. Our data analysis uncovers the
severity of the "bucket effect" in medication recommendation. To fill this gap,
we introduce a cross-modal medication encoder capable of seamlessly aligning
data from different modalities and propose a medication recommendation
framework to integrate Multiple types of Knowledge, named MKMed. Specifically,
we first pre-train a cross-modal encoder with contrastive learning on five
knowledge modalities, aligning them into a unified space. Then, we combine the
multi-knowledge medication representations with patient records for
recommendations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets
demonstrate that MKMed mitigates the "bucket effect" in data, and significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy and safety.

Motivation: 为规划任务提供可验证的低界证书，以证明任务无解或计划最优性，增强结果的可靠性和透明度。

Method: 基于伪布尔约束的通用框架生成证书，并修改$A^{*}$算法以生成最优性证明，使用模式数据库启发式和$h^	extit{max}$作为具体示例。

Result: 展示了如何通过修改$A^{*}$算法生成最优性证明，且开销较小。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何启发式算法，只要其推理能高效表达为伪布尔约束，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can
be used to prove the unsolvability of a task or the optimality of a plan in a
way that can be verified by an independent third party. We describe a general
framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on pseudo-Boolean
constraints, which is agnostic to the planning algorithm used.
  As a case study, we show how to modify the $A^{*}$ algorithm to produce
proofs of optimality with modest overhead, using pattern database heuristics
and $h^\textit{max}$ as concrete examples. The same proof logging approach
works for any heuristic whose inferences can be efficiently expressed as
reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints.

Motivation: 当前放射学报告生成模型缺乏专家的结构化推理能力，导致临床信任和解释性不足。BoxMed-RL旨在通过连接视觉发现与解剖位置，提升报告的准确性和可信度。

Method: BoxMed-RL分为两个阶段：预训练阶段通过医学概念学习和强化学习对齐医学发现与边界框；下游适配器阶段冻结预训练权重，训练适配器生成流畅且可信的报告。

Result: 在公开数据集上，BoxMed-RL在METEOR和ROUGE-L指标上平均提升7%，在大型语言模型指标上提升5%。

Conclusion: BoxMed-RL通过模仿放射科医生的工作流程，显著提升了放射学报告的质量和解释性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation is critical for efficiency but current models
lack the structured reasoning of experts, hindering clinical trust and
explainability by failing to link visual findings to precise anatomical
locations. This paper introduces BoxMed-RL, a groundbreaking unified training
framework for generating spatially verifiable and explainable radiology
reports. Built on a large vision-language model, BoxMed-RL revolutionizes
report generation through two integrated phases: (1) In the Pretraining Phase,
we refine the model via medical concept learning, using Chain-of-Thought
supervision to internalize the radiologist-like workflow, followed by spatially
verifiable reinforcement, which applies reinforcement learning to align medical
findings with bounding boxes. (2) In the Downstream Adapter Phase, we freeze
the pretrained weights and train a downstream adapter to ensure fluent and
clinically credible reports. This framework precisely mimics radiologists'
workflow, compelling the model to connect high-level medical concepts with
definitive anatomical evidence. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that BoxMed-RL achieves an average 7% improvement in both METEOR
and ROUGE-L metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. An average 5%
improvement in large language model-based metrics further underscores
BoxMed-RL's robustness in generating high-quality radiology reports.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化监督成功概率的框架，分析了监督者与被监督者能力差异对监督效果的影响，并验证了嵌套可扩展监督（NSO）的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究可扩展监督（scalable oversight）的扩展性问题，即如何通过较弱AI系统监督更强AI系统，以控制未来超级智能系统。

Method: 提出一个框架，将监督建模为能力不匹配玩家之间的博弈，使用监督和欺骗相关的Elo分数量化监督成功概率，并通过Nim游戏和四种监督游戏验证框架。

Result: 发现监督成功概率随能力差异下降，嵌套监督（NSO）在监督强400 Elo点的系统时成功率低于52%。

Conclusion: 嵌套可扩展监督在监督极强系统时效果有限，需优化监督层级数以最大化成功概率。

Abstract: Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger
ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent
systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To
address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of
successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the
system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game
between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific and
deception-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their
general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and
task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game
Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: "Mafia", "Debate", "Backdoor
Code" and "Wargames". For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how
domain performance depends on general AI system capability (using Chatbot Arena
Elo as a proxy for general capability). We then build on our findings in a
theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which
trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted
models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and
derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of
oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. In our
numerical examples, the NSO success rate is below 52% when overseeing systems
that are 400 Elo points stronger than the baseline overseer, and it declines
further for overseeing even stronger systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI风险评估提供了系统性解决方案，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent
risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential
for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks.
Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions
about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at
assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect
risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic
risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques
from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new
challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying
potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting
evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities.
The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report
card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic
approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis
provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI
system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk
pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts
using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3)
Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and
explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or
limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods
by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for
critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI
developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶规划方法多为基于规则，难以应对复杂场景；传统RL方法因奖励设计复杂且批量增大时优化困难，限制了其扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种基于路线完成度的简单奖励设计，通过终止或惩罚违规行为来优化训练效果，并利用分布式数据并行扩展训练规模。

Result: 在CARLA和nuPlan数据集上，该方法显著优于其他RL方法，性能提升明显且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 简单直观的奖励设计结合大规模训练，能够有效提升自动驾驶规划的性能和扩展性。

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in
autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based,
but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is
scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning.
Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum
multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We
show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the
mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches.
Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single
intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by
terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find
that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple
reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes
enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to
300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The
resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark,
outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.
Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is
the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and
90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of
magnitude faster than prior work.

Abstract: This work presents an overview of the technical details behind a high

Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot.
This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end
reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code
publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available
through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean
Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on
hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures
as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from
Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality
reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight
phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple
Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces,
disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail
our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low
level API.

Result: 在VizDoom环境中，传统方法表现优于基于Transformer的方法。

Conclusion: 尽管Transformer在Atari游戏中表现良好，但在VizDoom环境中传统方法更优。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Transformer based architectures for
reinforcement learning in both online and offline settings within the Doom game
environment. Our investigation focuses on two primary approaches: Deep
Transformer Q- learning Networks (DTQN) for online learning and Decision
Transformers (DT) for offline reinforcement learning. DTQN leverages the
sequential modelling capabilities of Transformers to enhance Q-learning in
partially observable environments,while Decision Transformers repurpose
sequence modelling techniques to enable offline agents to learn from past
trajectories without direct interaction with the environment. We conclude that
while Transformers might have performed well in Atari games, more traditional
methods perform better than Transformer based method in both the settings in

Method: 系统比较了时域、频域和时频域EEG数据在深度神经网络中的表现，并通过统计测试确定最优数据表示和模型架构。

Result: 频域数据表现最佳，检测指标超过97%，为癫痫发作检测提供了更准确可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 频域数据是癫痫发作检测的最优选择，为未来自动化诊断系统提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Epilepsy, affecting approximately 50 million people globally, is
characterized by abnormal brain activity and remains challenging to treat. The
diagnosis of epilepsy relies heavily on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, where
specialists manually analyze epileptiform patterns across pre-ictal, ictal,
post-ictal, and interictal periods. However, the manual analysis of EEG signals
is prone to variability between experts, emphasizing the need for automated
solutions. Although previous studies have explored preprocessing techniques and
machine learning approaches for seizure detection, there is a gap in
understanding how the representation of EEG data (time, frequency, or
time-frequency domains) impacts the predictive performance of deep learning
models. This work addresses this gap by systematically comparing deep neural
networks trained on EEG data in these three domains. Through the use of
statistical tests, we identify the optimal data representation and model
architecture for epileptic seizure detection. The results demonstrate that
frequency-domain data achieves detection metrics exceeding 97\%, providing a
robust foundation for more accurate and reliable seizure detection systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CANet的新架构，用于解决长期时间序列预测中非平稳数据的挑战，通过结合风格迁移技术和自适应归一化模块，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列预测在现实应用中至关重要，但数据的非平稳性（如分布漂移和统计特性变化）导致传统模型性能受限。

Method: CANet采用非平稳自适应归一化模块（结合风格混合门和自适应实例归一化）、多分辨率分块和傅里叶分析自适应阈值技术，以及堆叠克罗内克积层。

Result: 在真实数据集上，CANet的MSE和MAE分别降低了42%和22%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CANet通过有效处理非平稳性，显著提升了长期时间序列预测的准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in various real-world
applications. Despite recent advancements and the success of different
architectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of
the real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal
changes in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous
studies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting,
limiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity
and resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive
Network (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is
the Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the
Style Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and
Belongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates
non-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by
blending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization
while maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which
dynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances
predictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs
multi-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term
trends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce
noise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's
efficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE. The source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/mertsonmezer/CANet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索概念模型在OOD输入下的表现，尤其是概念干预对任务预测的影响，以解决现有模型的局限性。

Method: 提出MixCEM模型，动态利用泄漏信息，仅在分布内时有效利用。

Result: MixCEM在有无概念干预的情况下，均显著提升了分布内和分布外样本的准确性。

Conclusion: MixCEM通过动态利用泄漏信息，解决了现有CMs的泄漏中毒问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how concept-based models (CMs) respond to
out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are interpretable neural architectures
that first predict a set of high-level concepts (e.g., stripes, black) and then
predict a task label from those concepts. In particular, we study the impact of
concept interventions (i.e., operations where a human expert corrects a CM's
mispredicted concepts at test time) on CMs' task predictions when inputs are
OOD. Our analysis reveals a weakness in current state-of-the-art CMs, which we
term leakage poisoning, that prevents them from properly improving their
accuracy when intervened on for OOD inputs. To address this, we introduce
MixCEM, a new CM that learns to dynamically exploit leaked information missing
from its concepts only when this information is in-distribution. Our results
across tasks with and without complete sets of concept annotations demonstrate
that MixCEMs outperform strong baselines by significantly improving their
accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples in the presence and absence
of concept interventions.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often rely on statistical correlations rather

testing methods can identify failures, effective debugging and repair remain
challenging. This paper explores causal inference as an approach primarily for
DNN repair, leveraging causal debugging, counterfactual analysis, and
structural causal models (SCMs) to identify and correct failures. We discuss in
what ways these techniques support fairness, adversarial robustness, and
backdoor mitigation by providing targeted interventions. Finally, we discuss
key challenges, including scalability, generalization, and computational
efficiency, and outline future directions for integrating causality-driven
interventions to enhance DNN reliability.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging subject in machine learning that aims to
solve multiple tasks presented sequentially to the learner without forgetting
previously learned tasks. Recently, many deep learning based approaches have
been proposed for continual learning, however the mathematical foundations
behind existing continual learning methods remain underdeveloped. On the other
hand, adaptive filtering is a classic subject in signal processing with a rich
history of mathematically principled methods. However, its role in
understanding the foundations of continual learning has been underappreciated.
In this tutorial, we review the basic principles behind both continual learning
and adaptive filtering, and present a comparative analysis that highlights
multiple connections between them. These connections allow us to enhance the
mathematical foundations of continual learning based on existing results for
adaptive filtering, extend adaptive filtering insights using existing continual
learning methods, and discuss a few research directions for continual learning
suggested by the historical developments in adaptive filtering.

Method: 设计了一种支持对数时间更新和查询的双参数八叉树，避免了数据分布变化时的高成本完全重建。

Result: 在四个领域展示了其有效性：加速Stein变分梯度下降、实时增量KNN分类、动态索引与检索、联合优化输入和潜在空间。

Conclusion: 该方法在所有应用中均实现了指数级加速，同时保持准确性，尤其在高维空间中表现突出。

Abstract: We present a dynamic self-balancing octree data structure that enables
efficient neighborhood maintenance in evolving metric spaces, a key challenge
in modern machine learning systems. Many learning and generative models operate
as dynamical systems whose representations evolve during training, requiring
fast, adaptive spatial organization. Our two-parameter octree supports
logarithmic-time updates and queries, eliminating the need for costly full
rebuilds as data distributions shift. We demonstrate its effectiveness in four
areas: (1) accelerating Stein variational gradient descent by supporting more
particles with lower overhead; (2) enabling real-time, incremental KNN
classification with logarithmic complexity; (3) facilitating efficient, dynamic
indexing and retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation; and (4) improving
sample efficiency by jointly optimizing input and latent spaces. Across all
applications, our approach yields exponential speedups while preserving
accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where maintaining adaptive
spatial structure is critical.

<details>

Motivation: 城市信号灯交叉口的拥堵导致延误、经济损失和排放增加，现有深度学习模型缺乏空间泛化性且难以实时部署。

Method: 结合时序卷积网络和注意力图神经网络，构建动态、方向感知的交通模型，支持多尺度交通流优化。

Result: TGDT在多种交通条件下表现优异，能快速模拟大量场景，提供高维、并发的多输出估计。

Conclusion: TGDT是一种高效、可扩展且实时的交通信号优化解决方案。

Abstract: Urban congestion at signalized intersections leads to significant delays,
economic losses, and increased emissions. Existing deep learning models often
lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with
real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal
Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic,
direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT
estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at
both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor
level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and
sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of
intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by
accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It
also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic
conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of
traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand
scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable,
and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.

*Emiliano Penaloza,Tianyue H. Zhan,Laurent Charlin,Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数CPO，用于解决概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）中概念标签错误的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs依赖准确的概念标签，但实际数据中标签错误会显著降低性能（某些情况下降低25%）。

Method: 引入概念偏好优化（CPO）目标，基于直接偏好优化，优化概念的后验分布，减少对标签噪声的敏感性。

Result: CPO在三个真实数据集上（无论有无标签噪声）均优于二元交叉熵（BCE）。

Conclusion: CPO能有效缓解概念标签错误对CBMs性能的负面影响，是一种更鲁棒的优化方法。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) propose to enhance the trustworthiness of AI
systems by constraining their decisions on a set of human understandable
concepts. However, CBMs typically assume that datasets contains accurate
concept labels an assumption often violated in practice, which we show can
significantly degrade performance (by 25% in some cases). To address this, we
introduce the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective, a new loss
function based on Direct Preference Optimization, which effectively mitigates
the negative impact of concept mislabeling on CBM performance. We provide an
analysis on some key properties of the CPO objective showing it directly
optimizes for the concept's posterior distribution, and contrast it against
Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) where we show CPO is inherently less sensitive to
concept noise. We empirically confirm our analysis finding that CPO
consistently outperforms BCE in three real world datasets with and without
added label noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究序列建模中数据模式与损失景观几何性质的联系，以理解网络参数如何捕捉数据的主要结构。

Method: 1. 在Hilbert空间框架下对条件序列分布进行建模，并应用张量分解识别主模式；2. 通过截断小幅度模式生成有效数据分布；3. 理论分析局部学习系数（LLC）对数据模式的敏感性。

Result: LLC估计对低于数据依赖阈值的小模式不敏感，因此实际计算的LLC反映的是有效分布而非真实分布的几何性质。

Conclusion: 研究解释了为何在网络参数未严格最小化总体损失时仍能获得可靠的LLC估计，并揭示了SGLD中逆温度参数对景观结构分辨率的作用。

Abstract: We develop a geometric account of sequence modelling that links patterns in
the data to measurable properties of the loss landscape in transformer
networks. First, we cast conditional sequence distributions into a
Hilbert-space framework and apply tensor decompositions to identify their
principal modes. Truncating the small-amplitude modes yields an effective data
distribution that preserves dominant structure while discarding statistical
detail. Second, we show theoretically that Local Learning Coefficient (LLC)
estimates are insensitive to modes below a data-dependent threshold.
Consequently, the LLC calculated in practice characterises the geometry of the
effective rather than the true distribution. This insight clarifies why
reliable LLC estimates can be obtained even when a network parameter is not a
strict minimiser of the population loss, and it highlights how the inverse
temperature in SGLD acts as a resolution dial on the landscape structure.

Conclusion: 结合相信息的模型动物园为WSL提供了结构化多样性，并在下游应用中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Using the weights of trained Neural Network (NN) models as data modality has
recently gained traction as a research field - dubbed Weight Space Learning
(WSL). Multiple recent works propose WSL methods to analyze models, evaluate
methods, or synthesize weights. Weight space learning methods require
populations of trained models as datasets for development and evaluation.
However, existing collections of models - called `model zoos' - are
unstructured or follow a rudimentary definition of diversity. In parallel, work
rooted in statistical physics has identified phases and phase transitions in NN
models. Models are homogeneous within the same phase but qualitatively differ
from one phase to another. We combine the idea of `model zoos' with phase
information to create a controlled notion of diversity in populations. We
introduce 12 large-scale zoos that systematically cover known phases and vary
over model architecture, size, and datasets. These datasets cover different
modalities, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and
scientific ML. For every model, we compute loss landscape metrics and validate
full coverage of the phases. With this dataset, we provide the community with a
resource with a wide range of potential applications for WSL and beyond.
Evidence suggests the loss landscape phase plays a role in applications such as
model training, analysis, or sparsification. We demonstrate this in an
exploratory study of the downstream methods like transfer learning or model
weights averaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式光伏（PV）安装的快速增加，尤其是电表后系统，能源管理和电网运营面临挑战，光伏发电的不可观测性加剧了供需平衡的复杂性。因此，从净负荷中估计光伏发电（即光伏分解）变得至关重要。

Method: 采用个性化联邦学习（PFL）框架，结合本地和全局建模。本地层面设计基于Transformer的光伏分解模型，生成太阳辐照度嵌入表示本地光伏条件；采用自适应本地聚合机制减轻统计异质性影响。全局层面通过中央服务器聚合多数据中心信息，实现隐私保护的跨中心知识共享。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，所提框架相比基准方法提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决光伏分解中的统计异质性和隐私问题提供了有效方法，为分布式光伏管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide,
many being behind-the-meter systems, has significantly challenged energy
management and grid operations, as unobservable PV generation further
complicates the supply-demand balance. Therefore, estimating this generation
from net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns
and the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a
promising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical
and behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV
disaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed
PV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning
(PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local
and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation
model is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing
local PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to
mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting
a portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global
level, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data
centers, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed
framework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN小批量训练方法要么完全随机化（影响效率），要么完全依赖图结构（影响精度），缺乏平衡两者的方案。

Method: 提出COMM-RAND方法，在构建小批量时兼顾图社区结构和随机性，优化GPU缓存使用。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，COMM-RAND将训练时间减少1.8倍（最高2.76倍），精度损失平均仅0.42%。

Conclusion: COMM-RAND在GNN训练效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and
mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs
because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current
mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of
GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ
randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these
randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the
graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory
access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU
caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on
graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness
compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In
this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching
(COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above
extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure
randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction,
leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We
evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND
cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an
accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular
random mini-batching approaches.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在复杂非凸几何形状下比惩罚方法更准确高效。

Conclusion: 该方法为PINN逆分析提供了可靠高效的框架，具有广泛工程应用潜力。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have attracted significant attention in
scientific machine learning for their capability to solve forward and inverse
problems governed by partial differential equations. However, the accuracy of
PINN solutions is often limited by the treatment of boundary conditions.
Conventional penalty-based methods, which incorporate boundary conditions as
penalty terms in the loss function, cannot guarantee exact satisfaction of the
given boundary conditions and are highly sensitive to the choice of penalty
parameters. This paper demonstrates that distance functions, specifically
R-functions, can be leveraged to enforce boundary conditions, overcoming these
limitations. R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate
representation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and
facilitating various types of boundary conditions. We extend this distance
function-based boundary condition imposition method to inverse problems using
PINNs and introduce an adaptive weight tuning technique to ensure reliable and
efficient inverse analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through
several numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the proposed method
solves inverse problems more accurately and efficiently than penalty-based
methods, even in the presence of complex non-convex geometries. This approach
offers a reliable and efficient framework for inverse analysis using PINNs,
with potential applications across a wide range of engineering problems.

Method: 提出了三种架构：CSP-LDA（特征提取与分类）、CSP-LDA-LSTM（序列学习问题建模）和SVD-NN（特征选择与分类）。

Result: CSP-LDA-LSTM在受试者内分类准确率达98.2%，SVD-NN在受试者间分类准确率达96.4%。

Conclusion: 两种架构能有效捕捉受试者不变的EEG特征，表明其鲁棒性和跨受试者泛化能力。

Abstract: While it is beneficial to objectively determine whether a subject is
meditating, most research in the literature reports good results only in a
subject-dependent manner. This study aims to distinguish the modified state of
consciousness experienced during Rajyoga meditation from the resting state of
the brain in a subject-independent manner using EEG data. Three architectures
have been proposed and evaluated: The CSP-LDA Architecture utilizes common
spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM Architecture employs CSP for feature
extraction, LDA for dimensionality reduction, and long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks for classification, modeling the binary classification problem as a
sequence learning problem. The SVD-NN Architecture uses singular value
decomposition (SVD) to select the most relevant components of the EEG signals
and a shallow neural network (NN) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM
architecture gives the best performance with 98.2% accuracy for intra-subject
classification. The SVD-NN architecture provides significant performance with
96.4\% accuracy for inter-subject classification. This is comparable to the
best-reported accuracies in the literature for intra-subject classification.
Both architectures are capable of capturing subject-invariant EEG features for
effectively classifying the meditative state from the resting state. The high
intra-subject and inter-subject classification accuracies indicate these
systems' robustness and their ability to generalize across different subjects.

Abstract: The number of electrified powertrains is ever increasing today towards a more
sustainable future; thus, it is essential that unwanted failures are prevented,
and a reliable operation is secured. Monitoring the internal temperatures of
motors and keeping them under their thresholds is an important first step.
Conventional modeling methods require expert knowledge and complicated
mathematical approaches. With all the data a modern electric drive collects
nowadays during the system operation, it is feasible to apply data-driven
approaches for estimating thermal behaviors. In this paper, multiple
machine-learning methods are investigated on their capability to approximate
the temperatures of the stator winding and bearing in induction motors. The
explored algorithms vary from linear to neural networks. For this reason,
experimental lab data have been captured from a powertrain under predetermined
operating conditions. For each approach, a hyperparameter search is then
performed to find the optimal configuration. All the models are evaluated by
various metrics, and it has been found that neural networks perform
satisfactorily even under transient conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for developing surrogate environments in
reinforcement learning (RL) using the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments in OpenAI Gym environments, particularly Mountain
Car and Lunar Lander. Our results show that SINDy-based surrogate models can
accurately capture the underlying dynamics of these environments while reducing
computational costs by 20-35%. With only 75 interactions for Mountain Car and
1000 for Lunar Lander, we achieve state-wise correlations exceeding 0.997, with
mean squared errors as low as 3.11e-06 for Mountain Car velocity and 1.42e-06
for LunarLander position. RL agents trained in these surrogate environments
require fewer total steps (65,075 vs. 100,000 for Mountain Car and 801,000 vs.
1,000,000 for Lunar Lander) while achieving comparable performance to those
trained in the original environments, exhibiting similar convergence patterns
and final performance metrics. This work contributes to the field of
model-based RL by providing an efficient method for generating accurate,
interpretable surrogate environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在编程和数学推理任务中表现优异，但受限于高质量训练数据的不足。

Method: 提出Think, Prune, Train框架，通过迭代微调模型自身生成的推理轨迹，结合真实数据修剪策略，确保高质量训练数据。

Result: Gemma2-2B在GSM8K上的Pass@1从41.9%提升至57.6%，Gemma2-9B达到82%，LLaMA-3.1-70B甚至超越GPT-4o，达到91%。

Conclusion: 通过自生成推理和系统性数据选择，可以有效提升大语言模型的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
programming and mathematical reasoning tasks, but are constrained by limited
high-quality training data. Synthetic data can be leveraged to enhance
fine-tuning outcomes, but several factors influence this process, including
model size, synthetic data volume, pruning strategy, and number of fine-tuning
rounds. We explore these axes and investigate which conditions enable model
self-improvement. We introduce the Think, Prune, Train process, a scalable
framework that iteratively fine-tunes models on their own reasoning traces,
using ground-truth pruning to ensure high-quality training data. This approach
yields improved performance: on GSM8K, Gemma2-2B achieves a Pass@1 of 57.6%
(from 41.9%), Gemma2-9B reaches 82%, matching LLaMA-3.1-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B
attains 91%, even surpassing GPT-4o, demonstrating the effectiveness of
self-generated reasoning and systematic data selection for improving LLM
capabilities.

### [62] [Score-Based Deterministic Density Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18130)
*Vasily Ilin,Bamdad Hosseini,Jingwei Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数传输模型（SBTM）的确定性采样框架，用于采样未归一化的目标密度π。相比扩散生成模型需要预训练分数函数，SBTM仅需已知∇logπ，并通过动态学习时间变化的分数函数来近似Wasserstein梯度流。该方法具有平滑、可解释的轨迹，且收敛速度与精确梯度流相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在仅知∇logπ的情况下，如何高效采样未归一化目标密度π的问题，扩展了传统扩散生成模型的应用范围。

Method: 通过动态学习时间变化的分数函数∇logf_t，近似Wasserstein梯度流，并利用分数匹配技术。进一步扩展到退火动力学以处理非对数凹目标。

Result: 理论证明SBTM能以最优速率收敛，轨迹平滑且易于与退火动力学结合。数值实验验证了其优于ULA和退火ULA的表现。

Conclusion: SBTM提供了一种高效、可解释的确定性采样方法，适用于更广泛的目标密度采样问题。

Abstract: We propose and analyze a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based
Transport Modeling (SBTM) for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$.
While diffusion generative modeling relies on pre-training the score function
$\nabla \log f_t$ using samples from $\pi$, SBTM addresses the more general and
challenging setting where only $\nabla \log\pi$ is known. SBTM approximates the
Wasserstein gradient flow on KL$(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score
$\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. The learned score gives
immediate access to relative Fisher information, providing a built-in
convergence diagnostic. The deterministic trajectories are smooth,
interpretable, and free of Brownian-motion noise, while having the same
distribution as ULA. We prove that SBTM dissipates relative entropy at the same
rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. We further
extend our framework to annealed dynamics, to handle non log-concave targets.
Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: SBTM converges at the
optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is easily integrated with annealed
dynamics. We compare to the baselines of ULA and annealed ULA.

TL;DR: 本文评估了树提升方法（如XGBoost和Imbalance-XGBoost）在不平衡数据集上的性能，发现数据量和分布对识别性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不平衡数据集中少数类检测困难的问题，特别是在风险评估等实际应用中。

Method: 提出数据准备方法，结合树提升方法和超参数优化，并在不同规模和分布的数据集上评估。

Result: 方法在数据量增加时性能提升，但F1分数随不平衡加剧而下降；超参数优化能改善性能，但需谨慎应用。

Conclusion: 所提方法对数据变化具有一定鲁棒性，但需定期重新训练以维持性能。

Abstract: Most real-world classification problems deal with imbalanced datasets, posing
a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., machine learning
algorithms, because the minority class, which is of extreme interest, often
proves difficult to be detected. This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting
methods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions,
from perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based
methods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection
performance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated.
After introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine
learning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary
classifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree
boosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is
evaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on
distributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the
developed method increases its recognition performance as more data is given
for training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more
imbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of
precision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and
negatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent
improvement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter
optimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on
data volume and distribution. Finally, the developed method is robust to data
variation over time up to some point. Retraining can be used when performance
starts deteriorating.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法因随机扰动生成增强视图而引入噪声，且对难易样本对赋予相同权重，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出SVD增强模块（SVD-aug）避免随机噪声扰动，并设计局部-全局依赖学习模块（LGDL）自适应调整样本对权重。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CSG2L优于现有基线方法，且兼容多种GNN。

Conclusion: CSG2L通过改进对比信号生成和样本对权重分配，提升了图对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently
since it learns complex structural information from graphs through
self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from
performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely,
they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which
leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In
addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby
ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these
issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for
Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building
a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to
obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise
perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL)
with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of
hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines.
Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的模仿学习方法，通过时间一致性和可控性生成多样化的行为策略，解决了传统方法在行为多样性和可控性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习方法通常仅从专家数据中学习单一策略，难以生成多样化的行为或实现可控的轨迹生成。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于时间一致性和可控性的方法，通过构建行为潜在空间，确保行为在整段轨迹中的一致性，并允许用户根据需要选择性激活特定行为。

Result: 在多种任务和环境中与现有方法进行比较，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更好地复现演示数据的多样性，并提供可控的行为生成能力。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) techniques aim to replicate human behaviors in
specific tasks. While IL has gained prominence due to its effectiveness and
efficiency, traditional methods often focus on datasets collected from experts
to produce a single efficient policy. Recently, extensions have been proposed
to handle datasets of diverse behaviors by mainly focusing on learning
transition-level diverse policies or on performing entropy maximization at the
trajectory level. While these methods may lead to diverse behaviors, they may
not be sufficient to reproduce the actual diversity of demonstrations or to
allow controlled trajectory generation. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose
a different method based on two key features: a) Temporal Consistency that
ensures consistent behaviors across entire episodes and not just at the
transition level as well as b) Controllability obtained by constructing a
latent space of behaviors that allows users to selectively activate specific
behaviors based on their requirements. We compare our approach to
state-of-the-art methods over a diverse set of tasks and environments. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海洋区域定义常为主观决策，可能导致误导性结果。本研究旨在通过客观方法定义北大西洋区域，以支持海洋研究和保护任务。

Method: 使用KMeans、Ward和DBSCAN等聚类方法，结合UMAP降维技术，对3亿条盐度、温度等数据进行分析，并通过NEMI聚合100次UMAP-DBSCAN运行结果。

Result: UMAP-DBSCAN方法表现最佳，生成321个聚类，与现有水团定义高度一致，且区域化更详细。

Conclusion: 该方法客观、高效且可重复，有助于未来海洋生物地球化学差异和变化的研究。

Abstract: Defining ocean regions and water masses helps to understand marine processes
and can serve downstream-tasks such as defining marine protected areas.
However, such definitions are often a result of subjective decisions
potentially producing misleading, unreproducible results. Here, the aim was to
objectively define regions of the North Atlantic. For this, a data-driven,
systematic machine learning approach was applied to generate and validate ocean
clusters employing external, internal and relative validation techniques. About
300 million measured salinity, temperature, and oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and
silicate concentration values served as input for various clustering methods
(KMeans, agglomerative Ward, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)). Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) emphasised (dis-)similarities in the data while reducing
dimensionality. Based on a systematic validation of the considered clustering
methods and their hyperparameters, the results showed that UMAP-DBSCAN best
represented the data. To address stochastic variability, 100 UMAP-DBSCAN
clustering runs were conducted and aggregated using Native Emergent Manifold
Interrogation (NEMI), producing a final set of 321 clusters. Reproducibility
was evaluated by calculating the ensemble overlap (88.81 +- 1.8%) and the mean
grid cell-wise uncertainty estimated by NEMI (15.49 +- 20%). The presented
clustering results agreed very well with common water mass definitions. This
study revealed a more detailed regionalization compared to previous concepts
such as the Longhurst provinces. The applied method is objective, efficient and
reproducible and will support future research focusing on biogeochemical
differences and changes in oceanic regions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source and reproducible implementation of Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks for time
series forecasting. We evaluated LSTM and GRU networks because of their
performance reported in related work. We describe our method and its results on
two datasets. The first dataset is the S&P BSE BANKEX, composed of stock time
series (closing prices) of ten financial institutions. The second dataset,
called Activities, comprises ten synthetic time series resembling weekly
activities with five days of high activity and two days of low activity. We
report Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between actual and predicted values, as
well as Directional Accuracy (DA). We show that a single time series from a
dataset can be used to adequately train the networks if the sequences in the
dataset contain patterns that repeat, even with certain variation, and are
properly processed. For 1-step ahead and 20-step ahead forecasts, LSTM and GRU
networks significantly outperform a baseline on the Activities dataset. The
baseline simply repeats the last available value. On the stock market dataset,
the networks perform just like the baseline, possibly due to the nature of
these series. We release the datasets used as well as the implementation with
all experiments performed to enable future comparisons and to make our research
reproducible.

Motivation: 现有研究表明仅依赖收盘价不足以准确预测比特币价格，需探索更多时间序列以提升预测性能。

Method: 通过实验评估不同时间序列和机器学习算法，确定Open、High、Low为关键特征，并采用GRU网络与基线预测的集成方法。

Result: Low时间序列贡献最大，非价格相关特征影响可忽略，方法在方向准确性上达到先进水平。

Conclusion: Open、High、Low时间序列结合GRU集成方法能有效提升比特币价格预测的方向准确性。

Abstract: Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that is gaining more popularity in
recent years. Previous studies have shown that closing price alone is not
enough to forecast stock market series. We introduce a new set of time series
and demonstrate that a subset is necessary to improve directional accuracy
based on a machine learning ensemble. In our experiments, we study which time
series and machine learning algorithms deliver the best results. We found that
the most relevant time series that contribute to improving directional accuracy
are Open, High and Low, with the largest contribution of Low in combination
with an ensemble of Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The
relevance of other Bitcoin-related features that are not price-related is
negligible. The proposed method delivers similar performance to the
state-of-the-art when observing directional accuracy.

Motivation: 研究激活函数选择对神经网络频谱偏置的影响，以及梯度下降如何通过隐式调整频率分量来控制这一偏置。

Method: 通过理论分析，将梯度下降重新解释为收缩算子，并研究其对神经网络Jacobian矩阵奇异值的掩蔽作用。同时探讨了学习率和迭代次数与带宽的关系。

Result: 梯度下降的隐式正则化仅在单调激活函数下有效，而非单调激活函数（如sinc、高斯）可作为频谱偏置的高效迭代替代方案。

Conclusion: 激活函数的选择和梯度下降超参数对频谱偏置有显著影响，非单调激活函数在迭代效率上具有优势。

Abstract: We generalize the connection between activation function and spline
regression/smoothing and characterize how this choice may influence spectral
bias within a 1D shallow network. We then demonstrate how gradient descent (GD)
can be reinterpreted as a shrinkage operator that masks the singular values of
a neural network's Jacobian. Viewed this way, GD implicitly selects the number
of frequency components to retain, thereby controlling the spectral bias. An
explicit relationship is proposed between the choice of GD hyperparameters
(learning rate & number of iterations) and bandwidth (the number of active
components). GD regularization is shown to be effective only with monotonic
activation functions. Finally, we highlight the utility of non-monotonic
activation functions (sinc, Gaussian) as iteration-efficient surrogates for
spectral bias.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在教师-学生设置中提供了特征分布收敛的理论保证，为神经网络训练提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field
single hidden layer neural networks with square loss. Observing this is a
separable non-linear least-square problem which is linear w.r.t. the outer
layer's weights, we consider a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale
learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the
learning problem to the training of the feature distribution. Whereas most
convergence rates or the training of neural networks rely on a neural tangent
kernel analysis where features are fixed, we show such a strategy enables
provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution.
Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show
that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted
ultra-fast diffusion equation. Relying on recent results on the asymptotic
behavior of such PDEs, we obtain guarantees for the convergence of the trained
feature distribution towards the teacher feature distribution in a
teacher-student setup.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery lifespan is vital for ensuring
operational reliability and reducing maintenance costs in applications like
electric vehicles and smart grids. This study presents a hybrid learning
framework for precise battery lifespan prediction, integrating dynamic
multi-source data fusion with a stacked ensemble (SE) modeling approach. By
leveraging heterogeneous datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE),
MIT-Stanford-Toyota Research Institute (TRC), and nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA)
chemistries, an entropy-based dynamic weighting mechanism mitigates variability
across heterogeneous datasets. The SE model combines Ridge regression, long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
effectively capturing temporal dependencies and nonlinear degradation patterns.
It achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0058, root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.0092, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9839,
outperforming established baseline models with a 46.2% improvement in R2 and an
83.2% reduction in RMSE. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis
identifies differential discharge capacity (Qdlin) and temperature of
measurement (Temp_m) as critical aging indicators. This scalable, interpretable
framework enhances battery health management, supporting optimized maintenance
and safety across diverse energy storage systems, thereby contributing to
improved battery health management in energy storage systems.

Result: 实验表明DualRAG显著提升答案准确性和连贯性，部分情况下超越基于预设知识的性能。

Conclusion: DualRAG为复杂多跳推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks permeate real-world applications,
posing challenges in orchestrating multi-step reasoning across diverse
knowledge domains. While existing approaches have been improved with iterative
retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To
address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that
seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two
tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive
Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the
reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired
knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This
creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement.
Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and
retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its
versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer
accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the
performance achieved with oracle knowledge access. These results establish
DualRAG as a robust and efficient solution for complex multi-hop reasoning
tasks.

Result: 在算法公平性常用数据集上验证，C-LRT能有效控制和平衡分类准确性与公平性。

Conclusion: C-LRT成功实现了在决策树中同时优化准确性和公平性的目标。

Abstract: Given the high computational complexity of decision tree estimation,
classical methods construct a tree by adding one node at a time in a recursive
way. To facilitate promoting fairness, we propose a fairness criterion local to
the tree nodes. We prove how it is related to the Statistical Parity criterion,
popular in the Algorithmic Fairness literature, and show how to incorporate it
into standard recursive tree estimation algorithms.
  We present a tree estimation algorithm called Constrained Logistic Regression
Tree (C-LRT), which is a modification of the standard CART algorithm using
locally linear classifiers and imposing restrictions as done in Constrained
Logistic Regression.
  Finally, we evaluate the performance of trees estimated with C-LRT on
datasets commonly used in the Algorithmic Fairness literature, using various
classification and fairness metrics. The results confirm that C-LRT
successfully allows to control and balance accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning
solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system
for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing
pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes
model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit
complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this
study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators
(Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural
Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1)
discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary
conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios
with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in
complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary
conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The
predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total
variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is
similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce
artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves
in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator
architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their
ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also
raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where
shock preservation is essential.

*Garrett Baker,George Wang,Jesse Hoogland,Daniel Murfet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于线性响应框架的神经网络可解释性方法，通过微调数据分布来量化网络组件的响应，并利用局部采样和低秩结构分析功能模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是开发一种能够解释神经网络行为的统计力学框架，通过小扰动量化网络组件的响应，从而理解其功能模块和局部学习特性。

Method: 方法包括将神经网络视为贝叶斯统计力学系统，通过数据分布的微小扰动（如改变文本类型）诱导网络后验期望的变化，并利用局部SGLD采样估计响应。

Result: 结果表明，响应矩阵的低秩结构能够分离功能模块（如多词和归纳头），并揭示了局部损失景观在数据分布变化下的几何变形。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法通过线性响应理论将局部学习系数与数据分布变化联系起来，为神经网络的可解释性提供了新工具。

Abstract: We develop a linear response framework for interpretability that treats a
neural network as a Bayesian statistical mechanical system. A small, controlled
perturbation of the data distribution, for example shifting the Pile toward
GitHub or legal text, induces a first-order change in the posterior expectation
of an observable localized on a chosen component of the network. The resulting
susceptibility can be estimated efficiently with local SGLD samples and
factorizes into signed, per-token contributions that serve as attribution
scores. Building a set of perturbations (probes) yields a response matrix whose
low-rank structure separates functional modules such as multigram and induction
heads in a 3M-parameter transformer. Susceptibilities link local learning
coefficients from singular learning theory with linear-response theory, and
quantify how local loss landscape geometry deforms under shifts in the data
distribution.

Result: 将指标分为点基、分箱基、核或曲线基、累积四类分类器指标及目标检测指标。

Conclusion: 概率校准指标的分类和整理为未来研究提供了实现和比较的基础。

Abstract: Probabilities or confidence values produced by artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) models often do not reflect their true accuracy, with
some models being under or over confident in their predictions. For example, if
a model is 80% sure of an outcome, is it correct 80% of the time? Probability
calibration metrics measure the discrepancy between confidence and accuracy,
providing an independent assessment of model calibration performance that
complements traditional accuracy metrics. Understanding calibration is
important when the outputs of multiple systems are combined, for assurance in
safety or business-critical contexts, and for building user trust in models.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of probability calibration metrics
for classifier and object detection models, organising them according to a
number of different categorisations to highlight their relationships. We
identify 82 major metrics, which can be grouped into four classifier families
(point-based, bin-based, kernel or curve-based, and cumulative) and an object
detection family. For each metric, we provide equations where available,
facilitating implementation and comparison by future researchers.

Result: 在3D仿真环境中显著优于随机基线，展示了拓扑结构和宏动作抽象的高效性。

Conclusion: 拓扑结构和宏动作抽象能够从像素数据中实现高效的样本学习。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of navigation in large, visually complex
environments with sparse rewards. We propose a method that uses object-oriented
macro actions grounded in a topological map, allowing a simple Deep Q-Network
(DQN) to learn effective navigation policies. The agent builds a map by
detecting objects from RGBD input and selecting discrete macro actions that
correspond to navigating to these objects. This abstraction drastically reduces
the complexity of the underlying reinforcement learning problem and enables
generalization to unseen environments. We evaluate our approach in a
photorealistic 3D simulation and show that it significantly outperforms a
random baseline under both immediate and terminal reward conditions. Our
results demonstrate that topological structure and macro-level abstraction can
enable sample-efficient learning even from pixel data.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential for facilitating diverse socio-economic
activity and environmental conservation initiatives. Deep learning techniques
are increasingly being explored as complementary approaches to Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) models, offering potential benefits such as reduced
complexity and enhanced adaptability in specific applications. This work
presents a novel design, Small Shuffled Attention UNet (SSA-UNet), which
enhances SmaAt-UNet's architecture by including a shuffle channeling mechanism
to optimize performance and diminish complexity. To assess its efficacy, this
architecture and its reduced variant are examined and trained on two datasets:
a Dutch precipitation dataset from 2016 to 2019, and a French cloud cover
dataset containing radar images from 2017 to 2018. Three output configurations
of the proposed architecture are evaluated, yielding outputs of 1, 6, and 12
precipitation maps, respectively. To better understand how this model operates
and produces its predictions, a gradient-based approach called Grad-CAM is used
to analyze the outputs generated. The analysis of heatmaps generated by
Grad-CAM facilitated the identification of regions within the input maps that
the model considers most informative for generating its predictions. The
implementation of SSA-UNet can be found on our

Abstract: Balancing performance and interpretability in multivariate time series
classification is a significant challenge due to data complexity and high
dimensionality. This paper introduces PHeatPruner, a method integrating
persistent homology and sheaf theory to address these challenges. Persistent
homology facilitates the pruning of up to 45% of the applied variables while
maintaining or enhancing the accuracy of models such as Random Forest,
CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, all without depending on posterior
probabilities or supervised optimization algorithms. Concurrently, sheaf theory
contributes explanatory vectors that provide deeper insights into the data's
structural nuances. The approach was validated using the UEA Archive and a
mastitis detection dataset for dairy cows. The results demonstrate that
PHeatPruner effectively preserves model accuracy. Furthermore, our results
highlight PHeatPruner's key features, i.e. simplifying complex data and
offering actionable insights without increasing processing time or complexity.
This method bridges the gap between complexity reduction and interpretability,
suggesting promising applications in various fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型中的偏见可能导致基于敏感属性（如性别和种族）的歧视性决策。尽管已有许多研究关注AI模型的偏见诊断和缓解，但GNNs中的个体公平性研究较少。GNNs的图结构特性使得偏见可能通过节点连接传播，增加了公平性检测和缓解的复杂性。

Result: 尚未明确（论文为博士项目计划）。

Conclusion: 该项目旨在填补GNNs个体公平性研究的空白，并提供实用的测试框架，以促进公平AI的发展。

Abstract: The biases in artificial intelligence (AI) models can lead to automated
decision-making processes that discriminate against groups and/or individuals
based on sensitive properties such as gender and race. While there are many
studies on diagnosing and mitigating biases in various AI models, there is
little research on individual fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike
traditional models, which treat data features independently and overlook their
inter-relationships, GNNs are designed to capture graph-based structure where
nodes are interconnected. This relational approach enables GNNs to model
complex dependencies, but it also means that biases can propagate through these
connections, complicating the detection and mitigation of individual fairness
violations. This PhD project aims to develop a testing framework to assess and
ensure individual fairness in GNNs. It first systematically reviews the
literature on individual fairness, categorizing existing approaches to define,
measure, test, and mitigate model biases, creating a taxonomy of individual
fairness. Next, the project will develop a framework for testing and ensuring
fairness in GNNs by adapting and extending current fairness testing and
mitigation techniques. The framework will be evaluated through industrial case
studies, focusing on graph-based large language models.

Result: 通过真实飞行数据验证，该方法提供了直观的策略解释，提升了AI模型与人类决策者之间的理解。

Conclusion: 该框架显著增强了基于强化学习的切换决策的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks
presents significant mobility management challenges, primarily due to frequent
handovers caused by probabilistic line-of-sight conditions with multiple ground
base stations (BSs). To tackle these challenges, reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods, particularly deep Q-networks (DQN), have been employed to
optimize handover decisions dynamically. However, a major drawback of these
learning-based approaches is their black-box nature, which limits
interpretability in the decision-making process. This paper introduces an
explainable AI (XAI) framework that incorporates Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) to provide deeper insights into how various state parameters influence
handover decisions in a DQN-based mobility management system. By quantifying
the impact of key features such as reference signal received power (RSRP),
reference signal received quality (RSRQ), buffer status, and UAV position, our
approach enhances the interpretability and reliability of RL-based handover
solutions. To validate and compare our framework, we utilize real-world network
performance data collected from UAV flight trials. Simulation results show that
our method provides intuitive explanations for policy decisions, effectively
bridging the gap between AI-driven models and human decision-makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习中缺失数据已有研究，但模型评估时标签缺失问题被忽视，忽略缺失样本可能引入偏差，尤其是在MNAR情况下。

Method: 采用多重插补技术，评估分类器性能（如精度、召回率、ROC-AUC），并提供缺失标签时的预测分布。

Result: 实证表明预测分布的位置和形状在MNAR情况下仍准确，且分布近似高斯，提供了有限样本收敛边界和鲁棒性证明。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标签缺失问题，提供了可靠的性能评估工具。

Abstract: Missing data in supervised learning is well-studied, but the specific issue
of missing labels during model evaluation has been overlooked. Ignoring samples
with missing values, a common solution, can introduce bias, especially when
data is Missing Not At Random (MNAR). We propose a multiple imputation
technique for evaluating classifiers using metrics such as precision, recall,
and ROC-AUC. This method not only offers point estimates but also a predictive
distribution for these quantities when labels are missing. We empirically show
that the predictive distribution's location and shape are generally correct,
even in the MNAR regime. Moreover, we establish that this distribution is
approximately Gaussian and provide finite-sample convergence bounds.
Additionally, a robustness proof is presented, confirming the validity of the
approximation under a realistic error model.

Conclusion: 本文为校准领域提供了语义地图，帮助理解碎片化的概念和定义，并讨论了分组在多校准中的作用。

Abstract: Fueled by discussions around "trustworthiness" and algorithmic fairness,
calibration of predictive systems has regained scholars attention. The vanilla
definition and understanding of calibration is, simply put, on all days on
which the rain probability has been predicted to be p, the actual frequency of
rain days was p. However, the increased attention has led to an immense variety
of new notions of "calibration." Some of the notions are incomparable, serve
different purposes, or imply each other. In this work, we provide two accounts
which motivate calibration: self-realization of forecasted properties and
precise estimation of incurred losses of the decision makers relying on
forecasts. We substantiate the former via the reflection principle and the
latter by actuarial fairness. For both accounts we formulate prototypical
definitions via properties $\Gamma$ of outcome distributions, e.g., the mean or
median. The prototypical definition for self-realization, which we call
$\Gamma$-calibration, is equivalent to a certain type of swap regret under
certain conditions. These implications are strongly connected to the
omniprediction learning paradigm. The prototypical definition for precise loss
estimation is a modification of decision calibration adopted from Zhao et al.
[73]. For binary outcome sets both prototypical definitions coincide under
appropriate choices of reference properties. For higher-dimensional outcome
sets, both prototypical definitions can be subsumed by a natural extension of
the binary definition, called distribution calibration with respect to a
property. We conclude by commenting on the role of groupings in both accounts
of calibration often used to obtain multicalibration. In sum, this work
provides a semantic map of calibration in order to navigate a fragmented
terrain of notions and definitions.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of nonlinear solver acceleration for systems of
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that is based on
online/adaptive learning. It is applied in the context of multiphase flow in
porous media. The proposed method rely on four pillars: (i) dimensionless
numbers as input parameters for the machine learning model, (ii) simplified
numerical model (two-dimensional) for the offline training, (iii) dynamic
control of a nonlinear solver tuning parameter (numerical relaxation), (iv) and
online learning for real-time improvement of the machine learning model. This
strategy decreases the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically modifying
a single global parameter, the relaxation factor, and by adaptively learning
the attributes of each numerical model on-the-run. Furthermore, this work
performs a sensitivity study in the dimensionless parameters (machine learning
features), assess the efficacy of various machine learning models, demonstrate
a decrease in nonlinear iterations using our method in more intricate,
realistic three-dimensional models, and fully couple a machine learning model
into an open-source multiphase flow simulator achieving up to 85\% reduction in
computational time.

In this work, we introduce a set of axioms to rigorously assess measures of

Conclusion: 通过NC视角优化特征空间分布，NCPTM-CIL显著提升了CIL性能，为预训练模型在持续学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world
applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining
knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs)
have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior
performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features
evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in
PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon
observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated,
equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL
effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry
enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning.
Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained
Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature
space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual
learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when
initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by
6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.

Abstract: Due to rapid population growth globally, digitally-enabled agricultural
sectors are crucial for sustainable food production and making informed
decisions about resource management for farmers and various stakeholders. The
deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that collect real-time
observations of various environmental (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and
operational factors (e.g., irrigation) influencing production is often seen as
a critical step to enable additional novel downstream tasks, such as AI-based
yield forecasting. However, since AI models require large amounts of data, this
creates practical challenges in a real-world dynamic farm setting where IoT
observations would need to be collected over a number of seasons. In this
study, we deployed IoT sensors in strawberry production polytunnels for two
growing seasons to collect environmental data, including water usage, external
and internal temperature, external and internal humidity, soil moisture, soil
temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation. The sensor observations
were combined with manually provided yield records spanning a period of four
seasons. To bridge the gap of missing IoT observations for two additional
seasons, we propose an AI-based backcasting approach to generate synthetic
sensor observations using historical weather data from a nearby weather station
and the existing polytunnel observations. We built an AI-based yield
forecasting model to evaluate our approach using the combination of real and
synthetic observations. Our results demonstrated that incorporating synthetic
data improved yield forecasting accuracy, with models incorporating synthetic
data outperforming those trained only on historical yield, weather records, and
real sensor data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型规模的扩大和训练数据集的增加，分布式深度学习方法的开发变得尤为重要。数据并行训练需要频繁的全局通信，这在大规模训练中可能成为瓶颈。

Method: PALSGD是Local SGD和DiLoCo的扩展，通过引入伪同步机制进一步减少通信频率，同时保持模型一致性。

Conclusion: PALSGD通过减少通信频率提高了训练效率，同时保持了模型性能，为大规模深度学习训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and
continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge
investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven
development of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an
essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global
communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest
scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD
(PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an
extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023),
designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a
pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer
synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced
communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model
consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those
achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a
theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its
convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior
and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and
language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better
performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data
Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on
ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with

Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths
connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the
complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches
use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their
ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as
high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we
address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from
stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained
generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under
these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to
minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to
repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in
contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We
demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse,
physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the
pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily
incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as
models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

<details>

Conclusion: 论文为联邦学习在无线网络中的安全应用提供了攻击和防御的解决方案，增强了网络的能源效率和安全性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique for learning-based functions
in wireless networks, thanks to its distributed implementation capability. On
the other hand, distributed learning may increase the risk of exposure to
malicious attacks where attacks on a local model may spread to other models by
parameter exchange. Meanwhile, such attacks can be hard to detect due to the
dynamic wireless environment, especially considering local models can be
heterogeneous with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data.
Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the effect of malicious attacks and
develop advanced defense techniques for FL-enabled wireless networks. In this
work, we introduce a federated deep reinforcement learning-based cell sleep
control scenario that enhances the energy efficiency of the network. We propose
multiple intelligent attacks targeting the learning-based approach and we
propose defense methods to mitigate such attacks. In particular, we have
designed two attack models, generative adversarial network (GAN)-enhanced model
poisoning attack and regularization-based model poisoning attack. As a
counteraction, we have proposed two defense schemes, autoencoder-based defense,
and knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled defense. The autoencoder-based defense
method leverages an autoencoder to identify the malicious participants and only
aggregate the parameters of benign local models during the global aggregation,
while KD-based defense protects the model from attacks by controlling the
knowledge transferred between the global model and local models.

Method: 通过信息理论和数据分布特性分析泛化差距上界，提出条件熵对泛化能力的影响。

Result: 高条件熵能平坦化似然景观，减少泛化差距上界，并缩短SGD逃离尖锐局部极小值的时间。

Conclusion: 模仿学习的泛化能力不仅依赖于输入数据的多样性，还需丰富相同输入下输出标签的变异性。

Abstract: Imitation learning holds the promise of equipping robots with versatile
skills by learning from expert demonstrations. However, policies trained on
finite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution.
In this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability
of imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data
distribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper
bounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate
representations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters
and the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance
for designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly
in determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders
(e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to
achieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high
conditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood
landscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In
addition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from
sharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima
under fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning
often exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only
scaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of
output labels conditioned on the same input.

TL;DR: iVR-GS是一种创新的新型视图合成方法，通过高斯溅射实现逆体积渲染，降低渲染成本并支持场景编辑，提升交互式体积探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NVS方法在渲染速度和硬件需求上表现优异，但预设的传输函数限制了用户对场景的探索。iVR-GS旨在解决这一限制，同时保持高效渲染。

Method: iVR-GS通过组合多个与基本传输函数关联的模型，覆盖场景的不同可见部分，每个模型包含可编辑的3D高斯点，支持实时渲染和编辑。

Result: 实验表明，iVR-GS在重建质量和可组合性上优于Plenoxels、CCNeRF和基础3DGS等方法。

Conclusion: iVR-GS为交互式体积探索提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，显著提升了用户体验。

Abstract: In volume visualization, users can interactively explore the
three-dimensional data by specifying color and opacity mappings in the transfer
function (TF) or adjusting lighting parameters, facilitating meaningful
interpretation of the underlying structure. However, rendering large-scale
volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time
performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster
rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a
reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings,
significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume
rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that
reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume
exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with
basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene
visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where
each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and
editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability
of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on
various volume datasets. The code is available at

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛丢弃方法作为贝叶斯近似，构建了深度贝叶斯卷积脉冲神经网络，并引入不确定性感知模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在多个医学图像分类任务中表现准确且可靠。

Conclusion: 提出的模型可作为传统深度学习的替代方案，适用于医学图像分类任务。

Abstract: The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of
diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural
network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the
benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power
consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information.
However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability.
To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the
uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional
Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study,
the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an
uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical
image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed model is accurate and reliable and will be a proper alternative to
conventional deep learning for medical image classification.

Motivation: 传统计算白质形状测量的方法计算成本高且耗时，限制了大规模数据集的分析。

Method: 提出Tract2Shape，结合几何（点云）和标量（表格）特征，利用降维算法预测主要形状成分，并在HCP-YA和PPMI数据集上训练和评估。

Result: Tract2Shape在所有形状测量中表现最优，Pearson's r最高，nMSE最低，且在未见过的PPMI数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: Tract2Shape为大规模白质形状分析提供了快速、准确且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter
tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and
associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional
methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and
time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based
representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning
framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features
to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model
efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to
predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on
two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset.
We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the
HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To
further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test
Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep
learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average
Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows
that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the
unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low
nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation.
Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white
matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis
across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future
large-scale white matter shape analysis.

Abstract: The widespread integration of new technologies in low-voltage distribution
networks on the consumer side creates the need for distribution system
operators to perform advanced real-time calculations to estimate network
conditions. In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and
big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the
information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other
advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms
do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They
lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies
based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from
the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact
of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It
proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine
learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the
time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual
anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly
detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution
networks with a high share of smart meters.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设噪声为高斯或次高斯分布，而实际应用中噪声可能更复杂。本文旨在放宽噪声假设，使其仅需满足二阶矩条件。

Method: 利用鲁棒统计工具和提升（boosting）思想，提出了一种新的系统识别算法。

Result: 即使在更弱的噪声假设下，算法的样本复杂度与次高斯噪声下的结果接近，且对失败概率的依赖为对数级。

Conclusion: 该算法在仅需输入过程满足有限四阶矩的条件下，实现了近乎最优的性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide
non-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general
heavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or
sub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that
are required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we
leverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification
algorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise
assumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity
bounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular,
we establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed
failure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by
requiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.

Abstract: This paper concerns corpus poisoning attacks in dense information retrieval,
where an adversary attempts to compromise the ranking performance of a search
algorithm by injecting a small number of maliciously generated documents into
the corpus. Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature.
First, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search
do so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the
continuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that
operates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation
model with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the
original and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the
token-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents.
Second, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the
adversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a
more challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior
knowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core
contribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We
present comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain
datasets, focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning
attack. We consider attacks under both a white-box and a black-box setting.
Notably, our method can generate successful adversarial examples in under two
minutes per target document; four times faster compared to the fastest
gradient-based word substitution methods in the literature with the same
hardware. Furthermore, our adversarial generation method generates text that is
more likely to occur under the distribution of natural text (low perplexity),
and is therefore more difficult to detect.

Abstract: Representation learning, a task of learning latent vectors to represent
entities, is a key task in improving search and recommender systems in web
applications. Various representation learning methods have been developed,
including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities,
sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities,
and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the
development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to
support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper
presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal
representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates
graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by
employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph
data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and
inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of
supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal
representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user
experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide
repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of
unifying representation learning methods, and we will open source the OmniSage

Motivation: 现有跨域序列推荐方法依赖用户在所有域的行为数据（重叠困境），且难以捕捉复杂转移模式（转移复杂性），限制了实用性。

Method: 提出LLM4CDSR模型，包括LLM统一表示模块、可训练适配器和层次化用户偏好模块，通过三线程框架整合。

Result: 在三个公开跨域数据集上验证了LLM4CDSR的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM4CDSR通过LLMs的语义能力解决了跨域推荐的核心问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference
from the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some
progress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e.,
overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR
methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn
cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter
refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the
mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities,
Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by
bridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view.
Therefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation
model (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose
an LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a
trainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR
task. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize
user cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into
the proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted
extensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the
effectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.

Motivation: 传统LON构建和分析未利用问题结构信息，本文旨在通过结合子函数信息改进LON分析，以更深入理解优化动态。

Method: 采用三种方法构建LON：标准算法、基于确定性灰盒交叉的算法，以及基于学习变量交互信息选择扰动的算法，并提出与子函数变化相关的度量指标。

Result: 结合问题结构的LON构建和分析能提供更丰富的优化动态信息，有助于理解现代链接学习优化器解决问题的难度。

Conclusion: 建议将问题结构纳入LON分析，作为已知或疑似子函数结构问题的替代范式。

Abstract: Local optima networks (LONs) capture fitness landscape information. They are
typically constructed in a black-box manner; information about the problem
structure is not utilised. This also applies to the analysis of LONs: knowledge
about the problem, such as interaction between variables, is not considered. We
challenge this status-quo with an alternative approach: we consider how LON
analysis can be improved by incorporating subfunction-based information - this
can either be known a-priori or learned during search. To this end, LONs are
constructed for several benchmark pseudo-boolean problems using three
approaches: firstly, the standard algorithm; a second algorithm which uses
deterministic grey-box crossover; and a third algorithm which selects
perturbations based on learned information about variable interactions. Metrics
related to subfunction changes in a LON are proposed and compared with metrics
from previous literature which capture other aspects of a LON. Incorporating
problem structure in LON construction and analysing it can bring enriched
insight into optimisation dynamics. Such information may be crucial to
understanding the difficulty of solving a given problem with state-of-the-art
linkage learning optimisers. In light of the results, we suggest incorporation
of problem structure as an alternative paradigm in landscape analysis for
problems with known or suspected subfunction structure.

Abstract: Optimization algorithms are widely employed to tackle complex problems, but
designing them manually is often labor-intensive and requires significant
expertise. Global placement is a fundamental step in electronic design
automation (EDA). While analytical approaches represent the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) in global placement, their core optimization algorithms remain heavily
dependent on heuristics and customized components, such as initialization
strategies, preconditioning methods, and line search techniques. This paper
presents an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLM) to
evolve optimization algorithms for global placement. We first generate diverse
candidate algorithms using LLM through carefully crafted prompts. Then we
introduce an LLM-based genetic flow to evolve selected candidate algorithms.
The discovered optimization algorithms exhibit substantial performance
improvements across many benchmarks. Specifically, Our design-case-specific
discovered algorithms achieve average HPWL improvements of \textbf{5.05\%},
\text{5.29\%} and \textbf{8.30\%} on MMS, ISPD2005 and ISPD2019 benchmarks, and

Result: EDNAG在架构优化中达到SOTA性能，准确率提升高达10.45%，推理速度平均提升50倍。

Conclusion: EDNAG结合进化策略和扩散模型的优势，实现了高效且无需训练的架构生成，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its
transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and
complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs.
Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a
generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures
for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion
models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by
high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose
Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel
approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation.
EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in
diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian
distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the
strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and
effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with
an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need
for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50
times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper introduces decentralized and modular neural network framework
designed to enhance the scalability, interpretability, and performance of
artificial intelligence (AI) systems. At the heart of this framework is a
dynamic switch mechanism that governs the selective activation and training of
individual neurons based on input characteristics, allowing neurons to
specialize in distinct segments of the data domain. This approach enables
neurons to learn from disjoint subsets of data, mimicking biological brain
function by promoting task specialization and improving the interpretability of
neural network behavior. Furthermore, the paper explores the application of
federated learning and decentralized training for real-world AI deployments,
particularly in edge computing and distributed environments. By simulating
localized training on non-overlapping data subsets, we demonstrate how modular
networks can be efficiently trained and evaluated. The proposed framework also
addresses scalability, enabling AI systems to handle large datasets and
distributed processing while preserving model transparency and
interpretability. Finally, we discuss the potential of this approach in
advancing the design of scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient AI systems
for diverse applications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AV公司不愿共享安全关键数据的原因包括数据蕴含关键知识且资源密集，以及公司视其为竞争优势而非公共知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AV公司不愿共享安全关键数据的原因，以促进数据共享的新方法。

Method: 采访12名AV公司员工，分析数据共享的障碍。

Result: 发现两大障碍：数据蕴含关键知识且资源密集，公司视其为竞争优势。

Conclusion: 需通过分层知识、创新工具和激励措施促进数据共享。

Abstract: Safety-critical data, such as crash and near-crash records, are crucial to
improving autonomous vehicle (AV) design and development. Sharing such data
across AV companies, academic researchers, regulators, and the public can help
make all AVs safer. However, AV companies rarely share safety-critical data
externally. This paper aims to pinpoint why AV companies are reluctant to share
safety-critical data, with an eye on how these barriers can inform new
approaches to promote sharing. We interviewed twelve AV company employees who
actively work with such data in their day-to-day work. Findings suggest two
key, previously unknown barriers to data sharing: (1) Datasets inherently embed
salient knowledge that is key to improving AV safety and are
resource-intensive. Therefore, data sharing, even within a company, is fraught
with politics. (2) Interviewees believed AV safety knowledge is private
knowledge that brings competitive edges to their companies, rather than public
knowledge for social good. We discuss the implications of these findings for
incentivizing and enabling safety-critical AV data sharing, specifically,
implications for new approaches to (1) debating and stratifying public and
private AV safety knowledge, (2) innovating data tools and data sharing
pipelines that enable easier sharing of public AV safety data and knowledge;
(3) offsetting costs of curating safety-critical data and incentivizing data
sharing.

Conclusion: 研究为网络科学提供了人类与生成式AI交互的新见解，并建议平台如何支持用户评估机器生成内容。

Abstract: This paper examines how graduate students develop frameworks for evaluating
machine-generated expertise in web-based interactions with large language
models (LLMs). Through a qualitative study combining surveys, LLM interaction
transcripts, and in-depth interviews with 14 graduate students, we identify
patterns in how these emerging professionals assess and engage with
AI-generated content. Our findings reveal that students construct evaluation
frameworks shaped by three main factors: professional identity, verification
capabilities, and system navigation experience. Rather than uniformly accepting
or rejecting LLM outputs, students protect domains central to their
professional identities while delegating others--with managers preserving
conceptual work, designers safeguarding creative processes, and programmers
maintaining control over core technical expertise. These evaluation frameworks
are further influenced by students' ability to verify different types of
content and their experience navigating complex systems. This research
contributes to web science by highlighting emerging human-genAI interaction
patterns and suggesting how platforms might better support users in developing
effective frameworks for evaluating machine-generated expertise signals in
AI-mediated web environments.

Conclusion: 呼吁在GUI代理设计和评估中嵌入隐私和安全考量，增强用户意识。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation through LLM-powered GUI agents, yet their ability to
process sensitive data with limited human oversight raises significant privacy
and security risks. This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI
agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general
autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on
performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We
review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and
outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent
assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation
framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through
in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI
agent design and evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法为云对话AI提供了一种高效资源管理策略，兼顾效率和用户满意度。

Abstract: Generative conversational interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
typically stream output token-by-token at a rate determined by computational
budget, often neglecting actual human reading speeds and the cognitive load
associated with the content. This mismatch frequently leads to inefficient use
of computational resources. For example, in cloud-based services, streaming
content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted
computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly
during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive
streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in
real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the
cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down
the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing
computational resources for other users. Our statistical analysis of
computational savings, combined with crowdsourced user studies, provides
insights into the trade-offs between service efficiency and user satisfaction,
demonstrating that our method can significantly reduce computational
consumption up to 16.8\%. This context-aware computational resource management
strategy presents a practical framework for enhancing system efficiency in
cloud-based conversational AI interfaces without compromising user experience.

Conclusion: 模型表明动作-结果预测、探索、运动噪声和生物启发运动控制是婴儿感知运动学习的关键组成部分。

Abstract: We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine
infants' behavior in the "mobile paradigm". This paradigm has been used in
developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of
their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object
hanging above an infant's crib) is connected to one of the infant's limbs,
prompting the infant to preferentially move that "connected" limb. This ability
to detect a "sensorimotor contingency" is considered to be a foundational
cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor
contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our
model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration,
motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically-inspired motor control.
We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the
literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting
observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the
mobile is disconnected, casting light on a similar occasional finding in
infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate
data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile
that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further
shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction,
exploration, motor noise, and biologically-inspired motor control was essential
for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these
components are also involved in infants' sensorimotor learning.

Result: 实验表明，crypto-ncRNA在效率和可扩展性上优于RSA，且通过NIST SP 800-22随机性测试。

Conclusion: crypto-ncRNA为抵御量子计算威胁提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In the looming post-quantum era, traditional cryptographic systems are
increasingly vulnerable to quantum computing attacks that can compromise their
mathematical foundations. To address this critical challenge, we propose
crypto-ncRNA-a bio-convergent cryptographic framework that leverages the
dynamic folding properties of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) to generate high-entropy,
quantum-resistant keys and produce unpredictable ciphertexts. The framework
employs a novel, multi-stage process: encoding plaintext into RNA sequences,
predicting and manipulating RNA secondary structures using advanced algorithms,
and deriving cryptographic keys through the intrinsic physical unclonability of
RNA molecules. Experimental evaluations indicate that, although crypto-ncRNA's
encryption speed is marginally lower than that of AES, it significantly
outperforms RSA in terms of efficiency and scalability while achieving a 100%
pass rate on the NIST SP 800-22 randomness tests. These results demonstrate
that crypto-ncRNA offers a promising and robust approach for securing digital
infrastructures against the evolving threats posed by quantum computing.

Abstract: Digital systems find it challenging to keep up with cybersecurity threats.
The daily emergence of more than 560,000 new malware strains poses significant
hazards to the digital ecosystem. The traditional malware detection methods
fail to operate properly and yield high false positive rates with low accuracy
of the protection system. This study explores the ways in which malware can be
detected using these machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to
address those shortcomings. This study also includes a systematic comparison of
the performance of some of the widely used ML models, such as random forest,
multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and deep neural network (DNN), for determining
the effectiveness of the domain of modern malware threat systems. We use a
considerable-sized database from Kaggle, which has undergone optimized feature
selection and preprocessing to improve model performance. Our finding suggests
that the DNN model outperformed the other traditional models with the highest
training accuracy of 99.92% and an almost perfect AUC score. Furthermore, the
feature selection and preprocessing can help improve the capabilities of

Abstract: Phishing detection on Ethereum has increasingly leveraged advanced machine

in the context of Ethereum's transactional network. Additionally, we address
key challenges such as class imbalance and dataset composition and their

Conclusion: DiffUMI展示了扩散模型在模型反演中的潜力，为面部识别系统的隐私风险评估提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies
on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To
mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into
embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model
inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these
private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy
risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training
individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive
process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven
universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the
first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in
model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the
need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed
framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse
target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face
recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an
unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search,
enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we
introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the
first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs
based solely on embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在模块化设计下可能泄露隐私的问题，同时避免孤立训练导致的泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用差分隐私和两阶段参数高效微调，结合领域特定低秩适配器和共享提示令牌。

Result: 在CodeXGLUE上实现可证明的隐私保护，有效抵抗成员推理攻击，并在代码补全任务中缩小77%的准确率差距。

Conclusion: NoEsis在隐私保护和知识转移方面表现优异，为模块化语言模型提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are typically trained on vast amounts of data
from various sources. Even when designed modularly (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts),
LLMs can leak privacy on their sources. Conversely, training such models in
isolation arguably prohibits generalization. To this end, we propose a
framework, NoEsis, which builds upon the desired properties of modularity,
privacy, and knowledge transfer. NoEsis integrates differential privacy with a
hybrid two-staged parameter-efficient fine-tuning that combines domain-specific
low-rank adapters, acting as experts, with common prompt tokens, acting as a
knowledge-sharing backbone. Results from our evaluation on CodeXGLUE showcase
that NoEsis can achieve provable privacy guarantees with tangible knowledge
transfer across domains, and empirically show protection against Membership
Inference Attacks. Finally, on code completion tasks, NoEsis bridges at least
77% of the accuracy gap between the non-shared and the non-private baseline.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across
various sectors, cyber security continues to rely on traditional static and
dynamic analysis tools, hampered by high false positive rates and superficial
code comprehension. While generative AI offers promising automation
capabilities for software development, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
for vulnerability detection presents unique challenges. This paper explores the
potential and limitations of LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities, acknowledging
inherent weaknesses such as hallucinations, limited context length, and
knowledge cut-offs. Previous attempts employing machine learning models for
vulnerability detection have proven ineffective due to limited real-world
applicability, feature engineering challenges, lack of contextual
understanding, and the complexities of training models to keep pace with the
evolving threat landscape. Therefore, we propose a robust AI-driven approach
focused on mitigating these limitations and ensuring the quality and
reliability of LLM based vulnerability detection. Through innovative
methodologies combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Mixtureof-Agents (MoA), this research seeks to leverage the strengths of LLMs
while addressing their weaknesses, ultimately paving the way for dependable and
efficient AI-powered solutions in securing the ever-evolving software
landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对固定聚合统计数据的推断攻击方法，尤其是在仅发布少量统计数据时。

Method: 提出DeSIA属性推断攻击框架，并在不同条件下（如噪声添加、统计量数量变化）测试其性能。

Result: DeSIA在识别易受攻击用户时表现优异（真阳性率0.14，假阳性率10^-3），且在无法验证属性的用户中仍表现良好。

Conclusion: 仅靠聚合不足以保护隐私，需结合正式隐私机制和测试后再发布统计数据。

Abstract: Empirical inference attacks are a popular approach for evaluating the privacy
risk of data release mechanisms in practice. While an active attack literature
exists to evaluate machine learning models or synthetic data release, we
currently lack comparable methods for fixed aggregate statistics, in particular
when only a limited number of statistics are released. We here propose an
inference attack framework against fixed aggregate statistics and an attribute
inference attack called DeSIA. We instantiate DeSIA against the U.S. Census
PPMF dataset and show it to strongly outperform reconstruction-based attacks.
In particular, we show DeSIA to be highly effective at identifying vulnerable
users, achieving a true positive rate of 0.14 at a false positive rate of
$10^{-3}$. We then show DeSIA to perform well against users whose attributes
cannot be verified and when varying the number of aggregate statistics and
level of noise addition. We also perform an extensive ablation study of DeSIA
and show how DeSIA can be successfully adapted to the membership inference
task. Overall, our results show that aggregation alone is not sufficient to
protect privacy, even when a relatively small number of aggregates are being
released, and emphasize the need for formal privacy mechanisms and testing
before aggregate statistics are released.

TL;DR: 该研究使用符号回归方法，从历史数据中推导出描述Dst指数时间演化的数据驱动方程，结果显示其模型在大多数情况下优于传统经验模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地磁暴对空间和地面基础设施构成重大风险，Dst指数是量化其强度的关键指标，但现有经验模型存在局限性。

Method: 利用NASA OMNIweb数据库的历史数据，结合PySR框架的符号回归技术，推导出dDst/dt与太阳风参数之间的数学关系。

Result: 符号回归模型在大多数情况下表现出更高的准确性，尤其是中等强度地磁暴，同时保持了物理可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了可解释的闭式表达式，捕捉了Dst演化中的非线性依赖和阈值效应，优于传统模型。

Abstract: Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere
driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and
ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies
geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This
study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing
the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA
OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective
electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an
evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify
mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting
models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with
well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and
O'Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models
demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate
geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance
evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the
2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide
interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and
thresholding effects in Dst evolution.

ground AI development in the social fabric -- the Cloud Weaving Model --
inspired (amongst others) by indigenous knowledge, motifs from nature, and
Eastern traditions. This paper introduces and elaborates on the fundamental
elements of the model (clouds, spiders, threads, spiderwebs, and weather) and
their interpretation in an AI context. The framework is then applied to
comprehend patterns observed in co-creation pilots approaching marginalized
communities, highlighting neglected yet relevant dimensions for responsible AI
development.

TL;DR: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）在推动地理空间人工智能（GeoAI）发展中具有关键作用，提供了更高的适应性和创新性，但也需注意安全与伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开源LLMs如何通过定制化、互操作性和透明度推动地理信息科学（GIScience）的发展，同时应对其潜在风险。

Method: 分析开源与专有LLMs的优缺点，结合案例研究开源模型在地理空间任务中的应用。

Result: 开源LLMs显著提升了GIScience的适应性和创新性，但需加强安全与伦理治理。

Conclusion: GIScience应发展多样化的开源生态系统，结合定制模型与跨学科合作，以负责任的方式推动GeoAI发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming geospatial artificial
intelligence (GeoAI), offering new capabilities in data processing, spatial
analysis, and decision support. This paper examines the open-source paradigm's
pivotal role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer
accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and
transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source
alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience)
by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven
innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate
cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial
indexing), and align with FAIR principles. However, the growing reliance on any
LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical
risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. Ongoing
debates on accessibility, regulation, and misuse underscore the critical need
for responsible AI development strategies. This paper argues that GIScience
advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse,
interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation,
bespoke geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically
evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the
broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a nuanced discourse on
leveraging AI to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and
decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous
manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络与传统参数模型的根本区别，明确其独特性质。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明神经网络在回归任务中对任意变量对总能学习非平凡关系，而参数模型在特定条件下只能学习常数预测器。

Result: 神经网络在缺乏可识别性的情况下仍能学习非平凡关系，而参数模型在可识别性条件下存在无法学习的情况。

Conclusion: 神经网络因缺乏可识别性而在平滑参数模型中具有独特性。

Abstract: One of the enduring problems surrounding neural networks is to identify the
factors that differentiate them from traditional statistical models. We prove a
pair of results which distinguish feedforward neural networks among parametric
models at the population level, for regression tasks. Firstly, we prove that
for any pair of random variables $(X,Y)$, neural networks always learn a
nontrivial relationship between $X$ and $Y$, if one exists. Secondly, we prove
that for reasonable smooth parametric models, under local and global
identifiability conditions, there exists a nontrivial $(X,Y)$ pair for which
the parametric model learns the constant predictor $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. Together,
our results suggest that a lack of identifiability distinguishes neural
networks among the class of smooth parametric models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理大规模图时，计算和内存成本随边数线性增长，效率低下。

Method: 通过低秩分解将图表示为密集的IBG，利用相交二分图组件近似任意图，且秩仅依赖于近似精度。

Result: 证明了弱正则引理的构造性版本，展示了IBG在节点分类、时空图分析和知识图谱补全中的竞争力。

Conclusion: IBG方法显著降低了计算和内存复杂度，适用于大规模图分析。

Abstract: Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional
Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs
scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block
Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on
combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of
communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges,
we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense
IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity
lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its
size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on
the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on
the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity
lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG
representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node
classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion,
while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes
rather than edges.

Method: 提出了MINDcraft平台（用于LLM代理控制Minecraft角色）和MineCollab基准测试，评估具身协作推理的不同维度。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM代理在自然语言沟通方面效率低下，任务完成计划沟通导致性能下降高达15%。

Conclusion: 现有LLM代理在多代理协作（尤其是具身场景）中表现不佳，需探索上下文学习和模仿学习之外的方法。

Abstract: Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from
exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work
studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied
reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible
platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world
game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions
of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the
primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art
agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance
dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task
completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for
multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the
need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning. Our website

<details>

Motivation: 在多任务学习中，潜在右因子向量的推断由于响应矩阵中左右奇异向量的不对称性而更具挑战性。

Method: 提出了SOFARI-R方法，包括强正交和弱正交两种变体：前者通过耦合左奇异向量与设计矩阵并重新缩放生成新流形，后者通过硬阈值SOFARI估计并纳入近似误差。

Result: 两种变体均生成偏差校正的潜在右因子向量估计，具有渐近正态分布和合理的渐近方差估计。

Conclusion: 通过仿真研究和经济应用验证了SOFARI-R方法的有效性。

Abstract: Data reduction with uncertainty quantification plays a key role in various
multi-task learning applications, where large numbers of responses and features
are present. To this end, a general framework of high-dimensional
manifold-based SOFAR inference (SOFARI) was introduced recently in Zheng, Zhou,
Fan and Lv (2024) for interpretable multi-task learning inference focusing on
the left factor vectors and singular values exploiting the latent singular
value decomposition (SVD) structure. Yet, designing a valid inference procedure
on the latent right factor vectors is not straightforward from that of the left
ones and can be even more challenging due to asymmetry of left and right
singular vectors in the response matrix. To tackle these issues, in this paper
we suggest a new method of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference for
latent responses (SOFARI-R), where two variants of SOFARI-R are introduced. The
first variant deals with strongly orthogonal factors by coupling left singular
vectors with the design matrix and then appropriately rescaling them to
generate new Stiefel manifolds. The second variant handles the more general
weakly orthogonal factors by employing the hard-thresholded SOFARI estimates
and delicately incorporating approximation errors into the distribution. Both
variants produce bias-corrected estimators for the latent right factor vectors
that enjoy asymptotically normal distributions with justified asymptotic
variance estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly suggested
method using extensive simulation studies and an economic application.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a
fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories,
where analytic tools often fall short. Challenges arise when one takes the
continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the
presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent
advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this
area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field

former. The notes are based on the lectures given by the first author in

Abstract: Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to
understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools
for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial
intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on
binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a
novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose
an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein
dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface
(FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this
sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein
dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this
dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant
generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation
trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a
significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate
its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein
interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to
encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel
applications in pathway prediction.

Motivation: 现有的遍历覆盖方法受限于可用的遍历度量，限制了性能。本文旨在通过流匹配技术解决这一问题。

Method: 通过流匹配技术将遍历覆盖问题转化为线性二次调节器问题，并支持生成推理中的替代遍历度量。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在性能和计算效率上的提升，并在非线性动力学和机器人任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 基于流匹配的遍历覆盖方法克服了现有方法的限制，提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied
agents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a
target distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is
measured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are
constrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control
synthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose
an alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique
widely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We
formally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it
is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form
solution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative
inference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were
previously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no
computational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational
gradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the
target distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on
the other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an
optimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on
non-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved
performance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through
comprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We
further demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing
and erasing tasks on a Franka robot.

Abstract: Task and motion planning is a well-established approach for solving
long-horizon robot planning problems. However, traditional methods assume that
each task-level robot action, or skill, can be reduced to kinematic motion
planning. In this work, we address the challenge of planning with both
kinematic skills and closed-loop motor controllers that go beyond kinematic
considerations. We propose a novel method that integrates these controllers
into motion planning using Composable Interaction Primitives (CIPs), enabling
the use of diverse, non-composable pre-learned skills in hierarchical robot
planning. Toward validating our Task and Skill Planning (TASP) approach, we
describe ongoing robot experiments in real-world scenarios designed to
demonstrate how CIPs can allow a mobile manipulator robot to effectively
combine motion planning with general-purpose skills to accomplish complex
tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous system simulation platforms have significantly
enhanced the safe and scalable testing of driving policies. However, existing
simulators do not yet fully meet the needs of future transportation research,
particularly in modeling socially-aware driving agents and enabling effective
human-AI collaboration. This paper introduces Sky-Drive, a novel distributed
multi-agent simulation platform that addresses these limitations through four
key innovations: (a) a distributed architecture for synchronized simulation
across multiple terminals; (b) a multi-modal human-in-the-loop framework
integrating diverse sensors to collect rich behavioral data; (c) a human-AI
collaboration mechanism supporting continuous and adaptive knowledge exchange;
and (d) a digital twin (DT) framework for constructing high-fidelity virtual
replicas of real-world transportation environments. Sky-Drive supports diverse
applications such as autonomous vehicle (AV)-vulnerable road user (VRU)
interaction modeling, human-in-the-loop training, socially-aware reinforcement
learning, personalized driving policy, and customized scenario generation.
Future extensions will incorporate foundation models for context-aware decision
support and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing for real-world validation. By
bridging scenario generation, data collection, algorithm training, and hardware
integration, Sky-Drive has the potential to become a foundational platform for

resource-intensive. While collaboration between the two offers a promising
solution, the key challenge is deciding when and how to engage the large model.
To address this issue, this paper proposes opportunistic collaborative planning
(OCP), which seamlessly integrates efficient local models with powerful cloud
models through two key innovations. First, we propose large vision model guided
model predictive control (LVM-MPC), which leverages the cloud for LVM
perception and decision making. The cloud output serves as a global guidance
for a local MPC, thereby forming a closed-loop perception-to-control system.
Second, to determine the best timing for large model query and service, we
propose collaboration timing optimization (CTO), including object detection
confidence thresholding (ODCT) and cloud forward simulation (CFS), to decide
when to seek cloud assistance and when to offer cloud service. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed OCP outperforms existing methods in terms of
both navigation time and success rate.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习和高斯过程回归的框架，用于解决自主水面车辆在浅水环境中的导航问题，通过稀疏声纳数据逐步构建深度地图，提升导航安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主水面车辆在浅水环境中导航面临动态干扰和深度限制的挑战，传统方法因传感器信息有限而难以实现安全高效操作。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合高斯过程回归，利用单波束回声测深仪的稀疏数据逐步估计深度地图，提升环境感知能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效提升导航性能，并在模拟到现实的迁移中表现良好。

Conclusion: 所提框架在浅水环境中实现了安全高效的自主导航，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) play a crucial role in maritime
operations, yet their navigation in shallow-water environments remains
challenging due to dynamic disturbances and depth constraints. Traditional
navigation strategies struggle with limited sensor information, making safe and
efficient operation difficult. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for ASV navigation under depth constraints, where the
vehicle must reach a target while avoiding unsafe areas with only a single
depth measurement per timestep from a downward-facing Single Beam Echosounder
(SBES). To enhance environmental awareness, we integrate Gaussian Process (GP)
regression into the RL framework, enabling the agent to progressively estimate
a bathymetric depth map from sparse sonar readings. This approach improves
decision-making by providing a richer representation of the environment.
Furthermore, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that
trained policies generalize well to real-world aquatic conditions. Experimental
results validate our method's capability to improve ASV navigation performance
while maintaining safety in challenging shallow-water environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视觉模仿学习方法CIVIL，通过结合人类标记和语言提示，帮助机器人理解任务相关特征，从而在环境变化时更好地完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉模仿学习方法仅模仿人类行为，而忽略了行为背后的决策特征，导致机器人在环境变化时表现不佳。

Method: 提出CIVIL算法，利用人类标记和语言提示提取任务相关特征，并训练基于Transformer的策略。

Result: 实验表明，CIVIL在模拟、真实世界和用户研究中表现优于现有方法，尤其在未见过的场景中。

Conclusion: CIVIL通过结合人类反馈，显著提升了机器人在视觉模仿学习中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Today's robots learn new tasks by imitating human examples. However, this
standard approach to visual imitation learning is fundamentally limited: the
robot observes what the human does, but not why the human chooses those
behaviors. Without understanding the features that factor into the human's
decisions, robot learners often misinterpret the data and fail to perform the
task when the environment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective:
instead of asking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should
take, we also enable humans to indicate task-relevant features using markers
and language prompts. Our proposed algorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented
data to filter the robot's visual observations and extract a feature
representation that causally informs human actions. CIVIL then applies these
causal features to train a transformer-based policy that emulates human
behaviors without being confused by visual distractors. Our simulations,
real-world experiments, and user study demonstrate that robots trained with
CIVIL can learn from fewer human demonstrations and perform better than
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in previously unseen scenarios. See

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理的机器学习框架（PnP-PIML），通过结合共形预测和分布式Port-Hamiltonian系统（dPHS），解决数据驱动预测在分布外场景中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人应用中，预测周围物体轨迹至关重要。数据驱动方法在未知动态场景中常用，但在分布外数据时性能下降。

Method: 使用共形预测识别异常动态，并切换到基于物理的dPHS模型。通过高斯过程建模dPHS的能量函数，学习动态并量化不确定性。

Result: 框架在分布外场景中仍能提供可靠的物理一致性预测。

Conclusion: PnP-PIML框架结合了数据驱动和物理模型，提升了预测的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: The ability to predict trajectories of surrounding agents and obstacles is a
crucial component in many robotic applications. Data-driven approaches are
commonly adopted for state prediction in scenarios where the underlying
dynamics are unknown. However, the performance, reliability, and uncertainty of
data-driven predictors become compromised when encountering out-of-distribution
observations relative to the training data. In this paper, we introduce a
Plug-and-Play Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PnP-PIML) framework to address
this challenge. Our method employs conformal prediction to identify outlier
dynamics and, in that case, switches from a nominal predictor to a
physics-consistent model, namely distributed Port-Hamiltonian systems (dPHS).
We leverage Gaussian processes to model the energy function of the dPHS,
enabling not only the learning of system dynamics but also the quantification
of predictive uncertainty through its Bayesian nature. In this way, the
proposed framework produces reliable physics-informed predictions even for the
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 解决机器人持续学习中动力学模型优化的问题，包括安全适应、灾难性遗忘、异常管理、数据效率等挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人持续学习提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning in robotics seeks systems that can constantly adapt to
changing environments and tasks, mirroring human adaptability. A key challenge
is refining dynamics models, essential for planning and control, while
addressing issues such as safe adaptation, catastrophic forgetting, outlier
management, data efficiency, and balancing exploration with exploitation -- all
within task and onboard resource constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a
generative framework leveraging flow matching for online robot dynamics model
alignment. Rather than executing actions based on a misaligned model, our
approach refines planned actions to better match with those the robot would
take if its model was well aligned. We find that by transforming the actions
themselves rather than exploring with a misaligned model -- as is traditionally
done -- the robot collects informative data more efficiently, thereby
accelerating learning. Moreover, we validate that the method can handle an
evolving and possibly imperfect model while reducing, if desired, the
dependency on replay buffers or legacy model snapshots. We validate our
approach using two platforms: an unmanned ground vehicle and a quadrotor. The
results highlight the method's adaptability and efficiency, with a record
34.2\% higher task success rate, demonstrating its potential towards enabling
continual robot learning. Code:

*Raza Ul Mustafa,Sesha Dassanayake*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 研究探讨了YouTube视频流中质量切换（如分辨率变化）与信道指标（RSRP、RSRQ、SNR）的关系，发现它们正相关，并提出利用这些指标预测分辨率变化以优化用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QoS指标（如带宽、延迟）不足以提升OTT平台的用户体验，因此研究探索了信道指标与视频质量切换的关系。

Method: 通过分析YouTube流媒体会话中的质量切换与RSRP、RSRQ、SNR的关系，并利用传统机器学习分类器进行预测。

Result: 研究发现信道指标与质量切换正相关，机器学习模型预测准确率达77%。

Conclusion: 在5G及未来网络中，该方法可帮助OTT平台优化资源分配，提升用户体验。

Abstract: The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a
video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube
reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift
events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is
frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts
ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion
score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve
continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are
looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on
traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and
throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting
in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our
findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts.
Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming
sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more
resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML)
classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP,
RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency
networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can
be used to improve OTT services.

Abstract: Identification of defects or anomalies in 3D objects is a crucial task to
ensure correct functionality. In this work, we combine Bayesian learning with
recent developments in quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning,
specifically orthogonal neural networks, to tackle this anomaly detection
problem for an industrially relevant use case. Bayesian learning enables
uncertainty quantification of predictions, while orthogonality in weight
matrices enables smooth training. We develop orthogonal (quantum) versions of
3D convolutional neural networks and show that these models can successfully
detect anomalies in 3D objects. To test the feasibility of incorporating
quantum computers into a quantum-enhanced anomaly detection pipeline, we
perform hardware experiments with our models on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane
device, testing the effect of noise and limited measurement shots.

TL;DR: EduBot是一个基于LLMs的智能编程助手系统，通过递归提示驱动方法解决复杂编程任务，无需微调LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练LLMs在多步推理和代码生成中的潜力，解决个性化编程任务。

Method: 结合概念教学、端到端代码开发、递归提示驱动方法和有限人工干预的调试。

Result: EduBot能在20分钟内完成大多数复杂编程任务，兼容不同能力的LLMs。

Conclusion: EduBot展示了LLMs在解决多步编程任务中的潜力，为个性化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing the process
of writing code. General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in
generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot
queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with
recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we
propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines
conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized
programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited
human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated
programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging
from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven
systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's
performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios
in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that
EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the
benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the
backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with
varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to
explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code
generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and
code generation.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从RFC文档生成协议规范，解决网络协议实现验证中的oracle和traceability问题，并检测出69个bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议实现的正确性验证存在oracle（如何判定实现有bug）和traceability（如何追踪bug来源）两大难题，现有方法很少同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 通过LLMs将RFC文档转化为形式化协议规范，作为quasi-oracle验证协议解析器，同时通过验证结果逐步优化oracle。

Result: 在9种网络协议的C、Python和Go实现中检测出69个bug，其中36个已确认，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 展示了基于自然语言规范自动化软件验证的潜力，减少了传统手动验证的依赖。

Abstract: Validating the correctness of network protocol implementations is highly
challenging due to the oracle and traceability problems. The former determines
when a protocol implementation can be considered buggy, especially when the
bugs do not cause any observable symptoms. The latter allows developers to
understand how an implementation violates the protocol specification, thereby
facilitating bug fixes. Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems
into account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using
recent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that
network protocols are often released with structured specification documents,
a.k.a. RFC documents, which can be systematically translated to formal protocol
message specifications via LLMs. Such specifications, which may contain errors
due to the hallucination of LLMs, are used as a quasi-oracle to validate
protocol parsers, while the validation results in return gradually refine the
oracle. Since the oracle is derived from the document, any bugs we find in a
protocol implementation can be traced back to the document, thus addressing the
traceability problem. We have extensively evaluated our approach using nine
network protocols and their implementations written in C, Python, and Go. The
results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and has
detected 69 bugs, with 36 confirmed. The project also demonstrates the
potential for fully automating software validation based on natural language
specifications, a process previously considered predominantly manual due to the
need to understand specification documents and derive expected outputs for test
inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理虽能提升LLM调试能力，但固定数量代理会增加成本和分散注意力，需动态调整以适应任务特性。

Method: 设计自适应代理架构，根据任务复杂度动态生成代理数量和角色，无需预定义。

Result: 代理数量随代码复杂度变化，简单问题仅需1个代理，复杂问题生成更多代理，修复效果平均提升11%。

Conclusion: 自适应设计在多代理调试中表现优异，未来可进一步优化以实现自主规划和执行软件目标。

Abstract: Using multiple agents was found to improve the debugging capabilities of
Large Language Models. However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several
drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the
agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design,
where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on
the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents
roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be
solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number
of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In
fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed
using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the
creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix,
we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting.
Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve
our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct
their software goals.

Method: 基于定向3D边界框表示，结合空间谓词（拓扑、连通性、方向性等），构建空间知识图，并通过管道推理模型支持动态规则评估。

Result: 框架能够高效地将几何数据转化为可操作知识，支持复杂3D环境中的可扩展空间推理，并与机器学习、自然语言处理等技术无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该框架为XR应用中的空间推理提供了高效且技术无关的解决方案，推动了空间本体论的创建。

Abstract: Modern extended reality XR systems provide rich analysis of image data and
fusion of sensor input and demand AR/VR applications that can reason about 3D
scenes in a semantic manner. We present a spatial reasoning framework that
bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key
tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on',
'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box
representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging
from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in
a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial
knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model,
enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client-
and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to
efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring
scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D
environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of
spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches
machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR
applications.

routine coding tasks (e.g., refactoring and Javadoc generation) but face
challenges in complex, domain-specific activities due to limited

Motivation: RTS是北极地区重要的永久冻土地貌，其出现是永久冻土融化的明显标志。然而，由于其小尺度、模糊边界和时空变化，准确检测RTS具有挑战性。

Method: 采用Cascade Mask R-CNN模型，结合多尺度视觉Transformer骨干网络，并引入两种新策略：特征级残差跨模态注意力融合和预训练单模态学习后多模态微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在RTS检测中优于现有模型，提供了多模态数据高效利用的新见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为永久冻土地貌及其环境影响的理解提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost
landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial
because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw.
However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague
boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for
accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning
model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based
backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were
introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive
performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion
strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to
capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand
complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal
learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand
while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated
that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion,
feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies,
providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data
for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost
landforms and their environmental implications.

Result: 实验表明，DPIR在图像修复性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPIR通过双提示和多视角条件提取，为图像修复提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art image restoration methods mostly adopt latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones, yet still facing challenges in achieving
high-quality restoration due to their limited capabilities. Diffusion
transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because
of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR
(Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that
effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple
perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image
conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch
utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with
high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration,
textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics.
Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional
visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted
global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual
prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image
restoration performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Vid-LLMs在视频编辑理解（VEU）任务中的能力尚未被探索，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建VEU-Bench基准测试，涵盖19个细粒度任务，并开发了自动标注流程和Oscars模型。

Result: 实验显示现有Vid-LLMs在VEU任务中表现不佳，而Oscars模型在准确率上提升了28.3%，且VEU数据能提升Vid-LLMs在通用视频理解任务中的性能。

Conclusion: VEU-Bench和Oscars模型为视频编辑理解任务提供了新的基准和解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Widely shared videos on the internet are often edited. Recently, although
Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general
video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding
(VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce
VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark
that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from
intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types
and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that
focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19
fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To
enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline
integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments
with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs
face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than
random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model
fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing
open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves
performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate
that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs
on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3%
across nine reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像去雾在遥感应用中很重要，但现有模型的可靠性未充分分析，易受对抗噪声影响。

Method: 提出两种轻量级微调策略，增强预训练Transformer模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 即使1像素变化也能显著降低PSNR（2.8 dB），但微调后模型在对抗数据下表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 微调策略在保持性能的同时提高了对抗噪声的鲁棒性，适用于遥感场景。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing is an important topic in remote sensing applications,
enhancing the quality of acquired images and increasing object detection
precision. However, the reliability of such structures has not been
sufficiently analyzed, which poses them to the risk of imperceptible
perturbations that can significantly hinder their performance. In this work, we
show that state-of-the-art image-to-image dehazing transformers are susceptible
to adversarial noise, with even 1 pixel change being able to decrease the PSNR
by as much as 2.8 dB. Next, we propose two lightweight fine-tuning strategies
aimed at increasing the robustness of pre-trained transformers. Our methods
results in comparable clean performance, while significantly increasing the
protection against adversarial data. We further present their applicability in
two remote sensing scenarios, showcasing their robust behavior for
out-of-distribution data. The source code for adversarial fine-tuning and
attack algorithms can be found at github.com/Vladimirescu/RobustDehazing.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has driven
advancements in cross-modal reasoning but at significant computational costs.
In this work, we focus on visual language models. We highlight the redundancy
and inefficiency in current vision encoders, and seek to construct an adaptive
compression method for multimodal data. In this work, we characterize a panoply
of visual token selection and merging approaches through both benchmarking and
qualitative analysis. In particular, we demonstrate that simple cluster-level
token aggregation outperforms prior state-of-the-art works in token selection
and merging, including merging at the vision encoder level and attention-based
approaches. We underline the redundancy in current vision encoders, and shed
light on several puzzling trends regarding principles of visual token selection
through cross-modal attention visualizations. This work is a first effort
towards more effective encoding and processing of high-dimensional data, and
paves the way for more scalable and sustainable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Assessing the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal AI systems can
effectively measure their understanding and reasoning abilities. Most video
evaluation benchmarks are limited to a single language, typically English, and
predominantly feature videos rooted in Western cultural contexts. In this
paper, we present VideoVista-CulturalLingo, the first video evaluation
benchmark designed to bridge cultural, linguistic, and domain divide in video
comprehension. Our work differs from existing benchmarks in the following ways:
1) Cultural diversity, incorporating cultures from China, North America, and
Europe; 2) Multi-linguistics, with questions presented in Chinese and
English-two of the most widely spoken languages; and 3) Broad domain, featuring
videos sourced from hundreds of human-created domains. VideoVista-CulturalLingo
contains 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs, and we have evaluated 24 recent
open-source or proprietary video large models. From the experiment results, we
observe that: 1) Existing models perform worse on Chinese-centric questions
than Western-centric ones, particularly those related to Chinese history; 2)
Current open-source models still exhibit limitations in temporal understanding,
especially in the Event Localization task, achieving a maximum score of only
45.2%; 3) Mainstream models demonstrate strong performance in general
scientific questions, while open-source models demonstrate weak performance in
mathematics.

TL;DR: CAMU框架通过结合视觉语言模型和参数高效微调，显著提升了社交媒体模因中的仇恨内容检测性能，并在多个数据集上达到先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体模因结合了视觉和文本线索，具有文化复杂性，传统方法难以有效检测仇恨内容。CAMU旨在通过多模态理解和高效微调解决这一问题。

Method: CAMU利用大型视觉语言模型生成描述性标题，通过标题评分神经网络突出仇恨相关内容，并高效微调CLIP文本编码器以提升多模态理解。

Result: 在Hateful Memes数据集上，CAMU达到0.807的准确率和0.806的F1分数，与现有最优方法相当但更高效；在MultiOFF数据集上F1分数为0.673。

Conclusion: CAMU展示了在多模态仇恨内容检测中的高效性和泛化能力，强调视觉基础和文本表示对可靠检测的重要性。

Abstract: Social media memes are a challenging domain for hate detection because they
intertwine visual and textual cues into culturally nuanced messages. We
introduce a novel framework, CAMU, which leverages large vision-language models
to generate more descriptive captions, a caption-scoring neural network to
emphasise hate-relevant content, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of CLIP's
text encoder for an improved multimodal understanding of memes. Experiments on
publicly available hateful meme datasets show that simple projection layer
fine-tuning yields modest gains, whereas selectively tuning deeper text encoder
layers significantly boosts performance on all evaluation metrics. Moreover,
our approach attains high accuracy (0.807) and F1-score (0.806) on the Hateful
Memes dataset, at par with the existing SoTA framework while being much more
efficient, offering practical advantages in real-world scenarios that rely on
fixed decision thresholds. CAMU also achieves the best F1-score of 0.673 on the
MultiOFF dataset for offensive meme identification, demonstrating its
generalisability. Additional analyses on benign confounders reveal that robust
visual grounding and nuanced text representations are crucial for reliable hate
and offence detection. We will publicly release CAMU along with the resultant
models for further research.
  Disclaimer: This paper includes references to potentially disturbing,
hateful, or offensive content due to the nature of the task.

Method: 系统结合LVLM和分割模型，通过长按、点击或双击屏幕获取场景描述、物体分类及详细信息，并利用RGB图像分割结果减少LVLM的幻觉。

Result: 在POPE、MME和LLaVA-QA90上的实验表明，系统比Qwen-VL-Chat提供更准确的场景描述；探索性实验证实其有效帮助视障人士感知环境。

Conclusion: 该系统通过技术整合显著提升了视障人士的环境感知能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: It is a challenging task for visually impaired people to perceive their
surrounding environment due to the complexity of the natural scenes. Their
personal and social activities are thus highly limited. This paper introduces a
Large Vision-Language Model(LVLM) based environment perception system which
helps them to better understand the surrounding environment, by capturing the
current scene they face with a wearable device, and then letting them retrieve
the analysis results through the device. The visually impaired people could
acquire a global description of the scene by long pressing the screen to
activate the LVLM output, retrieve the categories of the objects in the scene
resulting from a segmentation model by tapping or swiping the screen, and get a
detailed description of the objects they are interested in by double-tapping
the screen. To help visually impaired people more accurately perceive the
world, this paper proposes incorporating the segmentation result of the RGB
image as external knowledge into the input of LVLM to reduce the LVLM's
hallucination. Technical experiments on POPE, MME and LLaVA-QA90 show that the
system could provide a more accurate description of the scene compared to
Qwen-VL-Chat, exploratory experiments show that the system helps visually
impaired people to perceive the surrounding environment effectively.

Abstract: Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health challenge, yet
traditional diagnosis methods and existing single-eye deep learning approaches
often fail to account for binocular pathological correlations. To address this,
we propose DMS-Net, a dual-modal multi-scale Siamese network for binocular
fundus image classification. Our framework leverages weight-shared Siamese
ResNet-152 backbones to extract deep semantic features from paired fundus
images. To tackle challenges such as lesion boundary ambiguity and scattered
pathological distributions, we introduce a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Module
(MSCAM) that integrates adaptive pooling and attention mechanisms for
multi-resolution feature aggregation. Additionally, a Dual-Modal Feature Fusion
(DMFF) module enhances cross-modal interaction through spatial-semantic
recalibration and bidirectional attention, effectively combining global context
and local edge features. Evaluated on the ODIR-5K dataset, DMS-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.5% accuracy, 86.1% recall, and 83.8%
Cohen's kappa, demonstrating superior capability in detecting symmetric
pathologies and advancing clinical decision-making for ocular diseases.

Abstract: In the field of medical imaging, the advent of deep learning, especially the
application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has revolutionized the
analysis and interpretation of medical images. Nevertheless, deep learning
methods usually rely on large amounts of labeled data. In medical imaging
research, the acquisition of high-quality labels is both expensive and
difficult. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) and self-supervised
learning provides a pre-training strategy that utilizes abundant unlabeled
data, effectively alleviating the label acquisition challenge while broadening
the breadth of data utilization. However, ViT's high computational density and
substantial demand for computing power, coupled with the lack of localization
characteristics of its operations on image patches, limit its efficiency and
applicability in many application scenarios. In this study, we employ
nn-MobileNet, a lightweight CNN framework, to implement a BERT-style
self-supervised learning approach. We pre-train the network on the unlabeled
retinal fundus images from the UK Biobank to improve downstream application
performance. We validate the results of the pre-trained model on Alzheimer's
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and various retinal diseases
identification. The results show that our approach can significantly improve
performance in the downstream tasks. In summary, this study combines the
benefits of CNNs with the capabilities of advanced self-supervised learning in
handling large-scale unlabeled data, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in the
presence of label scarcity.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential
for advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a
significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D
spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present
three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of
heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State
Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses
contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and
comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a
global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear
assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We
propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI
pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus
improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such
as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation
through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal
dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations
of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art
performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best
by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness
and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks. The code and models are available at

Result: 在Intentonomy和MDID数据集上达到最先进性能，准确性显著提升且具有良好可解释性。

Conclusion: MCCL为理解复杂人类表达形式提供了新思路，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: In an era where social media platforms abound, individuals frequently share
images that offer insights into their intents and interests, impacting
individual life quality and societal stability. Traditional computer vision
tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete
visual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual
clues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such
clues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract
concepts, e.g. "enjoy life". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by
manually designing representative features or building prototypes for each
class from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with
the large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL)
to address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages
the systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent
recognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained
features. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We
treat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph
convolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding
correlations. Demonstrated by a state-of-the-art performance on the Intentonomy
and MDID datasets, our approach advances the accuracy of existing methods while
also possessing good interpretability. Our work provides an attempt for future
explorations in understanding complex and miscellaneous forms of human
expression.

(AV-GAS) for generating images from soundscapes (mixed audio containing
multiple classes). Our contribution is threefold: First, we propose a new
challenge in the audio-visual generation task, which is to generate an image
given a multi-class audio input, and we propose a method that solves this task
using an audio-visual separator. Second, we introduce a new audio-visual
separation task, which involves generating separate images for each class
present in a mixed audio input. Lastly, we propose new evaluation metrics for
the audio-visual generation task: Class Representation Score (CRS) and a
modified R@K. Our model is trained and evaluated on the VGGSound dataset. We
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving 7% higher CRS
and 4% higher R@2* in generating plausible images with mixed audio.

Conclusion: 合成数据和动态图库更新显著提升老化重识别性能，并发布了开源数据集pallet-block-2696。

Abstract: This contribution explores the impact of synthetic training data usage and
the prediction of material wear and aging in the context of re-identification.
Different experimental setups and gallery set expanding strategies are tested,
analyzing their impact on performance over time for aging re-identification
subjects. Using a continuously updating gallery, we were able to increase our
mean Rank-1 accuracy by 24%, as material aging was taken into account step by
step. In addition, using models trained with 10% artificial training data,
Rank-1 accuracy could be increased by up to 13%, in comparison to a model
trained on only real-world data, significantly boosting generalized performance
on hold-out data. Finally, this work introduces a novel, open-source
re-identification dataset, pallet-block-2696. This dataset contains 2,696
images of Euro pallets, taken over a period of 4 months. During this time,
natural aging processes occurred and some of the pallets were damaged during
their usage. These wear and tear processes significantly changed the appearance
of the pallets, providing a dataset that can be used to generate synthetically
aged pallets or other wooden materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中固定损失权重的设置未考虑任务重要性和训练过程动态变化，影响了隐写任务的性能。

Method: TSCL分为两阶段：先验课程控制和损失动态控制，分别调整模型学习重点和任务学习速度。

Result: 在ALASKA2、VOC2012和ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，TSCL显著提升了隐写质量、解码准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: TSCL通过动态损失权重调整，有效优化了深度学习图像隐写算法的性能。

Abstract: For deep learning-based image steganography frameworks, in order to ensure
the invisibility and recoverability of the information embedding, the loss
function usually contains several losses such as embedding loss, recovery loss
and steganalysis loss. In previous research works, fixed loss weights are
usually chosen for training optimization, and this setting is not linked to the
importance of the steganography task itself and the training process. In this
paper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for
balancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.
TSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics
control. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information
embedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the
multi-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its
learning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the
model learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to
steganalysis. In the second stage, the learning speed of each training task is
evaluated by calculating the loss drop of the before and after iteration rounds
to balance the learning of each task. Experimental results on three large
public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed TSCL
strategy improves the quality of steganography, decoding accuracy and security.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image manipulation have achieved unprecedented
progress in generating photorealistic content, but also simultaneously
eliminating barriers to arbitrary manipulation and editing, raising concerns
about multimedia authenticity and cybersecurity. However, existing Image
Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL) methodologies predominantly
focus on splicing or copy-move forgeries, lacking dedicated benchmarks for
inpainting-based manipulations. To bridge this gap, we present COCOInpaint, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for inpainting detection, with
three key contributions: 1) High-quality inpainting samples generated by six
state-of-the-art inpainting models, 2) Diverse generation scenarios enabled by
four mask generation strategies with optional text guidance, and 3) Large-scale
coverage with 258,266 inpainted images with rich semantic diversity. Our
benchmark is constructed to emphasize intrinsic inconsistencies between
inpainted and authentic regions, rather than superficial semantic artifacts
such as object shapes. We establish a rigorous evaluation protocol using three
standard metrics to assess existing IMDL approaches. The dataset will be made
publicly available to facilitate future research in this area.

Abstract: We present a new way to detect 3D objects from multimodal inputs, leveraging
both LiDAR and RGB cameras in a hybrid late-cascade scheme, that combines an
RGB detection network and a 3D LiDAR detector. We exploit late fusion
principles to reduce LiDAR False Positives, matching LiDAR detections with RGB
ones by projecting the LiDAR bounding boxes on the image. We rely on cascade
fusion principles to recover LiDAR False Negatives leveraging epipolar
constraints and frustums generated by RGB detections of separate views. Our
solution can be plugged on top of any underlying single-modal detectors,
enabling a flexible training process that can take advantage of pre-trained
LiDAR and RGB detectors, or train the two branches separately. We evaluate our
results on the KITTI object detection benchmark, showing significant
performance improvements, especially for the detection of Pedestrians and
Cyclists.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有深度子空间聚类方法的局限性，具有更高的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering (DSC) algorithms face several challenges that hinder
their widespread adoption across variois application domains. First, clustering
quality is typically assessed using only the encoder's output layer,
disregarding valuable information present in the intermediate layers. Second,
most DSC approaches treat representation learning and subspace clustering as
independent tasks, limiting their effectiveness. Third, they assume the
availability of a held-out dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which is often
impractical in real-world scenarios. Fourth, learning termination is commonly
based on clustering error monitoring, requiring external labels. Finally, their
performance often depends on post-processing techniques that rely on labeled
data. To address this limitations, we introduce a novel single-view DSC
approach that: (i) minimizes a layer-wise self expression loss using a joint
representation matrix; (ii) optimizes a subspace-structured norm to enhance
clustering quality; (iii) employs a multi-stage sequential learning framework,
consisting of pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling the use of multiple
regularization terms without hyperparameter tuning; (iv) incorporates a
relative error-based self-stopping mechanism to terminate training without
labels; and (v) retains a fixed number of leading coefficients in the learned
representation matrix based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the proposed method
on six datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. The results show that
our method outperforms most linear SC algorithms with careffulyl tuned
hyperparameters while maintaining competitive performance with the best
performing linear appoaches.

Abstract: Railway systems, particularly in Germany, require high levels of automation
to address legacy infrastructure challenges and increase train traffic safely.
A key component of automation is robust long-range perception, essential for
early hazard detection, such as obstacles at level crossings or pedestrians on
tracks. Unlike automotive systems with braking distances of ~70 meters, trains
require perception ranges exceeding 1 km. This paper presents an
deep-learning-based approach for long-range 3D object detection tailored for
autonomous trains. The method relies solely on monocular images, inspired by
the Faraway-Frustum approach, and incorporates LiDAR data during training to
improve depth estimation. The proposed pipeline consists of four key modules:
(1) a modified YOLOv9 for 2.5D object detection, (2) a depth estimation
network, and (3-4) dedicated short- and long-range 3D detection heads.
Evaluations on the OSDaR23 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in detecting objects up to 250 meters. Results highlight its potential
for railway automation and outline areas for future improvement.

Motivation: 事件相机能够捕捉场景中的变化信号，适合用于运动估计。将事件数据分类为不同运动（即运动分割）对物体检测和视觉伺服等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种迭代运动分割方法，将事件分类为背景（主导运动假设）和前景（独立运动残差），扩展了对比度最大化框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在公开和自录数据集上成功分类事件簇，生成清晰的运动补偿边缘图像，并在运动物体检测基准上实现了超过30%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了对比度最大化对运动参数和输入事件的敏感性，为基于事件的运动分割估计提供了理论进展。

Abstract: Event cameras provide rich signals that are suitable for motion estimation
since they respond to changes in the scene. As any visual changes in the scene
produce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions
(i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object
detection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation
method, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion
hypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the
Contrast Maximization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method successfully classifies event clusters both for public and
self-recorded datasets, producing sharp, motion-compensated edge-like images.
The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on moving object
detection benchmarks with an improvement of over 30%, and demonstrates its
possibility of applying to more complex and noisy real-world scenes. We hope
this work broadens the sensitivity of Contrast Maximization with respect to
both motion parameters and input events, thus contributing to theoretical
advancements in event-based motion segmentation estimation.

Result: FAR比MAR推理速度快2.3倍，同时保持竞争力的FID和IS分数。

Conclusion: FAR首次实现了高效自回归的高保真连续空间图像生成，填补了视觉自回归建模中质量与可扩展性的关键空白。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data
generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image
generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked
autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token
distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow
inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising
process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a
novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut
head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive
principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers,
extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring
architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves
$2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS
scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for
high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap
between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving cloud platforms and the escalating complexity of network
traffic demand proper network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection to
ensure network security and performance. This paper introduces a large language
model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In
addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness
the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network
traffic, which allows us a better capture of underlying complex patterns, as
well as slight fluctuations in the dataset. We show for a given detection task,
the need for a hybrid model that incorporates the attention mechanism of the
transformer architecture into a supervised learning framework in order to
achieve better accuracy. A pre-trained large language model analyzes and
predicts the probable network traffic, and an anomaly detection layer that
considers temporality and context is added. Moreover, we present a novel
transfer learning-based methodology to enhance the model's effectiveness to
quickly adapt to unknown network structures and adversarial conditions without
requiring extensive labeled datasets. Actual results show that the designed
model outperforms traditional methods in detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, effectively identify various network anomalies such as zero-day
attacks and traffic congestion pattern, and significantly reduce the false
positive rate.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a significant
interest in deploying LLMempowered algorithms for wireless communication

RIC (near-RT RIC) components enabling intelligent resource management across
different time scales. In this paper, we propose the LLM empowered hierarchical
RIC (LLM-hRIC) framework to improve the collaboration between RICs. This
framework integrates LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient
network resource management. In this framework, LLMs-empowered non-RT RICs
provide strategic guidance and high-level policies based on environmental
context. Concurrently, RL-empowered near-RT RICs perform low-latency tasks
based on strategic guidance and local near-RT observation. We evaluate the
LLM-hRIC framework in an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network setting.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior
performance. Finally, we discuss the key future challenges in applying LLMs to
O-RAN.

Motivation: 传统集合卡尔曼滤波（EnKF）使用高斯假设限制了准确性，需要一种更灵活的方法来逼近滤波分布。

Method: 提出MNMEF方法，利用MNM作为神经算子处理概率分布输入，结合集合变换器实现不同规模的集合应用。

Result: MNMEF在Lorenz 96和Kuramoto-Sivashinsky模型中表现出更低的均方根误差。

Conclusion: MNMEF通过神经算子改进了滤波精度，适用于不同规模的集合，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the
law of a mean-field model in state--observation space. The ensemble Kalman
filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of
interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution
of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are
robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed
by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator
taking probability distributions as input: a Measure Neural Mapping (MNM). A
MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble
filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-fieldlimit and for
interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses
empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set
transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for
different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field
formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at
different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of
parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the
scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior
root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the
Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.

Abstract: This paper investigates regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
algorithms for estimating nonlinear operators from a Polish space to a
separable Hilbert space. We assume that the regression operator lies in a
vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued
kernel. Two significant settings are considered: an online setting with
polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, and a
finite-horizon setting with constant step sizes and regularization parameters.
We introduce regularity conditions on the structure and smoothness of the
target operator and the input random variables. Under these conditions, we
provide a dimension-free convergence analysis for the prediction and estimation
errors, deriving both expectation and high-probability error bounds. Our
analysis demonstrates that these convergence rates are nearly optimal.
Furthermore, we present a new technique for deriving bounds with high
probability for general SGD schemes, which also ensures almost-sure
convergence. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to more general
operator-valued kernels and the encoder-decoder framework.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) for high-dimensional regression (HDR) is an important
problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited sample size
in the target task. However, there currently lacks a method to quantify the
statistical significance of the relationship between features and the response
in TL-HDR settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical inference
framework for assessing the reliability of feature selection in TL-HDR, called
PTL-SI (Post-TL Statistical Inference). The core contribution of PTL-SI is its
ability to provide valid $p$-values to features selected in TL-HDR, thereby
rigorously controlling the false positive rate (FPR) at desired significance
level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Furthermore, we enhance statistical power by
incorporating a strategic divide-and-conquer approach into our framework. We
demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed PTL-SI through
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
datasets, confirming its theoretical properties and utility in testing the
reliability of feature selection in TL scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of distributed multi-view representation learning. In
this problem, $K$ agents observe each one distinct, possibly statistically
correlated, view and independently extracts from it a suitable representation
in a manner that a decoder that gets all $K$ representations estimates
correctly the hidden label. In the absence of any explicit coordination between
the agents, a central question is: what should each agent extract from its view
that is necessary and sufficient for a correct estimation at the decoder? In
this paper, we investigate this question from a generalization error
perspective. First, we establish several generalization bounds in terms of the
relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from
training and "test" datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the
Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for all views and
training and test datasets. Then, we use the obtained bounds to devise a
regularizer; and investigate in depth the question of the selection of a
suitable prior. In particular, we show and conduct experiments that illustrate
that our data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors with judiciously chosen weights
lead to good performance. For single-view settings (i.e., $K=1$), our
experimental results are shown to outperform existing prior art Variational
Information Bottleneck (VIB) and Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB) approaches.
Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in
this setting. Finally, for the multi-view setting, we show that the selection
of the joint prior as a Gaussians product mixture induces a Gaussian mixture
marginal prior for each marginal view and implicitly encourages the agents to
extract and output redundant features, a finding which is somewhat
counter-intuitive.

Abstract: Functional survival models are key tools for analyzing time-to-event data
with complex predictors, such as functional or high-dimensional inputs. Despite
their predictive strength, these models often lack interpretability, which
limits their value in practical decision-making and risk analysis. This study
investigates two key survival models: the Functional Survival Tree (FST) and
the Functional Random Survival Forest (FRSF). It introduces novel methods and
tools to enhance the interpretability of FST models and improve the
explainability of FRSF ensembles. Using both real and simulated datasets, the
results demonstrate that the proposed approaches yield efficient,
easy-to-understand decision trees that accurately capture the underlying
decision-making processes of the model ensemble.

Abstract: We consider the problem of modelling the effects of unseen perturbations such
as gene knockdowns or drug combinations on low-level measurements such as RNA
sequencing data. Specifically, given data collected under some perturbations,
we aim to predict the distribution of measurements for new perturbations. To
address this challenging extrapolation task, we posit that perturbations act
additively in a suitable, unknown embedding space. More precisely, we formulate
the generative process underlying the observed data as a latent variable model,
in which perturbations amount to mean shifts in latent space and can be
combined additively. Unlike previous work, we prove that, given sufficiently
diverse training perturbations, the representation and perturbation effects are
identifiable up to affine transformation, and use this to characterize the
class of unseen perturbations for which we obtain extrapolation guarantees. To
estimate the model from data, we propose a new method, the perturbation
distribution autoencoder (PDAE), which is trained by maximising the
distributional similarity between true and predicted perturbation
distributions. The trained model can then be used to predict previously unseen
perturbation distributions. Empirical evidence suggests that PDAE compares
favourably to existing methods and baselines at predicting the effects of
unseen perturbations.

Abstract: Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) is a fundamental technique
for decomposing multi-dimensional data into a low-rank tensor and an outlier
tensor, yet existing methods relying on sparse outlier assumptions often fail
under structured corruptions. In this paper, we propose a self-guided data
augmentation approach that employs adaptive weighting to suppress outlier
influence, reformulating the original TRPCA problem into a standard Tensor
Principal Component Analysis (TPCA) problem. The proposed model involves an
optimization-driven weighting scheme that dynamically identifies and
downweights outlier contributions during tensor augmentation. We develop an
efficient proximal block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates
to solve the resulting optimization problem, ensuring computational efficiency.
Theoretical convergence is guaranteed through a framework combining block
coordinate descent with majorization-minimization principles. Numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including face recovery,
background subtraction, and hyperspectral denoising, demonstrate that our
method effectively handles various corruption patterns. The results show the
improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: PODNO在高频问题中表现优于FNO，并通过数值实验验证。

Conclusion: PODNO在高频PDE问题中具有潜力，且GSO的普适性得到理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators
(PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by
high-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural
Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse)
orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis,
the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational
efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we
established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as
Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's
performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear
Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.

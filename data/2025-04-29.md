### [1] [Mind the Language Gap: Automated and Augmented Evaluation of Bias in LLMs for High- and Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18560)
*Alessio Buscemi,Cédric Lothritz,Sergio Morales,Marcos Gomez-Vazquez,Robert Clarisó,Jordi Cabot,German Castignani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLA-BiTe框架通过多语言测试改进LLM偏见评估方法，支持六种语言（含两种低资源语言）的全面偏见测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但常延续训练数据中的社会偏见，需改进偏见评估方法。

Method: 引入MLA-BiTe框架，利用自动翻译和改写技术进行多语言偏见测试。

Result: 测试了四种先进LLMs在六种语言中的七类敏感歧视问题。

Conclusion: MLA-BiTe为多语言偏见评估提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive natural language
processing capabilities but often perpetuate social biases inherent in their
training data. To address this, we introduce MultiLingual Augmented Bias
Testing (MLA-BiTe), a framework that improves prior bias evaluation methods by
enabling systematic multilingual bias testing. MLA-BiTe leverages automated
translation and paraphrasing techniques to support comprehensive assessments
across diverse linguistic settings. In this study, we evaluate the
effectiveness of MLA-BiTe by testing four state-of-the-art LLMs in six
languages -- including two low-resource languages -- focusing on seven
sensitive categories of discrimination.

### [2] [Span-Level Hallucination Detection for LLM-Generated Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18639)
*Passant Elchafei,Mervet Abu-Elkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义角色标注（SRL）和文本蕴含模型的跨度级幻觉检测框架，用于检测LLM生成答案中的幻觉部分，并在Mu-SHROOM数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测LLM生成答案中的幻觉跨度对提高事实一致性至关重要。

Method: 结合语义角色标注（SRL）将答案分解为原子角色，通过基于问题的LLM提示获取参考上下文，并使用DeBERTa文本蕴含模型评估语义对齐。通过输出logits的token级置信度进一步优化蕴含分数，最终检测幻觉跨度。

Result: 在Mu-SHROOM数据集上表现出竞争力，并通过GPT-4和LLaMA验证了幻觉跨度的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了LLM生成答案中幻觉跨度的检测能力。

Abstract: Detecting spans of hallucination in LLM-generated answers is crucial for
improving factual consistency. This paper presents a span-level hallucination
detection framework for the SemEval-2025 Shared Task, focusing on English and
Arabic texts. Our approach integrates Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to decompose
the answer into atomic roles, which are then compared with a retrieved
reference context obtained via question-based LLM prompting. Using a
DeBERTa-based textual entailment model, we evaluate each role semantic
alignment with the retrieved context. The entailment scores are further refined
through token-level confidence measures derived from output logits, and the
combined scores are used to detect hallucinated spans. Experiments on the
Mu-SHROOM dataset demonstrate competitive performance. Additionally,
hallucinated spans have been verified through fact-checking by prompting GPT-4
and LLaMA. Our findings contribute to improving hallucination detection in
LLM-generated responses.

### [3] [Can Third-parties Read Our Emotions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18673)
*Jiayi Li,Yingfan Zhou,Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Halima Binte Islam,Sneha Arya,Shomir Wilson,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了第三方标注（包括人类标注者和大型语言模型）在捕捉作者私人状态（如情感）时的局限性，发现LLMs表现优于人类标注者，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证第三方标注是否能准确反映作者的私人状态（如情感），并探讨其局限性。

Method: 通过实验比较第三方标注（人类和LLMs）与第一方（作者提供）标注的差异，并探索改进方法。

Result: 发现第三方标注存在显著局限性，LLMs表现优于人类标注者；标注者与作者的人口统计相似性可提升标注质量。

Conclusion: 呼吁改进标注实践以更准确地反映作者私人状态，并提出评估框架。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing tasks that aim to infer an author's private
states, e.g., emotions and opinions, from their written text, typically rely on
datasets annotated by third-party annotators. However, the assumption that
third-party annotators can accurately capture authors' private states remains
largely unexamined. In this study, we present human subjects experiments on
emotion recognition tasks that directly compare third-party annotations with
first-party (author-provided) emotion labels. Our findings reveal significant
limitations in third-party annotations-whether provided by human annotators or
large language models (LLMs)-in faithfully representing authors' private
states. However, LLMs outperform human annotators nearly across the board. We
further explore methods to improve third-party annotation quality. We find that
demographic similarity between first-party authors and third-party human
annotators enhances annotation performance. While incorporating first-party
demographic information into prompts leads to a marginal but statistically
significant improvement in LLMs' performance. We introduce a framework for
evaluating the limitations of third-party annotations and call for refined
annotation practices to accurately represent and model authors' private states.

### [4] [Spatial Speech Translation: Translating Across Space With Binaural Hearables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18715)
*Tuochao Chen,Qirui Wang,Runlin He,Shyam Gollakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的听觉设备技术，能够在嘈杂环境中实时翻译多语言对话，同时保留说话者的空间位置和声音特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有翻译设备在多语言嘈杂环境中无法保留说话者空间位置和声音特征的问题。

Method: 结合盲源分离、定位、实时表达翻译和双耳渲染技术，实现实时翻译并保留空间线索。

Result: 在Apple M2芯片上实现实时推理，BLEU得分达22.01，用户研究证实系统在真实环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 首次将空间感知融入语音翻译，为未来听觉设备技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Imagine being in a crowded space where people speak a different language and
having hearables that transform the auditory space into your native language,
while preserving the spatial cues for all speakers. We introduce spatial speech
translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the
wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice
characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we
tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation,
localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to
preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving
real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation
with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which
fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01
when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other
speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's
effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen
real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the
first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.

### [5] [Building UD Cairo for Old English in the Classroom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18718)
*Lauren Levine,Junghyun Min,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了基于UD Cairo句子的古英语样本树库，通过结合LLM提示和真实古英语数据搜索收集数据，并由初学者标注后比较修正。结果表明LLM输出需后编辑，初学者标注虽不完美但集体效果良好。初步解析实验显示现代英语训练数据对古英语解析效果不佳，但标注特征可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为历史语言学课程创建古英语样本树库，探索LLM和初学者标注在古英语数据处理中的效果。

Method: 结合LLM提示和真实古英语数据搜索收集20个句子，由初学者标注后比较修正，并进行初步解析实验。

Result: LLM输出需后编辑以反映真实语法；初学者集体标注效果良好；现代英语训练数据对古英语解析效果差，但标注特征可改善性能。

Conclusion: LLM和初学者标注可用于古英语数据处理，但需后编辑和集体协作；标注特征对解析性能有积极影响。

Abstract: In this paper we present a sample treebank for Old English based on the UD
Cairo sentences, collected and annotated as part of a classroom curriculum in
Historical Linguistics. To collect the data, a sample of 20 sentences
illustrating a range of syntactic constructions in the world's languages, we
employ a combination of LLM prompting and searches in authentic Old English
data. For annotation we assigned sentences to multiple students with limited
prior exposure to UD, whose annotations we compare and adjudicate. Our results
suggest that while current LLM outputs in Old English do not reflect authentic
syntax, this can be mitigated by post-editing, and that although beginner
annotators do not possess enough background to complete the task perfectly,
taken together they can produce good results and learn from the experience. We
also conduct preliminary parsing experiments using Modern English training
data, and find that although performance on Old English is poor, parsing on
annotated features (lemma, hyperlemma, gloss) leads to improved performance.

### [6] [EvidenceBench: A Benchmark for Extracting Evidence from Biomedical Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18736)
*Jianyou Wang,Weili Cao,Kaicheng Wang,Xiaoyue Wang,Ashish Dalvi,Gino Prasad,Qishan Liang,Hsuan-lin Her,Ming Wang,Qin Yang,Gene W. Yeo,David E. Neal,Maxim Khan,Christopher D. Rosin,Ramamohan Paturi,Leon Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了自动从生物医学论文中查找与假设相关证据的任务，提出了EvidenceBench基准，并通过专家标注验证了其有效性，发现现有模型性能仍远低于专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究科学假设时，查找相关证据是关键步骤，但目前缺乏有效的自动化方法。

Method: 提出了一种由假设生成和逐句标注组成的新流程，创建了EvidenceBench基准，并通过专家标注验证其准确性。

Result: 评估了多种语言模型和检索系统，发现其性能显著低于专家水平；扩展了EvidenceBench-100k数据集，包含10万+标注论文。

Conclusion: EvidenceBench为模型训练和开发提供了可靠基准，但现有技术仍需改进以接近专家水平。

Abstract: We study the task of automatically finding evidence relevant to hypotheses in
biomedical papers. Finding relevant evidence is an important step when
researchers investigate scientific hypotheses. We introduce EvidenceBench to
measure models performance on this task, which is created by a novel pipeline
that consists of hypothesis generation and sentence-by-sentence annotation of
biomedical papers for relevant evidence, completely guided by and faithfully
following existing human experts judgment. We demonstrate the pipeline's
validity and accuracy with multiple sets of human-expert annotations. We
evaluated a diverse set of language models and retrieval systems on the
benchmark and found that model performances still fall significantly short of
the expert level on this task. To show the scalability of our proposed
pipeline, we create a larger EvidenceBench-100k with 107,461 fully annotated
papers with hypotheses to facilitate model training and development. Both
datasets are available at https://github.com/EvidenceBench/EvidenceBench

### [7] [SynLexLM: Scaling Legal LLMs with Synthetic Data and Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18762)
*Ojasw Upadhyay,Abishek Saravankumar,Ayman Ismail*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynLexLM是一种新颖的方法，通过课程学习和合成数据增强，高效预训练法律领域的LLM，旨在提升法律基准测试的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练可能无法捕捉法律领域的细微差别，且获取足够法律数据具有挑战性。SynLexLM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用课程学习（从简单到复杂的法律文本和查询）和合成数据增强（如使用Gemini Pro生成QA对）。

Result: 初步工作包括生成反映法律推理的合成QA对，目标是在法律基准测试（BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum）上优于传统模型和微调版本。

Conclusion: SynLexLM有望提升法律文件分析和研究工具，推动法律AI的普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often require extensive
fine-tuning and large datasets for specialized domains like law.
General-purpose pre-training may not capture legal nuances, and acquiring
sufficient legal data is challenging. We introduce SynLexLM, a novel approach
to efficiently pre-train a legal LLM. Our method employs curriculum learning,
progressing from simple to complex legal texts and queries, combined with
synthetic data augmentation using models like Gemini Pro to address data
scarcity. We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks
(BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned
versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting
legal reasoning. This work aims to enhance legal document analysis and research
tools, potentially democratizing access to advanced legal AI.

### [8] [Stealing Creator's Workflow: A Creator-Inspired Agentic Framework with Iterative Feedback Loop for Improved Scientific Short-form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18805)
*Jong Inn Park,Maanas Taneja,Qianwen Wang,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciTalk是一个多LLM代理框架，用于从科学论文生成准确且吸引人的短视频，通过迭代反馈机制优化内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端方法在科学传播中因内容复杂性和专家与读者差距导致的事实不准确和视觉伪影问题。

Method: 采用多代理框架，包括内容摘要、视觉场景规划、文本和布局编辑，并通过模拟用户角色的代理进行迭代反馈。

Result: 实验表明，SciTalk在生成科学准确且吸引人的内容上优于简单提示方法，但尚未达到人类创作者的质量。

Conclusion: SciTalk为反馈驱动的视频生成提供了有价值的见解，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Generating engaging, accurate short-form videos from scientific papers is
challenging due to content complexity and the gap between expert authors and
readers. Existing end-to-end methods often suffer from factual inaccuracies and
visual artifacts, limiting their utility for scientific dissemination. To
address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework,
grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and
avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized
agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout
editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents
simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous
iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that
SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically
accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation.
Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators'
quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and
benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated
videos will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）评估中的核心挑战，包括从任务特定到能力评估的转变，以及从人工到自动评估的过渡，并指出了评估泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，传统的评估方法已无法满足需求，需要新的评估框架来应对其能力的扩展。

Method: 论文分析了两种关键转变：能力评估和自动评估，并从方法、数据集、评估者和指标的角度探讨了核心挑战。

Result: 提出了评估泛化问题，并强调了动态数据集和“LLM作为评判者”的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁社区共同维护一个GitHub仓库，以持续更新和修正评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at an amazing speed and have
become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications. To keep
pace with the status quo, this survey probes the core challenges that the rise
of LLMs poses for evaluation. We identify and analyze two pivotal transitions:
(i) from task-specific to capability-based evaluation, which reorganizes
benchmarks around core competencies such as knowledge, reasoning, instruction
following, multi-modal understanding, and safety; and (ii) from manual to
automated evaluation, encompassing dynamic dataset curation and
"LLM-as-a-judge" scoring.
  Yet, even with these transitions, a crucial obstacle persists: the evaluation
generalization issue. Bounded test sets cannot scale alongside models whose
abilities grow seemingly without limit. We will dissect this issue, along with
the core challenges of the above two transitions, from the perspectives of
methods, datasets, evaluators, and metrics. Due to the fast evolving of this
field, we will maintain a living GitHub repository (links are in each section)
to crowd-source updates and corrections, and warmly invite contributors and
collaborators.

### [10] [Towards Robust Dialogue Breakdown Detection: Addressing Disruptors in Large Language Models with Self-Guided Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839)
*Abdellah Ghassel,Xianzhi Li,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合微调和高级提示策略的方法，用于检测和缓解LLM驱动的对话系统中的对话崩溃问题，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在许多对话任务中表现出色，但仍可能产生不连贯或矛盾的响应（即对话崩溃），影响用户信任。因此，需要一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 通过结合专门微调和高级提示策略（如少样本学习、思维链推理和类比提示），并微调一个8B模型，同时设计实时部署架构。

Result: 在英语和日语对话中展示了模型的鲁棒分类和校准能力，在BETOLD数据集上实现了7%的准确率提升，同时显著降低了运营成本和能耗。

Conclusion: 该方法为高影响领域的稳健对话AI提供了可扩展的解决方案，结合了效率、可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly changing various domains. However,
their capabilities in handling conversational breakdowns still require an
in-depth exploration. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and
mitigating dialogue breakdowns within LLM-driven conversational systems. While
powerful models from OpenAI and Anthropic excel in many dialogue tasks, they
can still produce incoherent or contradictory responses, commonly referred to
as breakdowns, which undermine user trust. To tackle this, we propose an
approach that combines specialized fine-tuning with advanced prompting
strategies, including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and
analogical prompting. In particular, we fine-tune a small 8B model and
demonstrate its robust classification and calibration capabilities in English
and Japanese dialogue. We also validate its generalization on the BETOLD
dataset, achieving a 7\% accuracy improvement over its base model. Furthermore,
we introduce a real-time deployment architecture that selectively escalates
suspicious responses to more resource-intensive frontier models only when
breakdowns are detected, significantly cutting operational expenses and energy
consumption. Experimental results show our method surpasses prior
state-of-the-art specialized classifiers while also narrowing performance gaps
between smaller open-source models and large proprietary ones. Our approach
offers a scalable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains
by combining efficiency, interpretability, and reliability.

### [11] [When2Call: When (not) to Call Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18851)
*Hayley Ross,Ameya Sunil Mahabaleshwarkar,Yoshi Suhara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的基准测试When2Call，用于评估语言模型在工具调用决策上的表现，包括何时调用工具、何时提问或承认无法回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注工具调用的准确性，而忽略了评估语言模型何时应（不）调用工具的重要性。

Method: 开发了When2Call基准测试，并利用其多选特性设计了一种偏好优化训练方法。

Result: 当前最先进的工具调用语言模型在When2Call上表现不佳，表明其重要性；偏好优化训练方法比传统微调效果更好。

Conclusion: When2Call基准测试和训练数据为语言模型的工具调用决策提供了重要评估和改进方向。

Abstract: Leveraging external tools is a key feature for modern Language Models (LMs)
to expand their capabilities and integrate them into existing systems. However,
existing benchmarks primarily focus on the accuracy of tool calling -- whether
the correct tool is called with the correct parameters -- and less on
evaluating when LMs should (not) call tools. We develop a new benchmark,
When2Call, which evaluates tool-calling decision-making: when to generate a
tool call, when to ask follow-up questions and when to admit the question can't
be answered with the tools provided. We find that state-of-the-art tool-calling
LMs show significant room for improvement on When2Call, indicating the
importance of this benchmark. We also develop a training set for When2Call and
leverage the multiple-choice nature of the benchmark to develop a preference
optimization training regime, which shows considerably more improvement than
traditional fine-tuning. We release the benchmark and training data as well as
evaluation scripts at https://github.com/NVIDIA/When2Call.

### [12] [Effective Length Extrapolation via Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18857)
*Yi Lu,Wanxu Zhao,Xin Zhou,Chenxin An,Chenglong Wang,Shuo Li,Yuming Yang,Jun Zhao,Tao Ji,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架DPE，通过分析RoPE的不同隐藏维度来扩展LLMs的上下文窗口，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理超出预训练长度的输入时表现不佳，现有扩展上下文窗口的方法训练成本高。

Method: 通过检测每个维度的有效长度并调整关键维度的位置索引，最小化修改预训练模型。

Result: DPE显著超越基线方法，支持128k tokens的上下文窗口，并在训练长度内提升模型性能。

Conclusion: DPE是一种高效且无需训练的上下文扩展方法，性能优于商业模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to process and generate coherent
context when the number of input tokens exceeds the pre-trained length. Recent
advancements in long-context extension have significantly expanded the context
window of LLMs but require expensive overhead to train the large-scale models
with longer context. In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional
Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the
context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions.
Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective
length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension.
We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the
pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their
most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with
minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal
state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such
as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of
128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash
Attention 2. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DPE also
dramatically improves the models' performance within training length, such as
Llama3.1 70B, by over 18 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER. When
compared with commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with DPE even achieves better
performance than GPT-4-128K.

### [13] [Latent Adversarial Training Improves the Representation of Refusal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18872)
*Alexandra Abbas,Nora Petrova,Helios Ael Lyons,Natalia Perez-Campanero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型的拒绝行为主要编码在其潜在空间的单一方向上，容易受到针对性攻击。尽管潜在对抗训练（LAT）通过引入噪声试图提高鲁棒性，但其对拒绝行为表示的影响尚不明确。通过分析Llama 2 7B，发现LAT显著改变了拒绝行为的表示，使其集中在SVD的前两个成分中，提高了鲁棒性但也增加了对自生成攻击向量的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索潜在对抗训练（LAT）如何影响语言模型中拒绝行为的潜在空间表示，以评估其有效性和局限性。

Method: 通过分析Llama 2 7B模型，计算有害与无害指令对的激活差异，并应用奇异值分解（SVD）来研究LAT对拒绝行为表示的影响。

Result: LAT显著改变了拒绝行为的表示，将其集中在SVD的前两个成分中（占差异方差的75%），提高了鲁棒性但也增加了对自生成攻击向量的脆弱性。

Conclusion: LAT通过训练扰动实现了更全面的拒绝行为表示，展示了其在提升模型安全性方面的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models' refusal behavior is primarily
encoded in a single direction in their latent space, making it vulnerable to
targeted attacks. Although Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) attempts to
improve robustness by introducing noise during training, a key question
remains: How does this noise-based training affect the underlying
representation of refusal behavior? Understanding this encoding is crucial for
evaluating LAT's effectiveness and limitations, just as the discovery of linear
refusal directions revealed vulnerabilities in traditional supervised safety
fine-tuning (SSFT).
  Through the analysis of Llama 2 7B, we examine how LAT reorganizes the
refusal behavior in the model's latent space compared to SSFT and embedding
space adversarial training (AT). By computing activation differences between
harmful and harmless instruction pairs and applying Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), we find that LAT significantly alters the refusal
representation, concentrating it in the first two SVD components which explain
approximately 75 percent of the activation differences variance - significantly
higher than in reference models. This concentrated representation leads to more
effective and transferable refusal vectors for ablation attacks: LAT models
show improved robustness when attacked with vectors from reference models but
become more vulnerable to self-generated vectors compared to SSFT and AT. Our
findings suggest that LAT's training perturbations enable a more comprehensive
representation of refusal behavior, highlighting both its potential strengths
and vulnerabilities for improving model safety.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过集成多个中型LLM的推理结果来提高情感分析任务的鲁棒性和准确性的方法，相比单次大型模型，RMSE降低了18.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献忽视了LLM结果的可变性和可重复性问题，而实际人类标注通常通过多数投票解决分歧。

Method: 采用简单的集成策略，结合多个中型LLM的推理结果。

Result: 集成方法比单次大型模型更鲁棒且准确，RMSE降低了18.6%。

Conclusion: 集成中型LLM是一种有效提升情感分析性能的策略。

Abstract: With the advance of large language models (LLMs), LLMs have been utilized for
the various tasks. However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of
results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing
literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve
disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the
straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the
results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using
medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large
model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.

### [15] [MTCSC: Retrieval-Augmented Iterative Refinement for Chinese Spelling Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18938)
*Junhong Liang,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多轮中文拼写纠正框架（MTCSC），通过检索增强生成（RAG）和长度反射机制，解决了传统方法在变长纠正和领域适应上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中文拼写纠正（CSC）方法要求输入输出长度一致，且难以适应领域特定纠正需求，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出MTCSC框架，结合RAG和长度反射机制，构建领域特定检索数据库，并通过多源组合策略和迭代长度反射确保输出长度一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样领域数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在处理领域特定和变长错误纠正任务时表现突出。

Conclusion: MTCSC框架有效扩展了传统CSC的能力，为变长和领域特定纠正任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous tokens
in sentences. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success
in identifying and rectifying potential errors, they often struggle with
maintaining consistent output lengths and adapting to domain-specific
corrections. Furthermore, existing CSC task impose rigid constraints requiring
input and output lengths to be identical, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we extend traditional CSC to variable-length correction scenarios,
including Chinese Splitting Error Correction (CSEC) and ASR N-best Error
Correction. To address domain adaptation and length consistency, we propose
MTCSC (Multi-Turn CSC) framework based on RAG enhanced with a length reflection
mechanism. Our approach constructs a retrieval database from domain-specific
training data and dictionaries, fine-tuning retrievers to optimize performance
for error-containing inputs. Additionally, we introduce a multi-source
combination strategy with iterative length reflection to ensure output length
fidelity. Experiments across diverse domain datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms current approaches in correction quality,
particularly in handling domain-specific and variable-length error correction
tasks.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LawFlow数据集，用于捕捉法律工作流的动态和模块化推理过程，比较了人类与LLM生成的工作流差异，并提出了AI辅助法律实践的设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在法律领域的应用局限于孤立子任务，无法支持端到端的法律决策。LawFlow旨在填补这一空白，捕捉真实法律实践中的动态推理过程。

Method: 通过LawFlow数据集，收集法律学生完成的端到端法律工作流，并与LLM生成的工作流进行比较分析。

Result: 人类工作流更具模块化和适应性，而LLM工作流更线性且缺乏对下游影响的敏感性。法律专业人士更倾向于AI在支持性角色中发挥作用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在复杂法律工作流中的局限性，并提出了结合人类目标的AI设计建议，以提升协作性和推理能力。

Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex,
high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI
holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are
narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end
decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we
introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected
from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation
scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains
of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning
processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies
of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows,
revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan
execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows
are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications.
Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out
supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing
alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Building on
these findings, we propose a set of design suggestions, rooted in empirical
observations, that align AI assistance with human goals of clarity,
completeness, creativity, and efficiency, through hybrid planning, adaptive
execution, and decision-point support. Our results highlight both the current
limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for
developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems. All data and
code are available on our project page

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DF-Merge的动态Fisher加权合并方法，通过统一模型级和参数级合并策略，结合贝叶斯优化动态调整系数，显著提升了多任务模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型合并方法在模型级或参数级合并时存在性能差距，无法达到多任务微调的效果。

Method: 提出DF-Merge框架，通过贝叶斯优化动态调整模型参数系数，并结合Fisher信息进行参数重要性加权。

Result: 实验表明，DF-Merge在不同规模和任务上均优于基线方法，且只需少量验证数据和迭代即可接近最优性能。

Conclusion: DF-Merge通过统一合并策略和动态优化，显著提升了多任务模型的性能，且高效实用。

Abstract: The fine-tuning of pre-trained language models has resulted in the widespread
availability of task-specific models. Model merging offers an efficient way to
create multi-task models by combining these fine-tuned models at the parameter
level, without the need for training data or joint training on multiple
datasets. Existing merging approaches typically involve scaling the parameters
model-wise or integrating parameter importance parameter-wise. Both approaches
exhibit their own weaknesses, leading to a notable performance gap compared to
multi-task fine-tuning. In this paper, we unify these seemingly distinct
strategies into a more general merging framework, and introduce Dynamic
Fisher-weighted Merging (DF-Merge). Specifically, candidate models are
associated with a set of coefficients that linearly scale their fine-tuned
parameters. Bayesian optimization is applied to dynamically adjust these
coefficients, aiming to maximize overall performance on validation sets. Each
iteration of this process integrates parameter importance based on the Fisher
information conditioned by the coefficients. Experimental results show that
DF-Merge outperforms strong baselines across models of different sizes and a
variety of tasks. Our analysis shows that the effectiveness of DF-Merge arises
from the unified view of merging and that near-optimal performance is
achievable in a few iterations, even with minimal validation data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GoAT是一种基于图结构的对抗性提示生成方法，用于测试大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性，其成功率比现有方法高五倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是对抗性攻击绕过安全机制的问题。识别这些漏洞对提升LLMs的鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: GoAT利用图思维框架生成对抗性提示，通过动态图结构整合和优化攻击路径，无需访问目标模型参数，实现黑盒攻击。

Result: GoAT在对抗性攻击中表现优异，对Llama等鲁棒模型的攻击成功率比现有方法高五倍，且生成的提示质量高、可读性强。

Conclusion: GoAT通过图结构优化攻击路径，显著提升了对抗性攻击的效率和效果，为LLMs的安全性测试提供了新方法。

Abstract: The challenge of ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) align with societal
standards is of increasing interest, as these models are still prone to
adversarial jailbreaks that bypass their safety mechanisms. Identifying these
vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such
exploits. We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating
adversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of
Thoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024]. GoAT excels at generating highly
effective jailbreak prompts with fewer queries to the victim model than
state-of-the-art attacks, achieving up to five times better jailbreak success
rate against robust models like Llama. Notably, GoAT creates high-quality,
human-readable prompts without requiring access to the targeted model's
parameters, making it a black-box attack. Unlike approaches constrained by
tree-based reasoning, GoAT's reasoning is based on a more intricate graph
structure. By making simultaneous attack paths aware of each other's progress,
this dynamic framework allows a deeper integration and refinement of reasoning
paths, significantly enhancing the collaborative exploration of adversarial
vulnerabilities in LLMs. At a technical level, GoAT starts with a graph
structure and iteratively refines it by combining and improving thoughts,
enabling synergy between different thought paths. The code for our
implementation can be found at: https://github.com/GoAT-pydev/Graph_of_Attacks.

Result: 领域特定模型（如SciBERT、BioBERT）表现优于通用模型（如BERT），动态学习率和早停技术显著提升了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 数据增强、推理驱动的标签预测、硬投票和微调技术为自动化学术文本分类提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient text classification is essential for handling the increasing volume
of academic publications. This study explores the use of pre-trained language
models (PLMs), including BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT, fine-tuned on
the Web of Science (WoS-46985) dataset for scientific text classification. To
enhance performance, we augment the dataset by executing seven targeted queries
in the WoS database, retrieving 1,000 articles per category aligned with
WoS-46985's main classes. PLMs predict labels for this unlabeled data, and a
hard-voting strategy combines predictions for improved accuracy and confidence.
Fine-tuning on the expanded dataset with dynamic learning rates and early
stopping significantly boosts classification accuracy, especially in
specialized domains. Domain-specific models like SciBERT and BioBERT
consistently outperform general-purpose models such as BERT. These findings
underscore the efficacy of dataset augmentation, inference-driven label
prediction, hard-voting, and fine-tuning techniques in creating robust and
scalable solutions for automated academic text classification.

Motivation: 解决在基于强化学习的知识蒸馏中，梯度估计方差大的问题，尤其是在学生模型较大时。

Method: 提出KETCHUP方法，利用贝尔曼最优方程进行多步回报估计，以减少梯度方差。

Result: 在三个文本生成任务中，KETCHUP在标准任务指标和基于大语言模型（LLM）的评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: K-step回报估计为基于强化学习的知识蒸馏提供了有前景的改进方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel k-step return estimation method (called KETCHUP) for
Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based knowledge distillation (KD) in text generation
tasks. Our idea is to induce a K-step return by using the Bellman Optimality
Equation for multiple steps. Theoretical analysis shows that this K-step
formulation reduces the variance of the gradient estimates, thus leading to
improved RL optimization especially when the student model size is large.
Empirical evaluation on three text generation tasks demonstrates that our
approach yields superior performance in both standard task metrics and large
language model (LLM)-based evaluation. These results suggest that our K-step
return induction offers a promising direction for enhancing RL-based KD in LLM
research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过优化Pearson相关性来校准假设似然的方法，显著提升了神经机器翻译的质量，并在多种指标和人类评估中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大后验概率（MAP）解码在神经机器翻译中效果不佳，与真实翻译质量不匹配，需要改进。

Method: 通过直接优化Pearson相关性来校准假设似然，提升翻译解码效果。

Result: 在大型语言模型（LLM）上，仅需少量训练即可显著提升翻译质量，且校准后的似然可直接作为翻译质量的强代理指标。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MAP解码的效果，并在多语言翻译任务中达到最先进水平，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a
posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the
distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP
decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the
decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This
paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from
a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby
enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method,
translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after
limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal
to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains
across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to
top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality
translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference
optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood
can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely
approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality
estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates
that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling
greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art
translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code
and human evaluation data, has been released to the community:

Method: 研究通过全面的数值模拟，评估开源LLMs在提取出院报告关键事件（如入院原因、住院期间重要事件和关键随访行动）时的性能，并分析摘要中幻觉的普遍性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在临床摘要中表现良好，但存在一定程度的幻觉现象，这可能影响信息的可靠性。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs在临床摘要中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以减少幻觉，确保信息的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Clinical summarization is crucial in healthcare as it distills complex
medical data into digestible information, enhancing patient understanding and
care management. Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential
in automating and improving the accuracy of such summarizations due to their
advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models are
particularly applicable in the context of summarizing medical/clinical texts,
where precise and concise information transfer is essential. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from
discharge reports, such as reasons for hospital admission, significant
in-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess
the prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by
these models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the
reliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and
treatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to
rigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the
accuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization.

Motivation: 全球许多地区缺乏局部和细粒度的极端天气数据，限制了分析和决策能力。LLMs能够处理大量非结构化文本数据并提取有用信息，但如何将这些能力有效传递给小型模型是关键问题。

Method: 提出EWRA方法，通过LLMs生成的结构化推理路径增强SLMs，并构建ExtremeWeatherNews数据集。框架ClimaEmpact专注于极端天气任务的分类、主题标注和情感分析。

Result: EWRA方法显著提升了SLMs在极端天气分析中的表现，生成领域对齐的响应，优于任务专用模型。

Conclusion: EWRA和ExtremeWeatherNews为极端天气分析提供了高效工具，增强了小型模型的实用性和领域适应性。

Abstract: Accurate assessments of extreme weather events are vital for research and
policy, yet localized and granular data remain scarce in many parts of the
world. This data gap limits our ability to analyze potential outcomes and
implications of extreme weather events, hindering effective decision-making.
Large Language Models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of unstructured text
data, extract meaningful insights, and generate detailed assessments by
synthesizing information from multiple sources. Furthermore, LLMs can
seamlessly transfer their general language understanding to smaller models,
enabling these models to retain key knowledge while being fine-tuned for
specific tasks. In this paper, we propose Extreme Weather Reasoning-Aware
Alignment (EWRA), a method that enhances small language models (SLMs) by
incorporating structured reasoning paths derived from LLMs, and
ExtremeWeatherNews, a large dataset of extreme weather event-related news
articles. EWRA and ExtremeWeatherNews together form the overall framework,
ClimaEmpact, that focuses on addressing three critical extreme-weather tasks:
categorization of tangible vulnerabilities/impacts, topic labeling, and emotion
analysis. By aligning SLMs with advanced reasoning strategies on
ExtremeWeatherNews (and its derived dataset ExtremeAlign used specifically for
SLM alignment), EWRA improves the SLMs' ability to generate well-grounded and
domain-specific responses for extreme weather analytics. Our results show that
the approach proposed guides SLMs to output domain-aligned responses,
surpassing the performance of task-specific models and offering enhanced
real-world applicability for extreme weather analytics.

Abstract: This paper presents our process for developing a sample-efficient language
model for a conversational Hinglish chatbot. Hinglish, a code-mixed language

demonstrate that models with fewer parameters, when appropriately fine-tuned on
high-quality code-mixed data, can achieve competitive performance for Hinglish
conversation generation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 解决大型推理语言模型因模型规模和长思维链导致的高成本和延迟问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SCoT将推理延迟降低48%~66%，同时性能接近目标模型水平。

Conclusion: SCoT是一种高效且准确的推理加速方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1 and Deepseek-R1 have
recently attracted widespread attention due to their impressive task-solving
abilities. However, the enormous model size and the generation of lengthy
thought chains introduce significant reasoning costs and response latency.
Existing methods for efficient reasoning mainly focus on reducing the number of
model parameters or shortening the chain-of-thought length. In this paper, we
introduce Speculative Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which reduces reasoning latency
from another perspective by accelerated average reasoning speed through large
and small model collaboration. SCoT conducts thought-level drafting using a
lightweight draft model. Then it selects the best CoT draft and corrects the
error cases with the target model. The proposed thinking behavior alignment
improves the efficiency of drafting and the draft selection strategy maintains
the prediction accuracy for complex problems. Experimental results on GSM8K,
MATH, GaoKao, CollegeMath and Olympiad datasets show that SCoT reduces
reasoning latency by 48\%$\sim$66\% for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B while
achieving near-target-model-level performance. Our code is available at

Result: 实验验证了FedE4RAG在提升私有RAG系统性能的同时，确保了数据隐私保护。

Conclusion: FedE4RAG为私有RAG系统提供了一种高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising
solution for enhancing the accuracy and credibility of Large Language Models
(LLMs), particularly in Question & Answer tasks. This is achieved by
incorporating proprietary and private data from integrated databases. However,
private RAG systems face significant challenges due to the scarcity of private
domain data and critical data privacy issues. These obstacles impede the
deployment of private RAG systems, as developing privacy-preserving RAG systems
requires a delicate balance between data security and data availability. To
address these challenges, we regard federated learning (FL) as a highly
promising technology for privacy-preserving RAG services. We propose a novel
framework called Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (FedE4RAG). This
framework facilitates collaborative training of client-side RAG retrieval
models. The parameters of these models are aggregated and distributed on a
central-server, ensuring data privacy without direct sharing of raw data. In
FedE4RAG, knowledge distillation is employed for communication between the
server and client models. This technique improves the generalization of local
RAG retrievers during the federated learning process. Additionally, we apply
homomorphic encryption within federated learning to safeguard model parameters
and mitigate concerns related to data leakage. Extensive experiments conducted
on the real-world dataset have validated the effectiveness of FedE4RAG. The
results demonstrate that our proposed framework can markedly enhance the
performance of private RAG systems while maintaining robust data privacy
protection.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in formal
theorem proving, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to isolated, static
proof tasks, failing to capture the iterative, engineering-intensive workflows
of real-world formal mathematics libraries. Motivated by analogous advances in
software engineering, we introduce the paradigm of Automated Proof Engineering
(APE), which aims to automate proof engineering tasks such as feature addition,
proof refactoring, and bug fixing using LLMs. To facilitate research in this
direction, we present APE-Bench I, the first realistic benchmark built from
real-world commit histories of Mathlib4, featuring diverse file-level tasks
described in natural language and verified via a hybrid approach combining the
Lean compiler and LLM-as-a-Judge. We further develop Eleanstic, a scalable
parallel verification infrastructure optimized for proof checking across
multiple versions of Mathlib. Empirical results on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate strong performance on localized edits but substantial degradation
on handling complex proof engineering. This work lays the foundation for
developing agentic workflows in proof engineering, with future benchmarks
targeting multi-file coordination, project-scale verification, and autonomous
agents capable of planning, editing, and repairing formal libraries.

Conclusion: SPC能有效提升LLM推理性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM)
reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty
and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we
introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves
its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games,
eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning
two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that
deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a
"critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models
engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic,
while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using
reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively
improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the
loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution.
Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K,
DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection
capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and
surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying
SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their
mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming
state-of-the-art process reward models.

Motivation: 增强大语言模型的表达能力和上下文连贯性，而非仅减少KV缓存大小。

Method: 引入混合头概念，结合标准多头注意力与RWKV-7状态驱动头，采用交叉头交互技术和多令牌状态处理机制。

Result: 显著提升模型在复杂推理和序列生成任务中的表现，同时参数增加极少。

Conclusion: WuNeng在表达能力和计算效率之间实现了新的平衡，为现代神经架构树立了新标准。

Abstract: The WuNeng architecture introduces a novel approach to enhancing the
expressivity and power of large language models by integrating recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based RWKV-7 with advanced attention mechanisms, prioritizing
heightened contextual coherence over reducing KV cache size. Building upon the
hybrid-head concept from Hymba, WuNeng augments standard multi-head attention
with additional RWKV-7 state-driven heads, rather than replacing existing
heads, to enrich the model's representational capacity. A cross-head
interaction technique fosters dynamic synergy among standard, state-driven, and
newly introduced middle heads, leveraging concatenation, additive modulation,
and gated fusion for robust information integration. Furthermore, a multi-token
state processing mechanism harnesses the continuous RWKV-7 state to capture
intricate, sequence-wide dependencies, significantly boosting expressivity.
Remarkably, these enhancements are achieved with minimal additional parameters,
ensuring efficiency while empowering the model to excel in complex reasoning
and sequence generation tasks. WuNeng sets a new standard for balancing
expressivity and computational efficiency in modern neural architectures.

Motivation: 目标是确定动态嵌入式主题模型的关键实现选择，以优化其在实际学术研究中的应用。

Method: 通过分析五个不同的历时语料库，评估了词汇量扩展和时间间隔建模等实现选择的效果。

Result: 发现词汇量扩展和时间间隔建模对模型实用性至关重要，而其他因素对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议在模型开发和应用中优先考虑词汇量扩展和时间间隔建模，以提高实用性。

Abstract: We measure the effects of several implementation choices for the Dynamic
Embedded Topic Model, as applied to five distinct diachronic corpora, with the
goal of isolating important decisions for its use and further development. We
identify priorities that will maximize utility in applied scholarship,
including the practical scalability of vocabulary size to best exploit the
strengths of embedded representations, and more flexible modeling of intervals
to accommodate the uneven temporal distributions of historical writing. Of
similar importance, we find performance is not significantly or consistently
affected by several aspects that otherwise limit the model's application or
might consume the resources of a grid search.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零资源幻觉检测框架，通过调整多种不确定性量化技术生成标准化置信度分数，并引入可调集成方法优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的广泛应用，幻觉问题日益突出，亟需有效的检测方法。

Method: 结合黑盒、白盒不确定性量化技术及LLM-as-a-Judge方法，生成0到1的标准化置信度分数，并开发可调集成框架。

Result: 实验表明，可调集成方法优于单一组件及现有幻觉检测方法。

Conclusion: 定制化幻觉检测策略能显著提升大语言模型的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As
these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as
healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is
crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource
hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases.
To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ)
techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge,
transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence
scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable
ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual
confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble
for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation,
the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit,
UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an
extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks.
We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components
and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results
demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for
improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Motivation: 视觉叙事任务需要结合计算机视觉和自然语言处理，但传统评估指标（如BLEU、METEOR等）无法有效衡量叙事质量，因此需要新的方法和指标。

Method: 采用多模态模型（如Transformer架构）和大型多模态模型，基于VIST数据集开发VIST-GPT模型，生成视觉基础且上下文连贯的叙事。

Result: VIST-GPT模型能够生成高质量的视觉叙事，并通过RoViST和GROOVIST指标验证其性能优于传统指标。

Conclusion: 新方法和评估指标为视觉叙事任务提供了更有效的解决方案，更贴近人类对叙事质量的判断。

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision
and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences
of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent
advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based
architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task.
Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT
model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We
address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU,
METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we
utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess
visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and
non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative
quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在NLP任务中潜力巨大，但由于高质量数据源的缺乏，其在移动设备上的应用受限。时间成本和人工标注的困难进一步加剧了这一问题。

Method: 开发AndroidGen框架，通过收集人类任务轨迹并训练开源LLM，无需依赖人工标注数据。

Result: 在AndroidWorld、AitW等平台上广泛评估，展示了AndroidGen的改进效果，并揭示了未来可能的优化方向。

Conclusion: AndroidGen为LLM在移动设备上的应用提供了有效解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Large language models have opened up a world of possibilities for various NLP
tasks, sparking optimism for the future. Despite their potential, LLMs have yet
to be widely used as agents on real mobile devices. The main challenge is the
need for high-quality data sources. Time constraints and labor intensity often
hinder human annotation. On the other hand, existing LLMs exhibit inadequate
completion rates and need a robust data filtration strategy. Given these
challenges, we develop a framework called AndroidGen to enhance the
capabilities of LLM-based agents under data scarcity. In addition, we leverage
AndroidGen to collect trajectories given human tasks and train open-source LLMs
on these trajectories to develop an open-source mobile agent without manually
labeled trajectories. We extensively evaluate AndroidGen with AndroidWorld,
AitW, and various popular applications, demonstrating its improvements and
revealing potential areas for future improvement. Code, model, and data are

TL;DR: BrowseComp-ZH是一个针对中文网络的高难度基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂中文信息生态系统中的检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注英文，忽略了中文网络的语言、基础设施和审查复杂性，因此需要专门的中文基准测试。

Method: BrowseComp-ZH包含289个多跳问题，覆盖11个领域，通过逆向工程从简短、客观且易验证的答案生成问题，并采用两阶段质量控制确保难度和答案唯一性。

Result: 测试了20多个先进语言模型和代理搜索系统，大多数模型表现不佳（准确率低于10%），最佳系统（OpenAI的DeepResearch）仅达到42.9%。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-ZH展示了当前模型在复杂检索和推理任务中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-using agents, the ability to
browse the web in real-time has become a critical yardstick for measuring their
reasoning and retrieval competence. Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp
concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and
censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most
notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a
high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents
on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning
11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short,
objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun).
A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question
difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art
language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH.
Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models
struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a
handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch,
reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of
BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies,
but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities
that current models still struggle to master. Our dataset, construction
guidelines, and benchmark results have been publicly released at

Motivation: 当前使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行行为防护存在延迟高、内存消耗大、成本高和非结构化输出等问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 任务特定数据生成训练分类器；2. 预训练多任务模型MultiTaskGuard；3. 提出基于搜索的模型合并方法UniGuard。

Result: 在多个数据集上，提出的方法平均F1分数比现有最佳模型Aegis-LlamaGuard和gpt-4o分别提高了29.92和21.62分。

Conclusion: 任务特定数据生成和模型合并方法能显著提升防护模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against
undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user
inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and
non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.
  In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to
fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art
(SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a
single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large
synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves
generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are
found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an
optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy
guardrail models. % On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created,
our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA
publicly available LLMs and 3$^{\text{rd}}$ party guardrail APIs in detecting
unsafe and safe behaviors by an average F1 score improvement of \textbf{29.92}

Motivation: 现有自动摘要方法未明确建模解释性内容，导致与人工摘要的匹配度不足。

Method: 采用两种话语驱动的计划策略，将计划作为输入或输出前缀的一部分。

Conclusion: 基于话语框架的计划方法能有效提升自动摘要的解释性和质量。

Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help
readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic
summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it
difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written
summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages
discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory
sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two
discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of
the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on
three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model
robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ICL CIPHERS方法，通过可逆密码转换任务，量化LLMs在上下文学习中的‘学习’能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦上下文学习中的任务检索和任务学习模式，探索LLMs是否能通过可逆密码解决任务。

Method: 引入基于密码学的可逆替换密码（ICL CIPHERS），将输入中的部分标记替换为无关标记，测试LLMs的解密能力。

Result: LLMs在可逆密码任务上表现优于不可逆基线，且在不同数据集和模型上表现一致。

Conclusion: ICL CIPHERS为量化上下文学习中的‘学习’提供了新方法，并揭示了LLMs的内部表示能力。

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual
modes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and
task learning (inference-time ``learning'' from demonstrations). However,
disentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL
CIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed
from classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the
in-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering
English sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there
is a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This
bijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task
in some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question
if LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires
deciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL
CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,
providing a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is
small, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.
Finally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in
their ability to decode the ciphered inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQG数据集依赖预定义的编辑文本，未能反映真实课堂内容（如讲座语音和幻灯片），导致生成的问题质量不高。

Result: 该方法显著提高了生成问题的质量和相关性。

Conclusion: 论文通过真实数据集和新框架，有效解决了EQG中的关键挑战，推动了智能教育系统的发展。

Abstract: Educational question generation (EQG) is a crucial component of intelligent
educational systems, significantly aiding self-assessment, active learning, and
personalized education. While EQG systems have emerged, existing datasets
typically rely on predefined, carefully edited texts, failing to represent
real-world classroom content, including lecture speech with a set of
complementary slides. To bridge this gap, we collect a dataset of educational
questions based on lectures from real-world classrooms. On this realistic
dataset, we find that current methods for EQG struggle with accurately
generating questions from educational videos, particularly in aligning with
specific timestamps and target answers. Common challenges include selecting
informative contexts from extensive transcripts and ensuring generated
questions meaningfully incorporate the target answer. To address the
challenges, we introduce a novel framework utilizing large language models for
dynamically selecting and rewriting contexts based on target timestamps and
answers. First, our framework selects contexts from both lecture transcripts
and video keyframes based on answer relevance and temporal proximity. Then, we
integrate the contexts selected from both modalities and rewrite them into
answer-containing knowledge statements, to enhance the logical connection
between the contexts and the desired answer. This approach significantly
improves the quality and relevance of the generated questions. Our dataset and
code are released in https://github.com/mengxiayu/COSER.

Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮对话中因固定上下文窗口难以保持一致性，Mem0通过内存中心架构解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Mem0及其基于图的增强版，动态提取、整合和检索对话信息，并在LOCOMO基准上对比六类基线方法。

Result: Mem0在四类问题上优于现有系统，性能提升26%，计算开销显著降低（延迟减少91%，token成本节省90%）。

Conclusion: 结构化持久内存机制对长期对话一致性至关重要，为高效可靠的LLM驱动AI代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in
generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows
pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged
multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric
architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting,
consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.
Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that
leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational
structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on
LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline
categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context
approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source
memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory
management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently
outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories:
single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26%
relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with
graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base
configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational
overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91%
lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling
balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment
constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent
memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for
more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.

Conclusion: 该方法在构建高质量语言生成系统方面具有广泛应用潜力和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the dynamic optimization of the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) architecture. It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge
retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling
efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and
complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive
retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching
path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative
optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively
addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and
knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset.
The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models,
including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments
from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and
ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and
generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document
fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical
value in building high-quality language generation systems.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在不同响应格式（二元与连续）下的判断偏差，以评估其在心理文本分析和决策任务中的可靠性。

Method: 通过价值判断任务和文本情感分析任务，测试多种LLMs在二元和连续响应格式下的表现。

Result: LLMs在二元格式下表现出一致的负面偏差，且这一现象在不同任务中均存在。

Conclusion: 任务设计中的响应格式选择对LLMs的判断有系统性影响，需谨慎考虑以避免偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks such as
psychological text analysis and decision-making in automated workflows.
However, their reliability remains a concern due to potential biases inherited
from their training process. In this study, we examine how different response
format: binary versus continuous, may systematically influence LLMs' judgments.
In a value statement judgments task and a text sentiment analysis task, we
prompted LLMs to simulate human responses and tested both formats across
several models, including both open-source and commercial models. Our findings
revealed a consistent negative bias: LLMs were more likely to deliver
"negative" judgments in binary formats compared to continuous ones. Control
experiments further revealed that this pattern holds across both tasks. Our
results highlight the importance of considering response format when applying
LLMs to decision tasks, as small changes in task design can introduce
systematic biases.

Result: 实验表明，该架构在多项指标上显著优于同类模型及基于LLM的模型，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决LLMs长上下文幻觉问题提供了有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various tasks. However, they are prone to contextual hallucination, generating
information that is either unsubstantiated or contradictory to the given
context. Although many studies have investigated contextual hallucinations in
LLMs, addressing them in long-context inputs remains an open problem. In this
work, we take an initial step toward solving this problem by constructing a
dataset specifically designed for long-context hallucination detection.
Furthermore, we propose a novel architecture that enables pre-trained encoder
models, such as BERT, to process long contexts and effectively detect
contextual hallucinations through a decomposition and aggregation mechanism.
Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly
outperforms previous models of similar size as well as LLM-based models across
various metrics, while providing substantially faster inference.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估在临床环境中有限，缺乏对真实电子健康记录（EHR）数据的复杂性捕捉。

Method: 提出BRIDGE基准，包含87个任务，评估52个LLM在不同推理策略下的表现。

Result: 开源LLM表现与专有模型相当，而基于旧架构的医学微调模型表现较差。

Conclusion: BRIDGE为临床文本理解的LLM开发和评估提供了基础资源和参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and
are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace.
However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most
existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived
text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record
(EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting
their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we
present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks
sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We
systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1,
GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total
of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation
across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical
specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve
performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs
based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose
models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational
resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs
in real-world clinical text understanding.

of situations, changes that need to be explained and dealt with, difficulties
in data annotation, and mistakes in generated outputs. In all cases,
disregarding the conflicts in data could result in undesired behaviors of
models and undermine NLP models' reliability and trustworthiness. This survey
categorizes these conflicts into three key areas: (1) natural texts on the web,
where factual inconsistencies, subjective biases, and multiple perspectives
introduce contradictions; (2) human-annotated data, where annotator
disagreements, mistakes, and societal biases impact model training; and (3)
model interactions, where hallucinations and knowledge conflicts emerge during
deployment. While prior work has addressed some of these conflicts in
isolation, we unify them under the broader concept of conflicting information,
analyze their implications, and discuss mitigation strategies. We highlight key
challenges and future directions for developing conflict-aware NLP systems that
can reason over and reconcile conflicting information more effectively.

### [45] [Detecting Effects of AI-Mediated Communication on Language Complexity and Sentiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19556)
*Kristen Sussman,Daniel Carter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过分析2020年和2024年关于特朗普的推文，发现AI介入社交媒体后，语言复杂度和情感极性显著变化，情感表达更积极。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型对社交媒体语言模式和情感表达的影响。

Method: 比较2020年（ChatGPT前）和2024年的推文数据集，使用Flesch-Kincaid可读性和极性评分分析文本复杂度和情感变化。

Result: 2024年推文的情感极性显著增加（0.12 vs. 0.04），中性内容减少（54.8%到39.8%），积极表达增加（28.6%到45.9%）。

Conclusion: AI在社交媒体中的介入不仅增加了其存在感，还显著影响了语言模式和情感表达。

Abstract: Given the subtle human-like effects of large language models on linguistic
patterns, this study examines shifts in language over time to detect the impact
of AI-mediated communication (AI- MC) on social media. We compare a replicated
dataset of 970,919 tweets from 2020 (pre-ChatGPT) with 20,000 tweets from the
same period in 2024, all of which mention Donald Trump during election periods.
Using a combination of Flesch-Kincaid readability and polarity scores, we
analyze changes in text complexity and sentiment. Our findings reveal a
significant increase in mean sentiment polarity (0.12 vs. 0.04) and a shift
from predominantly neutral content (54.8% in 2020 to 39.8% in 2024) to more
positive expressions (28.6% to 45.9%). These findings suggest not only an
increasing presence of AI in social media communication but also its impact on
language and emotional expression patterns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识驱动的多代理框架，用于生物医学领域的科学语料蒸馏，以提升大型语言模型（LLM）的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注科学语料库在数量和质量上不足，无法满足生物医学领域LLM训练的需求。

Method: 采用多代理协作架构，每个代理基于MeSH层次结构自主提取、合成和评估高质量文本数据，生成领域特定的问答对。

Result: 实验表明，基于该框架训练的LLM在生物医学问答任务中表现优异，甚至超越了一些先进专有模型。

Conclusion: 多代理协作框架在生物医学LLM训练中具有显著潜力，能够高效生成高质量数据集。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical research has
underscored the limitations of existing open-source annotated scientific
corpora, which are often insufficient in quantity and quality. Addressing the
challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a
knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation
tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is
a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided
by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to
autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data
from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine
domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and
consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement.
Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our
multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical
question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines
and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables
Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger
scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the
effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the
potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.

Abstract: Coreference resolution is a vital task in natural language processing (NLP)
that involves identifying and linking different expressions in a text that
refer to the same entity. This task is particularly challenging for Vietnamese,
a low-resource language with limited annotated datasets. To address these
challenges, we developed a comprehensive annotated dataset using narrative
texts from VnExpress, a widely-read Vietnamese online news platform. We
established detailed guidelines for annotating entities, focusing on ensuring
consistency and accuracy. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of large
language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, on this dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo in
terms of both accuracy and response consistency, making it a more reliable tool
for coreference resolution in Vietnamese.

TL;DR: VCM是一个自监督视觉概念建模框架，显著降低计算成本并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在图像处理上效率低下，缺乏视觉概念模型，限制了实际应用。

Method: VCM通过隐式对比学习和视觉语言微调，构建无需昂贵标注的视觉概念模型。

Result: VCM减少85%计算成本（如LLaVA-1.5-7B），并在多种图像理解任务中保持性能。

Conclusion: VCM有效提升视觉编码器能力，实验验证其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are pivotal for real-world AI tasks like
embodied intelligence due to their strong vision-language reasoning abilities.
However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is
inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at
the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort.
This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits
LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM,
an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages
implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and
vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without
requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM
significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for
LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image
understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in
classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.

Method: 收集了不同研究和库尔德语言学专家的词性标注，设计了一个标准化的标注集，并与通用依赖框架进行比较。

Result: 提出的词性标注集能够更准确地处理库尔德语句子，支持NLP任务。

Conclusion: 该标注集为库尔德语的NLP任务提供了更好的基础，未来可进一步优化和应用。

Abstract: - The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded
within the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via
NLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text
generation and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity
Recognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the
Central-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of
necessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the
base of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to
standardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the
sentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.
Specifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are
neither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an
accurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance
of the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from
different studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized
part-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large
CKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this
study via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard
languages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct
sentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的时间序列预测方法主要关注单模态数值序列，忽略了时间序列数据中的多模态信息。MCD-TSF旨在利用时间戳和文本作为额外指导信息，提升预测效果。

Method: MCD-TSF结合时间戳建立时间序列的时空和语义关联，并利用文本作为历史数据的补充描述，通过无分类器方式动态对齐和控制。

Result: 在八个领域的真实世界基准数据集上，MCD-TSF表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCD-TSF通过多模态信息的联合利用，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text,
and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting
(TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling
single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal
information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for
prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF,
namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for
time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are
combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among
different data points when aggregating information along the temporal
dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history,
and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a
classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets
across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Generative AI have achieved remarkable
progress, evolving into sophisticated and versatile tools widely adopted across
various domains and applications. However, the substantial memory overhead
caused by their vast number of parameters, combined with the high computational
demands of the attention mechanism, poses significant challenges in achieving

advancements, driven by groundbreaking research, have significantly accelerated
progress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of these
methods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level
strategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important
areas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling,
decoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation
paradigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment,
multi-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging
scenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and
auxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several
niche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to
further advance the field of LLM inference serving.

Result: 上下文一致性检查显著提升了准确性，且行为预测的准确性高于事件预测。

Conclusion: 本研究为对话数据自动编码提供了新方法框架，并解决了对话分析中的上下文挑战。

Abstract: Dialogue data has been a key source for understanding learning processes,
offering critical insights into how students engage in collaborative
discussions and how these interactions shape their knowledge construction. The
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities
for advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of
dialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents
unique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and
interpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these
challenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for
dialogue data. The novelty of our proposed framework is threefold: 1) We
predict the code for an utterance based on dialogue-specific characteristics --
communicative acts and communicative events -- using separate prompts following
the role prompts and chain-of-thoughts methods; 2) We engaged multiple LLMs
including GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, DeepSeek in collaborative code prediction; 3) We
leveraged the interrelation between events and acts to implement consistency
checking using GPT-4o. In particular, our contextual consistency checking
provided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act
predictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions. This study
contributes a new methodological framework for enhancing the precision of
automated coding of dialogue data as well as offers a scalable solution for
addressing the contextual challenges inherent in dialogue analysis.

performance degrades with increasing context complexity, particularly for
low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. We further fine-tune the open-source

Surprisingly, low-resource languages have a stronger impact on multilingual
reasoning than high-resource ones, highlighting their critical role in
multilingual NLP.

Motivation: 减少LLM开发中的计算成本和开发时间，传统方法忽略了模型间的谱系关系。

Method: 提出Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization（LRMF），利用图拉普拉斯正则化编码模型间的谱系关系。

Result: 在2934个模型和21000+实例的实验中，LRMF比基线方法相关性提高7-10个百分点，并能有效解决冷启动问题。

Conclusion: LRMF为LLM开发提供了一种资源高效的性能预测方法，有助于超参数调优和数据选择。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before
extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational
expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws
account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they
often overlook explicit lineage relationships - i.e., which models are derived
or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel
Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes
ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging
multi-hop parent-child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional
matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level
and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes
2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6
major benchmarks, showing that lineage constraints yield up to 7-10 percentage
points higher correlation with actual performance compared to baselines.
Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate
estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This
lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform
hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM
development.

Conclusion: 翻译创造性对认知负荷的影响是新的发现，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This article presents the results of a pilot study involving the reception of
a fictional short story translated from English into Dutch under four
conditions: machine translation (MT), post-editing (PE), human translation (HT)
and original source text (ST). The aim is to understand how creativity and
errors in different translation modalities affect readers, specifically
regarding cognitive load. Eight participants filled in a questionnaire, read a
story using an eye-tracker, and conducted a retrospective think-aloud (RTA)
interview. The results show that units of creative potential (UCP) increase
cognitive load and that this effect is highest for HT and lowest for MT; no
effect of error was observed. Triangulating the data with RTAs leads us to
hypothesize that the higher cognitive load in UCPs is linked to increases in
reader enjoyment and immersion. The effect of translation creativity on
cognitive load in different translation modalities at word-level is novel and
opens up new avenues for further research. All the code and data are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域自适应持续预训练（DAPT）需要大量领域相关数据，但在非英语语言（如德语）的特定领域（如流程工业）中难以获取。

Method: 采用ICL和kNN方法，通过增强目标数据中的领域相关文本，减少计算需求。

Result: ICL-APT在平均IR指标上比传统DAPT高出3.5，计算时间减少近4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算资源有限的行业提供了经济高效的解决方案，并适用于其他低资源领域。

Abstract: Domain-adaptive continual pretraining (DAPT) is a state-of-the-art technique
that further trains a language model (LM) on its pretraining task, e.g.,
language masking. Although popular, it requires a significant corpus of
domain-related data, which is difficult to obtain for specific domains in
languages other than English, such as the process industry in the German
language. This paper introduces an efficient approach called ICL-augmented
pretraining or ICL-APT that leverages in-context learning (ICL) and k-nearest
neighbors (kNN) to augment target data with domain-related and in-domain texts,
significantly reducing GPU time while maintaining strong model performance. Our
results show that this approach performs better than traditional DAPT by 3.5 of
the average IR metrics (e.g., mAP, MRR, and nDCG) and requires almost 4 times
less computing time, providing a cost-effective solution for industries with
limited computational capacity. The findings highlight the broader
applicability of this framework to other low-resource industries, making
NLP-based solutions more accessible and feasible in production environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型LLM服务系统semi-PD，通过分离计算与统一存储解决现有系统中的存储效率问题，显著提升高请求率下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统存在存储效率低下的问题，如权重复制、KV缓存传输开销等，导致高请求率下性能不佳。

Method: 设计semi-PD系统，分离计算资源（SM级别）并统一存储管理，引入资源控制器和动态分区算法。

Result: 在DeepSeek和Llama模型上，semi-PD显著降低延迟并提升请求处理能力。

Conclusion: semi-PD通过计算分离与存储统一的创新设计，解决了存储效率问题，优化了LLM服务性能。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories:
1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the
same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a
disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs.
The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and
sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage
challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent
flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3)
storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and
4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV
cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high
request rates.
  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system
lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational
resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose
a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation
and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller
to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)
level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access
from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism
between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic
partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to
state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request
rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on
DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency
constraints on Llama series models.

TL;DR: GenCLS++是一个联合优化监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的框架，通过系统探索五种策略维度，显著提升生成式文本分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统判别方法忽视了大型语言模型（LLMs）的生成能力，而现有研究仅依赖简单的监督微调（SFT），未充分利用RL和推理提示的潜力。

Method: GenCLS++联合优化SFT和RL，探索五种策略维度（如上下文学习变体、类别定义等），并通过RL进一步优化。

Result: 在七个数据集上平均准确率提升3.46%，公开数据集上提升4.00%。分类任务无需显式推理步骤即可表现更好。

Conclusion: GenCLS++为生成式文本分类提供了统一框架，并揭示了显式推理在分类任务中的局限性，为未来LLM应用提供了指导。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in machine learning, text classification plays a
crucial role in many areas. With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models
(LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing
need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification
are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs.
Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs'
intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by
prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still
rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and
inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative
text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one
framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes
SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy
dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit
uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and
perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT
"policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable
extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets,
this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that
benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks
perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of
explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用LLM驱动的生成代理在众包事实核查任务中的潜力，发现其在真实性分类、一致性和抗偏见方面优于人类众包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线错误信息的蔓延需要可扩展且可靠的事实核查解决方案，而众包事实核查虽成本低但存在质量和偏见问题。LLM在事实核查任务中表现优异，但其在众包工作流中的作用尚未研究。

Method: 使用La Barbera等人的协议，模拟具有多样化人口和意识形态特征的生成代理群，进行证据检索、声明评估和真实性判断。

Result: 生成代理群在真实性分类上优于人类群，表现出更高的一致性和更低的偏见倾向，决策过程更结构化。

Conclusion: 生成代理可作为众包事实核查系统中可扩展、一致且偏见较少的贡献者。

Abstract: The growing spread of online misinformation has created an urgent need for
scalable, reliable fact-checking solutions. Crowdsourced fact-checking - where
non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to
expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias.
Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X
(formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from
centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.
  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and
evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows
remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative
agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making -
can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for
human crowds. Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate
crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles.
Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and
issue final veracity judgments.
  Our results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness
classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced
susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely
more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and
Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall,
our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable,
consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: TD-EVAL是一个两阶段评估框架，结合细粒度轮次级分析和整体对话级比较，用于评估任务导向对话系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评估方法无法检测用户与代理交互中的关键中间错误，需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 提出TD-EVAL框架，包括轮次级评估（对话连贯性、后端知识一致性和策略合规性）和对话级比较（TOD Agent Arena）。

Result: 实验表明TD-EVAL能有效识别传统指标遗漏的错误，且比传统和LLM指标更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: TD-EVAL为任务导向对话系统评估提供了新范式，支持轮次和系统级评估，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these
systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional
automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus
solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors
that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce
TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework
that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level
comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific
dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy
compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons
to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ
2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the
conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL
exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based
metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for
TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a
plug-and-play framework for future research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在电信领域问答任务中，知识蒸馏（KD）中教师模型和学生模型的领域适应性问题，发现教师模型的监督微调（SFT）能提升蒸馏效果，而同时微调两者效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在领域特定任务中，教师模型、学生模型或两者的领域适应对知识蒸馏效果的影响。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）教师模型、学生模型或两者，结合不同词汇表和蒸馏算法（如普通KD和双空间KD），进行系统实验。

Result: 教师模型的SFT在相同词汇表时能提升蒸馏效果，同时微调两者效果最佳，但统计显著性取决于教师模型的词汇表。

Conclusion: 在领域特定任务中，同时微调教师和学生模型能获得最佳蒸馏效果，但需考虑词汇表的影响。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the approaches to reduce the size of
Large Language Models (LLMs). A LLM with smaller number of model parameters
(student) is trained to mimic the performance of a LLM of a larger size
(teacher model) on a specific task. For domain-specific tasks, it is not clear
if teacher or student model, or both, must be considered for domain adaptation.
In this work, we study this problem from perspective of telecom domain
Question-Answering (QA) task. We systematically experiment with Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT) of teacher only, SFT of student only and SFT of both prior to
KD. We design experiments to study the impact of vocabulary (same and
different) and KD algorithms (vanilla KD and Dual Space KD, DSKD) on the
distilled model. Multi-faceted evaluation of the distillation using 14
different metrics (N-gram, embedding and LLM-based metrics) is considered.
Experimental results show that SFT of teacher improves performance of distilled
model when both models have same vocabulary, irrespective of algorithm and
metrics. Overall, SFT of both teacher and student results in better performance
across all metrics, although the statistical significance of the same depends
on the vocabulary of the teacher models.

Conclusion: 讨论了LLM假新闻的威胁，呼吁利益相关者采取对策以维护新闻生态系统的完整性。

Abstract: Online fake news moderation now faces a new challenge brought by the
malicious use of large language models (LLMs) in fake news production. Though
existing works have shown LLM-generated fake news is hard to detect from an
individual aspect, it remains underexplored how its large-scale release will
impact the news ecosystem. In this study, we develop a simulation pipeline and
a dataset with ~56k generated news of diverse types to investigate the effects
of LLM-generated fake news within neural news recommendation systems. Our
findings expose a truth decay phenomenon, where real news is gradually losing
its advantageous position in news ranking against fake news as LLM-generated
news is involved in news recommendation. We further provide an explanation
about why truth decay occurs from a familiarity perspective and show the
positive correlation between perplexity and news ranking. Finally, we discuss
the threats of LLM-generated fake news and provide possible countermeasures. We
urge stakeholders to address this emerging challenge to preserve the integrity
of news ecosystems.

Result: 模型在英语中表现更优，印度语言中更容易出现幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言中的理解和事实准确性仍需改进。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
effectiveness across various languages, particularly in high-resource languages
such as English. However, their performance in terms of factual accuracy across
other low-resource languages, especially Indic languages, remains an area of
investigation. In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o,
Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in
English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains
question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same
questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze
whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic
languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often
perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts.
Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated
in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual
understanding capabilities of current LLMs.

TL;DR: AutoJudge框架通过任务特定的有损推测解码加速LLM推理，通过识别不影响下游质量的“不重要”令牌以提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码要求令牌级匹配，效率较低。AutoJudge通过放松对不重要令牌的匹配要求，提高推理速度。

Method: 采用半贪婪搜索算法识别需纠正的令牌，并训练轻量级分类器预测可安全接受的令牌。

Result: 在GSM8K推理任务中，AutoJudge比标准推测解码多接受1.5倍令牌，准确率下降低于1%。在编程任务中同样有效。

Conclusion: AutoJudge能跨任务泛化，显著提升LLM推理速度且几乎不影响质量。

Abstract: We introduce AutoJudge, a framework that accelerates large language model
(LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of
matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify
which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the generated
response, relaxing the guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be
generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test
which of the mismatches between target and draft model should be corrected to
preserve quality, and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight
classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time,
which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final
answer quality. We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B
(target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more
accepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer
accuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss
in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach
automatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows
similar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种认知-机制框架（COGMIF），通过结合ACT-R数字孪生和TimeGAN增强模拟，改进了传统HRA方法IDHEAS-ECA，解决了认知基础不足和实验资源受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HRA方法依赖专家判断和经验规则，忽视了人类错误的认知基础，且新型核电站的实验难以实施。

Method: 提出COGMIF框架，整合ACT-R数字孪生模拟操作员认知，并使用TimeGAN生成高保真合成数据，驱动IDHEAS-ECA评估。

Result: 通过比较SPAR-H和敏感性分析，验证了COGMIF的稳健性和实用性，并量化了操作风险的关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: COGMIF为将认知理论融入工业HRA实践提供了可信且高效的计算途径。

Abstract: Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA,
rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive
underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop
experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due
to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a
cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA
methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with
TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition,
including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and
perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource
constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on
ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator
behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA
assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error
probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity
assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed
COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to
quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of
operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient
pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.

Abstract: With the timely formation of personalized intervention plans based on
high-dimensional heterogeneous time series information becoming an important
challenge in the medical field today, electronic medical records, wearables,
and other multi-source medical data are increasingly generated and diversified.
In this work, we develop a system to generate personalized medical intervention
strategies based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Time-Series
Data Fusion. First, by incorporating relative policy constraints among the
groups during policy gradient updates, we adaptively balance individual and
group gains. To improve the robustness and interpretability of decision-making,
a multi-layer neural network structure is employed to group-code patient
characteristics. Second, for the rapid multi-modal fusion of multi-source
heterogeneous time series, a multi-channel neural network combined with a
self-attention mechanism is used for dynamic feature extraction. Key feature
screening and aggregation are achieved through a differentiable gating network.
Finally, a collaborative search process combining a genetic algorithm and Monte
Carlo tree search is proposed to find the ideal intervention strategy,
achieving global optimization. Experimental results show significant
improvements in accuracy, coverage, and decision-making benefits compared with
existing methods.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型如ChatGPT-4在物种名称管理中有潜力，尽管存在局限，但能显著提升分类任务和本体开发的效率。

Abstract: Managing scientific names in ontologies that represent species taxonomies is
challenging due to the ever-evolving nature of these taxonomies. Manually
maintaining these names becomes increasingly difficult when dealing with
thousands of scientific names. To address this issue, this paper investigates
the use of ChatGPT-4 to automate the development of the :Organism module in the
Agricultural Product Types Ontology (APTO) for species classification. Our
methodology involved leveraging ChatGPT-4 to extract data from the GBIF
Backbone API and generate OWL files for further integration in APTO. Two
alternative approaches were explored: (1) issuing a series of prompts for
ChatGPT-4 to execute tasks via the BrowserOP plugin and (2) directing ChatGPT-4
to design a Python algorithm to perform analogous tasks. Both approaches rely
on a prompting method where we provide instructions, context, input data, and
an output indicator. The first approach showed scalability limitations, while
the second approach used the Python algorithm to overcome these challenges, but
it struggled with typographical errors in data handling. This study highlights
the potential of Large language models like ChatGPT-4 to streamline the
management of species names in ontologies. Despite certain limitations, these
tools offer promising advancements in automating taxonomy-related tasks and
improving the efficiency of ontology development.

Abstract: Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) detection presents significant challenges
due to the subtle and often ambiguous presentation of symptoms in medical
imaging, making accurate diagnosis a complex task. To address these challenges,
we propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates
multiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large
language model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models
using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI
symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through
a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions
from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a
model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the
most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between
the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final
decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This
end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model
consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt
engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was
developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport
News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models. The
results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned
vision-language model inputs with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM to create a
robust, secure, and highly accurate diagnostic system for mild TBI prediction.
To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first application of
fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM for TBI
prediction tasks.

Motivation: 利用任务固有的层次结构，验证HRL在稀疏奖励任务中是否优于传统强化学习算法。

Method: 设计实验对比PPO与HRL，测试子目标生成方式（手动vs自动）和终止频率对性能的影响。

Result: HRL在复杂导航任务中表现更优，展示了其在子目标生成和终止功能上的优势。

Conclusion: HRL通过子目标生成和终止功能，在稀疏奖励任务中显著优于传统强化学习。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is hypothesized to be able to take
advantage of the inherent hierarchy in robot learning tasks with sparse reward
schemes, in contrast to more traditional reinforcement learning algorithms. In
this research, hierarchical reinforcement learning is evaluated and contrasted
with standard reinforcement learning in complex navigation tasks. We evaluate
unique characteristics of HRL, including their ability to create sub-goals and
the termination function. We constructed experiments to test the differences
between PPO and HRL, different ways of creating sub-goals, manual vs automatic
sub-goal creation, and the effects of the frequency of termination on
performance. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL and how it
achieves these advantages.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) builds upon Generative AI (GenAI). It
constitutes the next major step in the evolution of AI with much stronger
reasoning and interaction capabilities that enable more autonomous behavior to
tackle complex tasks. Since the initial release of ChatGPT (3.5), Generative AI
has seen widespread adoption, giving users firsthand experience. However, the
distinction between Agentic AI and GenAI remains less well understood. To
address this gap, our survey is structured in two parts. In the first part, we
compare GenAI and Agentic AI using existing literature, discussing their key
characteristics, how Agentic AI remedies limitations of GenAI, and the major
steps in GenAI's evolution toward Agentic AI. This section is intended for a
broad audience, including academics in both social sciences and engineering, as
well as industry professionals. It provides the necessary insights to
comprehend novel applications that are possible with Agentic AI but not with
GenAI. In the second part, we deep dive into novel aspects of Agentic AI,
including recent developments and practical concerns such as defining agents.
Finally, we discuss several challenges that could serve as a future research
agenda, while cautioning against risks that can emerge when exceeding human
intelligence.

Motivation: MOF合成条件复杂且多样，传统方法难以高效确定最佳条件。

Method: 集成多种MOF相关代理（如合成、属性和化学信息代理），利用LLM（gpt-4o-mini）作为核心代理，开发MOFh6工具。

Result: MOFh6支持多格式查询，提供最优合成条件并生成预建模文件。

Conclusion: MOFh6有望提升MOF合成研究的效率。

Abstract: The mining of synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a
significant focus in materials science. However, identifying the precise
synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities
presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a
promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs,
specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related
agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This
integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to
streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple
formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific
MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide
optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional
theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF
synthesis of all researchers.

Abstract: Initiation, monitoring, and evaluation of development programmes can involve
field-based data collection about project activities. This data collection
through digital devices may not always be feasible though, for reasons such as
unaffordability of smartphones and tablets by field-based cadre, or shortfalls
in their training and capacity building. Paper-based data collection has been
argued to be more appropriate in several contexts, with automated digitization
of the paper forms through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and OMR (Optical
Mark Recognition) techniques. We contribute with providing a large dataset of
handwritten digits, and deep learning based models and methods built using this
data, that are effective in real-world environments. We demonstrate the
deployment of these tools in the context of a maternal and child health and
nutrition awareness project, which uses IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
systems to provide awareness information to rural women SHG (Self Help Group)
members in north India. Paper forms were used to collect phone numbers of the
SHG members at scale, which were digitized using the OCR tools developed by us,
and used to push almost 4 million phone calls. The data, model, and code have
been released in the open-source domain.

Result: 发现两个新现象：长度依赖的机械交叉和链长/二级结构稳定性图，揭示了新的肽力学设计原则和β-折叠结构的稳定性特征。

Conclusion: Sparks能够独立进行严谨的科学探究，并识别出未知的科学原理。

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet
most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We
present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire
discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and
iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without
human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously
unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby
beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond
~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and
(ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly
robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance
in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed
reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy
structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired
generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility.
The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific
inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.

Motivation: 现有语义推理器计算成本高且效率随本体规模下降，传统机器学习模型难以捕捉本体复杂关系，而大语言模型在结构化推理上表现不佳。

Method: 将OWL本体转换为图结构数据，并采用GLM架构进行一致性检查。

Result: 在NCBO BioPortal本体上测试，GLaMoR准确率达95%，速度比传统推理器快20倍。

Conclusion: GLaMoR为高效本体一致性检查提供了新方法，结合了图结构与语言模型的优势。

Abstract: Semantic reasoning aims to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge, with
OWL ontologies serving as a standardized framework for organizing information.
A key challenge in semantic reasoning is verifying ontology consistency.
However, state-of-the-art reasoners are computationally expensive, and their
efficiency decreases as ontology sizes grow. While classical machine learning
models have been explored for consistency checking, they struggle to capture
complex relationships within ontologies. Large language models (LLMs) have
shown promising results for simple reasoning tasks but perform poorly on
structured reasoning. The recently introduced Graph Language Model (GLM) offers
a way to simultaneously process graph-structured data and text. This paper
proposes GLaMoR (Graph Language Model for Reasoning), a reasoning pipeline that
transforms OWL ontologies into graph-structured data and adapts the GLM
architecture for consistency checking. We evaluate GLaMoR on ontologies from
the NCBO BioPortal repository, converting them into triples suitable for model
input. Our results show that the GLM outperforms all baseline models, achieving
$95\%$ accuracy while being 20 times faster than classical reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法在平衡邻近性、多样性和鲁棒性方面存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入基于Dice-Sorensen系数的鲁棒性指标，并使用加权损失组件（lambda_p、lambda_d、lambda_r）优化反事实生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和ML后端上验证，DiCE-Extended在有效性、稳定性和决策边界对齐方面优于标准DiCE。

Conclusion: DiCE-Extended为高风险应用提供了更可靠和可解释的反事实解释，未来将探索自适应优化和领域特定约束。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law.
Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with
actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that
lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF
generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and
robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted
framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but
lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain
constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an
enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization
techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our
approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-Sorensen
coefficient, ensuring stability under small input variations. Additionally, we
refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d,
lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically
validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German
Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch,
TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment
with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our
findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable
and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work will explore
adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further
enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出ChiseLLM，通过数据处理、提示引导推理轨迹合成和领域适应模型训练，显著提升了Chisel代码生成的语法正确性和设计变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着领域特定架构（DSA）需求的增长，敏捷硬件开发方法（AHDM）需要高效的硬件构造语言（HCL）支持，但现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在Chisel生成任务中面临语法正确性和设计变异性的挑战。

Method: ChiseLLM通过数据处理与转换、提示引导推理轨迹合成和领域适应模型训练，构建高质量数据集并优化模型推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，ChiseLLM-7B和ChiseLLM-32B模型分别将语法正确性提升18.85%和26.32%，设计变异性能力提升47.58%。

Conclusion: ChiseLLM为HCL-Based AHDM提供了高性能、低成本的解决方案，并为未来研究提供了有效基准。

Abstract: The growing demand for Domain-Specific Architecture (DSA) has driven the
development of Agile Hardware Development Methodology (AHDM). Hardware
Construction Language (HCL) like Chisel offers high-level abstraction features,
making it an ideal language for HCL-Based AHDM. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) excel in code generation tasks, they still face challenges with Chisel
generation, particularly regarding syntax correctness and design variability.
Recent reasoning models have significantly enhanced code generation
capabilities through test-time scaling techniques. However, we found that
reasoning models without domain adaptation cannot bring substantial benefits to
Chisel code generation tasks. This paper presents ChiseLLM, a solution
comprising data processing and transformation, prompt-guided reasoning trace
synthesis, and domain-adapted model training. We constructed high-quality
datasets from public RTL code resources and guided the model to adopt
structured thinking patterns through prompt enhancement methods. Experiments
demonstrate that our ChiseLLM-7B and ChiseLLM-32B models improved syntax
correctness by 18.85% and 26.32% respectively over base models, while
increasing variability design ability by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning
models. Our datasets and models are publicly available, providing
high-performance, cost-effective models for HCL-Based AHDM, and offering an
effective baseline for future research. Github repository:

Motivation: 解决高维数据在神经模糊推理系统中的挑战，同时保持性能和可解释性。

Method: 集成双权重机制（属性和规则权重）及自动增长/剪枝策略，动态优化模糊模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得更低RMSE，如北京PM2.5数据集RMSE为56.87，优于ANFIS和SOFENN。

Conclusion: ADAR能动态平衡规则复杂性和特征重要性，适用于高精度、可扩展且透明的神经模糊系统。

Abstract: This paper presents an Adaptive Dynamic Attribute and Rule (ADAR) framework
designed to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in
neuro-fuzzy inference systems. By integrating dual weighting
mechanisms-assigning adaptive importance to both attributes and rules-together
with automated growth and pruning strategies, ADAR adaptively streamlines
complex fuzzy models without sacrificing performance or interpretability.
Experimental evaluations on four diverse datasets - Auto MPG (7 variables),
Beijing PM2.5 (10 variables), Boston Housing (13 variables), and Appliances
Energy Consumption (27 variables) show that ADAR-based models achieve
consistently lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. On the Beijing PM2.5 dataset, for instance, ADAR-SOFENN attained an
RMSE of 56.87 with nine rules, surpassing traditional ANFIS [12] and SOFENN
[16] models. Similarly, on the high-dimensional Appliances Energy dataset,
ADAR-ANFIS reached an RMSE of 83.25 with nine rules, outperforming established
fuzzy logic approaches and interpretability-focused methods such as APLR.
Ablation studies further reveal that combining rule-level and attribute-level
weight assignment significantly reduces model overlap while preserving
essential features, thereby enhancing explainability. These results highlight
ADAR's effectiveness in dynamically balancing rule complexity and feature
importance, paving the way for scalable, high-accuracy, and transparent
neuro-fuzzy systems applicable to a range of real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 医疗AI的广泛应用受限于技术性能之外的挑战，如伦理问题、监管障碍和缺乏信任。

Method: 提出一个设计框架，为不同医疗流程中的利益相关者制定一套通用的TAI要求，并以心血管疾病为例说明应用。

Result: 框架为医疗AI系统开发者提供了具体的TAI实施指南，并识别了实践中的挑战与权衡。

Conclusion: 通过将TAI原则融入医疗AI系统设计，可以促进其临床采用，但仍需解决实践中的复杂性和多样性问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare,
particularly in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and patient care. The increasing
availability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and
electronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI
models to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical
adoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical
performance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of
trust. To address these issues, AI systems must align with the principles of
Trustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic
robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination
avoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes
(e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of
stakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the
integration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and
practical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support
developers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each
stakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a
disease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should
incorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the
challenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in
practice. To ground the discussion, we focus on cardiovascular diseases, a
field marked by both high prevalence and active AI innovation, and demonstrate
how TAI principles have been applied and where key obstacles persist.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在重要决策中的应用增加，系统评估其伦理推理能力变得至关重要。

Method: 采用PRIME框架，结合直接提问和伦理困境分析，评估六种主流LLMs。

Result: 模型在关怀/伤害和公平/欺骗维度上表现一致，但在其他维度较弱，且与人类道德偏好相符。

Conclusion: PRIME框架为伦理评估提供了可扩展方法，揭示了当前AI伦理推理的潜力与局限。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential
decision-making contexts, systematically assessing their ethical reasoning
capabilities becomes a critical imperative. This paper introduces the
Priorities in Reasoning and Intrinsic Moral Evaluation (PRIME) framework--a
comprehensive methodology for analyzing moral priorities across foundational
ethical dimensions including consequentialist-deontological reasoning, moral
foundations theory, and Kohlberg's developmental stages. We apply this
framework to six leading LLMs through a dual-protocol approach combining direct
questioning and response analysis to established ethical dilemmas. Our analysis
reveals striking patterns of convergence: all evaluated models demonstrate
strong prioritization of care/harm and fairness/cheating foundations while
consistently underweighting authority, loyalty, and sanctity dimensions.
Through detailed examination of confidence metrics, response reluctance
patterns, and reasoning consistency, we establish that contemporary LLMs (1)
produce decisive ethical judgments, (2) demonstrate notable cross-model
alignment in moral decision-making, and (3) generally correspond with
empirically established human moral preferences. This research contributes a
scalable, extensible methodology for ethical benchmarking while highlighting
both the promising capabilities and systematic limitations in current AI moral
reasoning architectures--insights critical for responsible development as these
systems assume increasingly significant societal roles.

TL;DR: SLMs在生成函数调用任务中表现良好，尤其在微调后效果最佳，但在输出格式一致性上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SLMs在资源受限环境下生成函数调用的潜力，以替代计算成本高的LLMs。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和微调方法，结合提示注入，评估SLMs在不同领域的表现，并在边缘设备上测试延迟和内存使用。

Result: SLMs在微调后表现最佳，但对输出格式的遵守较差；提示注入实验显示模型鲁棒性较好。

Conclusion: SLMs在函数调用生成任务中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升实时性能。

Abstract: Function calling is a complex task with widespread applications in domains
such as information retrieval, software engineering and automation. For
example, a query to book the shortest flight from New York to London on January
15 requires identifying the correct parameters to generate accurate function
calls. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process but are
computationally expensive and impractical in resource-constrained settings. In
contrast, Small Language Models (SLMs) can operate efficiently, offering faster
response times, and lower computational demands, making them potential
candidates for function calling on edge devices. In this exploratory empirical
study, we evaluate the efficacy of SLMs in generating function calls across
diverse domains using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches, both
with and without prompt injection, while also providing the finetuned models to
facilitate future applications. Furthermore, we analyze the model responses
across a range of metrics, capturing various aspects of function call
generation. Additionally, we perform experiments on an edge device to evaluate
their performance in terms of latency and memory usage, providing useful
insights into their practical applicability. Our findings show that while SLMs
improve from zero-shot to few-shot and perform best with fine-tuning, they
struggle significantly with adhering to the given output format. Prompt
injection experiments further indicate that the models are generally robust and
exhibit only a slight decline in performance. While SLMs demonstrate potential
for the function call generation task, our results also highlight areas that
need further refinement for real-time functioning.

Method: 采用Johnstone的上下文项和公式序列演算，开发了前向链和范式算法，支持Horn逻辑的笛卡尔范畴对象推理，并改进了多类理论、上下文和一阶逻辑片段的一阶统一算法。

Result: 这些方法能够应用于不支持经典逻辑或其所有连接词的语义范畴中的对象推理。

Conclusion: 研究表明，范畴逻辑方法为AI代理的符号推理提供了新的可能性，尤其是在非经典逻辑环境中。

Abstract: This paper seeks to apply categorical logic to the design of artificial
intelligent agents that reason symbolically about objects more richly
structured than sets. Using Johnstone's sequent calculus of terms- and
formulae-in-context, we develop forward chaining and normal form algorithms for
reasoning about objects in cartesian categories with the rules for Horn logic.
We also adapt first-order unification to support multi-sorted theories,
contexts, and fragments of first-order logic. The significance of these
reformulations rests in the fact that they can be applied to reasoning about
objects in semantic categories that do not support classical logic or even all
its connectives.

Result: 在五个数据集上优于七个基线方法，生成更简洁、高质量的规则集，并显著减少执行时间。

Conclusion: Aerial+在关联规则挖掘中表现出色，适用于可解释机器学习模型。

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data
features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of
domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number
of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task
performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM
research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM
method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural
representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It
extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's
reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven
baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by
learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When
integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+
significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图强化学习（GRL）的QoS感知负载均衡方法，用于优化多频段O-RAN中GBR和BE流量的性能，显著减少了QoS违规并提升了BE流量的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线网络需要满足严格的QoS要求，而防止小区拥塞是实现这一目标的关键挑战。

Method: 采用图强化学习（GRL）框架，将负载均衡问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，状态表示为图，并结合QoS约束设计奖励信号。使用基于GNN的Dueling DQN训练负载均衡策略。

Conclusion: GRL框架在多频段O-RAN中有效优化了负载均衡，显著提升了QoS和BE流量的性能。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide
unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications,
necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data
rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention
of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient
radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User
Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach
is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best
Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS
and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement
Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural
Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process,
with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both
state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained
using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based
architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of
nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of
accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the
GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show
substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations
and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.

TL;DR: GVPO是一种新的后训练方法，通过将KL约束奖励最大化的解析解直接融入梯度权重中，解决了现有方法训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法（如GRPO）虽性能优越，但存在训练不稳定的问题，限制了实际应用。GVPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GVPO将KL约束奖励最大化的解析解直接融入梯度权重，其梯度反映了隐式奖励与实际奖励的中心距离的均方误差。

Result: GVPO保证了唯一最优解（即KL约束奖励最大化目标），并支持灵活的采样分布，避免了传统方法的局限性。

Conclusion: GVPO通过理论保证与实践适应性相结合，为LLM后训练提供了可靠且灵活的新范式。

Abstract: Post-training plays a crucial role in refining and aligning large language
models to meet specific tasks and human preferences. While recent advancements
in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior
performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits
their practical adoption. To address this challenge, we present Group Variance
Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to
KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring
alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical
interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the
central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers
two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the
KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling
distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By
unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a
new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.

*Minsu Kim,Sangryul Kim,James Thorne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文从贝叶斯认识论的角度研究了语言模型的知识，发现语言模型在不同证据类型下未能完全遵循贝叶斯假设，且高置信度并不总是对应高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型如何根据证据的信息量和可靠性调整其置信度和响应，以理解其知识获取和推理能力。

Method: 创建包含多种证据类型的数据集，通过语言模型的置信度表达、标记概率和采样分析其响应。

Result: 语言模型在真实证据下遵循贝叶斯确认假设，但在其他证据类型下表现不一致；高置信度不一定对应高准确性，且对黄金证据存在偏好。

Conclusion: 语言模型在贝叶斯假设下的表现不一致，揭示了其推理偏差和局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper investigates the knowledge of language models from the perspective
of Bayesian epistemology. We explore how language models adjust their
confidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of
informativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset
with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and
confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We
observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology:
language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true
evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering
different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can
exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always
guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are
biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the
degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian
assumptions.

Motivation: 研究LLM在算法搜索中的适应度景观，以更好地理解搜索行为并优化LAS方法。

Method: 采用图论方法，节点表示算法，边表示算法间的转换，并在六种算法设计任务和六种LLM上进行评估。

Result: LAS景观具有高度多模态和崎岖特性，任务类型和LLM选择显著影响景观结构。种群大小影响探索与开发的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对LAS景观的理解，并为设计更有效的LAS方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
algorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative
algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding
search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and
analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a
graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote
transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm
design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS
landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial
optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs.
For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing
algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered
distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences
exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite
algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes
but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.

Abstract: Large language models and autonomous AI agents have evolved rapidly,
resulting in a diverse array of evaluation benchmarks, frameworks, and
collaboration protocols. However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a
unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side
comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these
models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy
of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge
reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software
engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations,
multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments.
Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025
that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous
decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world
applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research,
academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical
reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems,
multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent
collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the
Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally,
we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning
strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific
discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated
search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous
agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and
reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based
systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and
conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software
capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug
discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate
the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem
resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to
independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for
identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while
navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in
a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025,
a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse
strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep
Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the
benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles,
and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While
promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed
solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and
current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery
and broader scientific research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的决策支持系统（DSS），用于解决现实规模的动态任务分配问题（DTAP），通过引入图结构和等效奖励函数，显著提升了任务处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL方法主要解决小规模合成问题，忽略了现实场景的复杂性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种DRL代理，包含图结构的观察与动作表示和等效于最小化任务平均周期的奖励函数。

Result: 在五个基于真实日志的DTAP实例中，该DRL代理表现优于或匹配最佳基线，且具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该DSS能够有效处理现实规模的DTAP，并在不同时间范围和实例中表现出良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: The Dynamic Task Assignment Problem (DTAP) concerns matching resources to
tasks in real time while minimizing some objectives, like resource costs or
task cycle time. In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a
case composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case,
involves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process
requests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most
research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the
challenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work
proposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS.
To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph
structure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP
and a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of
minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two
novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment
policies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP
instances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process
mining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or
outperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on
different time horizons and across instances.

Motivation: 传统福祉理论主要关注个体状态，难以解释个体牺牲对集体进步的贡献，因此需要一种适用于群体层面的福祉模型。

Method: 论文结合基本形式本体论（BFO），提出了一种评估群体功能的模型，强调角色和持久性条件，类似于生物系统或设计人工物。

Result: 该模型实现了对群体福祉、社会制度和长期群体繁荣的结构化推理，增强了语义互操作性。

Conclusion: 通过扩展CT理论和引入BFO，论文为群体福祉的本体建模提供了新方法，适用于纵向社会贡献的分析。

Abstract: This paper explores the ontological space of group well being, proposing a
framework for representing collective welfare, group functions, and long term
contributions within an ontology engineering context. Traditional well being
theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire
satisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for
cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a
critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper
refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which
evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being
with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this
framework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends
on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather
than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the
paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of
group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions
akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables
semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions,
allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and
group flourishing over time.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that
aims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of

global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical
bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem

Motivation: 预训练视觉Transformer虽然性能优异，但计算和内存成本高昂，量化后仍因反量化操作带来显著计算开销。

Method: 通过分析计算图，提出基于操作重排序的整数化过程，延迟反量化至矩阵运算后，直接处理量化输入。

Result: 实验表明，低比特推理降低了线性层和矩阵乘法的每处理单元功耗，缩小了量化模型与高效推理间的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整数化过程显著降低了计算开销，为高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across
various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs.
While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these
models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization
before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and
propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically,
the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables
integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the
quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention
module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show
that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer
and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and
efficient inference.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗样本攻击，现有评估方法存在依赖攻击算法、耗时或难以实现的缺点。

Result: RDI与攻击成功率（ASR）相关性更强，计算时间仅为基于PGD攻击方法的1/30。

Conclusion: RDI是一种高效且攻击独立的对抗鲁棒性评估方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples,
raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently,
methods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into
attack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not
only relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming,
while the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to
implement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness
based on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation
accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial
robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based
on sample clustering features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation
by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors
separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is
attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show
that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard
adversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average
computation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD
attack. Our open-source code is available at:

Result: 在摩洛哥野火数据集上表现出更高的预测准确性和鲁棒性，且冻结的Transformer层对表征学习有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 通过模块化重用预训练Transformer的中间层，可以实现更高效和可解释的环境应用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially large Transformers, carry substantial
"memory" in their intermediate layers -- an \emph{internal world} that encodes
a wealth of relational and contextual knowledge. This work harnesses that
internal world for wildfire occurrence prediction by introducing a modular
architecture built upon Gemma 3, a state-of-the-art multimodal model. Rather
than relying on Gemma 3's original embedding and positional encoding stacks, we
develop a custom feed-forward module that transforms tabular wildfire features
into the hidden dimension required by Gemma 3's mid-layer Transformer blocks.
We freeze these Gemma 3 sub-layers -- thus preserving their pretrained
representation power -- while training only the smaller input and output
networks. This approach minimizes the number of trainable parameters and
reduces the risk of overfitting on limited wildfire data, yet retains the
benefits of Gemma 3's broad knowledge. Evaluations on a Moroccan wildfire
dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to
standard feed-forward and convolutional baselines. Ablation studies confirm
that the frozen Transformer layers consistently contribute to better
representations, underscoring the feasibility of reusing large-model mid-layers
as a learned internal world. Our findings suggest that strategic modular reuse
of pretrained Transformers can enable more data-efficient and interpretable
solutions for critical environmental applications such as wildfire risk
management.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer和SSM语言模型中的上下文检索机制，发现两者均采用Gather-and-Aggregate（G&A）机制，且集中在少数关键头部。禁用这些头部会显著降低模型性能，表明上下文检索可能掩盖任务的有限知识需求。SSM在实现G&A时存在挑战，但差距仅限于少数头部，而非整个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer和SSM语言模型在上下文检索中的表现差异，探索其背后的机制。

Method: 通过分析Gather-and-Aggregate（G&A）机制在两种模型中的实现，比较其性能差异。

Result: 发现G&A机制集中在少数头部，禁用这些头部会显著降低模型性能。SSM在实现G&A时存在挑战，但差距仅限于少数头部。

Conclusion: G&A机制是性能差异的关键，改进SSM的G&A实现可以提升其性能，同时为结合两种模型的优势提供了方向。

Abstract: SSMs offer efficient processing of long sequences with fixed state sizes, but
struggle with algorithmic tasks like retrieving past context. In this work, we
examine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and
SSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same
fundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first
identifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an
Aggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model
types, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks
even for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example,
disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades
its ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy
from 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure
the limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance
with retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar
G&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the
significance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs
manifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns
rather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus,
while a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context
retrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight
suggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers
and SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example,
in pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of
Aggregate Heads. Similarly, in a pretrained pure SSM, replacing a single G&A
head with an attention-based variant significantly improves retrieval.

  Objective: This study develops machine learning models to predict ED waiting
room occupancy at two time scales. The hourly model forecasts the waiting count
six hours ahead (e.g., a 1 PM prediction for 7 PM), while the daily model
estimates the average waiting count for the next 24 hours (e.g., a 5 PM
prediction for the following day's average). These tools support staffing
decisions and enable earlier interventions to reduce overcrowding.
  Methods: Data from a partner hospital's ED in the southeastern United States
were used, integrating internal metrics and external features. Eleven machine
learning algorithms, including traditional and deep learning models, were
trained and evaluated. Feature combinations were optimized, and performance was
assessed across varying patient volumes and hours.
  Results: TSiTPlus achieved the best hourly prediction (MAE: 4.19, MSE:
29.32). The mean hourly waiting count was 18.11, with a standard deviation of
9.77. Accuracy varied by hour, with MAEs ranging from 2.45 (11 PM) to 5.45 (8
PM). Extreme case analysis at one, two, and three standard deviations above the
mean showed MAEs of 6.16, 10.16, and 15.59, respectively. For daily
predictions, XCMPlus performed best (MAE: 2.00, MSE: 6.64), with a daily mean
of 18.11 and standard deviation of 4.51.
  Conclusions: These models accurately forecast ED waiting room occupancy and
support proactive resource allocation. Their implementation has the potential
to improve patient flow and reduce overcrowding in emergency care settings.

*Feng Chen,Yefei He,Lequan Lin,Jing Liu,Bohan Zhuang,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZipR1是一种基于强化学习的后训练方法，通过优化推理效率与性能的权衡，显著减少MLLMs的token数量，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏注意力机制虽能降低计算开销，但如何主动促进token稀疏性以提升推理加速效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ZipR1方法，将token减少比例作为效率奖励，答案准确性作为性能奖励，联合优化计算与内存瓶颈。

Result: ZipR1将Qwen2/2.5-VL的token比例从80%降至25%，在13个图像和视频基准测试中仅轻微降低准确性。

Conclusion: ZipR1有效解决了推理效率与性能的权衡问题，为MLLMs的加速提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead by
selectively processing a subset of salient tokens while preserving model
performance. Despite the effectiveness of such designs, how to actively
encourage token sparsity of well-posed MLLMs remains under-explored, which
fundamentally limits the achievable acceleration effect during inference. In
this paper, we propose a simple RL-based post-training method named
\textbf{ZipR1} that treats the token reduction ratio as the efficiency reward
and answer accuracy as the performance reward.
  In this way, our method can jointly alleviate the computation and memory
bottlenecks via directly optimizing the inference-consistent
efficiency-performance tradeoff. Experimental results demonstrate that ZipR1
can reduce the token ratio of Qwen2/2.5-VL from 80\% to 25\% with a minimal
accuracy reduction on 13 image and video benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于性能指标的加权平均方法（MWA），用于在参数高效微调（PEFT）中合并模型检查点，通过加权参数提升模型性能。实验表明，MWA优于均匀平均方法，并能超越单个检查点的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在参数高效微调（PEFT）中合并模型检查点的技术，以减少大型语言模型的训练时间并提升性能。

Method: 提出Metrics-Weighted Averaging（MWA），根据性能指标（如训练损失或训练步数）加权合并检查点，引入惩罚因子调整权重分布。

Result: 在数学推理、偏好对齐和通用指令调优任务中，MWA生成的合并模型优于均匀平均方法，损失加权合并效果最佳，任务准确率提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 验证了检查点合并对PEFT的有效性，表明基于指标的加权启发式方法能以最小计算开销显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Checkpoint merging is a technique for combining multiple model snapshots into
a single superior model, potentially reducing training time for large language
models. This paper explores checkpoint merging in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), where only small adapter modules (e.g.
LoRA) are trained. We propose Metrics-Weighted Averaging (MWA), a simple yet
effective method to merge model checkpoints by weighting their parameters
according to performance metrics. In particular, we investigate weighting by
training loss and by training steps, under the intuition that lower-loss or
later-step checkpoints are more valuable. We introduce a formula with a penalty
factor to adjust weight distribution, requiring only one hyperparameter
regardless of the number of checkpoints. Experiments on three fine-tuning tasks
(mathematical reasoning, preference alignment, and general instruction tuning)
show that MWA consistently produces merged models that outperform the naive
uniform average of checkpoints. Notably, loss-weighted merging often yields the
best results, delivering up to 5% higher task accuracy than the baseline
uniform merge and even surpassing the final individual checkpoint's
performance. These findings validate checkpoint merging for PEFT and
demonstrate that a metric-driven weighting heuristic can efficiently boost
model performance with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的自回归特性限制了推理速度，现有推测解码方法因草稿阶段开销和训练成本而效率受限。

Method: PARD采用并行草稿模型和条件丢弃令牌方法，单次前向传递预测多个令牌，降低训练成本。

Result: PARD将LLaMA3.1-8B推理速度提升4.08倍，达到每秒311.5令牌，训练效率提高3倍。

Conclusion: PARD通过并行化和低成本适应，显著提升了LLM的推理效率和适应性。

Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference
speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often
bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue
using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the
overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft
model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this
work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method
that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel
draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future
tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a
conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence
property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of
different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop
token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our
optimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x,
achieving 311.5 tokens per second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型（如OpenAI的O1、O3和DeepSeek的R1）在数学、编码等领域展现出强大的推理能力，但现有方法（如PPO和GRPO）依赖复杂的权重和启发式剪枝。本文旨在提出一种更简单、更原则性的离策略策略梯度方法，以提升LLM推理的效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: EM Policy Gradient是一种高效、简洁的离策略强化学习方法，能够显著提升LLM的推理能力和可解释性，同时具备实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, foundation models such as OpenAI's O1 and O3, along with DeepSeek's
R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capacities and problem-solving skills
acquired through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), with wide
applications in mathematics, coding, science, intelligent agents, and virtual
assistants. In this work, we introduce an off-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm, EM Policy Gradient, aimed at enhancing LLM reasoning by optimizing
expected return over reasoning trajectories. We frame the reasoning task as an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization problem, alternating between
sampling diverse rationale trajectories and performing reward-guided
fine-tuning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, which rely on complex importance weights and
heuristic clipping, our method provides a simpler, more principled off-policy
policy gradient approach, eliminating these complexities while maintaining
strong performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of EM Policy Gradient on the
GSM8K and MATH (HARD) datasets, where it achieves performance comparable to or
slightly surpassing the state-of-the-art GRPO, while offering additional
advantages in scalability, simplicity, and reasoning conciseness. Moreover,
models fine-tuned with our method exhibit cognitive behaviors, such as
sub-problem decomposition, self-verification, and backtracking, highlighting
its potential to enhance both the interpretability and robustness of LLM
reasoning.

Method: 采用非负雪花张量分解模型，设计雪花核心张量增强学习能力，并使用SLF-NMUT方法进行参数学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能更准确地学习动态用户-服务交互模式，从而提升缺失QoS数据的预测效果。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在动态QoS数据预测中表现优异，为理解用户行为和服务条件提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Dynamic quality of service (QoS) data exhibit rich temporal patterns in
user-service interactions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding
of user behavior and service conditions in Web service. As the number of users
and services increases, there is a large amount of unobserved QoS data, which
significantly affects users'choice of services. To predict unobserved QoS data,
we propose a Non-negative Snowflake Factorization of tensors model. This method
designs a snowflake core tensor to enhance the model's learning capability.
Additionally, it employs a single latent factor-based, nonnegative
multiplication update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) for parameter learning. Empirical
results demonstrate that the proposed model more accurately learns dynamic
user-service interaction patterns, thereby yielding improved predictions for
missing QoS data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful,
discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate
solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries.
Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder
methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with
non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant
Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into
latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and
capture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with
global parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus
efficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging
the inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is
able to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape
variations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive
experiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material
benchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
graph based, operator learning, and neural field methods. Notably, our method
supports real time inference and zero-shot super-resolution, enabling efficient
training on low-resolution meshes while maintaining high accuracy on full-scale

Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant global
health burden, where precise severity assessment is particularly critical for
effective clinical management in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. This study
introduces an innovative machine learning framework for COPD severity

unlabeled data and enhance model performance. The random forest classifier
emerged as particularly effective, demonstrating exceptional discriminative
capability with 92.51% accuracy and 0.98 ROC AUC in differentiating between
mild-to-moderate and severe COPD cases. This machine learning approach provides
clinicians with a practical, accurate, and efficient tool for rapid COPD
severity evaluation in ICU environments, with significant potential to improve
both clinical decision-making processes and patient outcomes. Future research

Conclusion: MCD通过减少扰动共适应性，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性，尤其在计算资源增加时表现更优。

Abstract: We study the problem of transfer-based black-box attack, where adversarial
samples generated using a single surrogate model are directly applied to target
models. Compared with untargeted attacks, existing methods still have lower
Attack Success Rates (ASRs) in the targeted setting, i.e., the obtained
adversarial examples often overfit the surrogate model but fail to mislead
other models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the pixels or features in
these adversarial examples collaborate in a highly dependent manner to maximize
the success of an adversarial attack on the surrogate model, which we refer to
as perturbation co-adaptation. Then, we propose to Mitigate perturbation
Co-adaptation by DropConnect (MCD) to enhance transferability, by creating
diverse variants of surrogate model at each optimization iteration. We conduct
extensive experiments across various CNN- and Transformer-based models to
demonstrate the effectiveness of MCD. In the challenging scenario of
transferring from a CNN-based model to Transformer-based models, MCD achieves
13% higher average ASRs compared with state-of-the-art baselines. MCD boosts
the performance of self-ensemble methods by bringing in more diversification
across the variants while reserving sufficient semantic information for each
variant. In addition, MCD attains the highest performance gain when scaling the
compute of crafting adversarial examples.

Abstract: Environmental biotechnologies, such as drinking water biofilters, rely on
complex interactions between microbial communities and their surrounding
physical-chemical environments. Predicting the performance of these systems is
challenging due to high-dimensional, sparse datasets that lack diversity and
fail to fully capture system behaviour. Accurate predictive models require
innovative, science-guided approaches. In this study, we present the first
application of Buckingham Pi theory to modelling biofilter performance. This
dimensionality reduction technique identifies meaningful, dimensionless
variables that enhance predictive accuracy and improve model interpretability.
Using these variables, we developed the Environmental Buckingham Pi Neural
Network (EnviroPiNet), a physics-guided model benchmarked against traditional
data-driven methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
autoencoder neural networks. Our findings demonstrate that the EnviroPiNet
model achieves an R^2 value of 0.9236 on the testing dataset, significantly
outperforming PCA and autoencoder methods. The Buckingham Pi variables also
provide insights into the physical and chemical relationships governing
biofilter behaviour, with implications for system design and optimization. This
study highlights the potential of combining physical principles with AI
approaches to model complex environmental systems characterized by sparse,
high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data
changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data
becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling
for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by
how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model
of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance
is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies
in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from
training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming
data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential
learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique
benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid
framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly
identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates
frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work
with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an
application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly
detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each
dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection
techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and
Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and
computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing
hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.

Motivation: Xeno-Canto鸟类音频库中的标签噪声问题（如非目标鸟类声音的干扰）影响了机器学习模型的分类准确性，因此需要一种有效的清理方法。

Method: 采用音频预处理、降维（包括两种卷积自编码器和变分深度嵌入VaDE）和无监督异常检测（UOD）来识别和清理标签噪声。

Result: 不同降维方法对标签噪声的清理效果因物种而异，但整体上能有效减少噪声。

Conclusion: 提出的清理流程能显著减少Xeno-Canto数据集中的标签噪声，但效果因物种不同而有所差异。

Abstract: The Xeno-Canto bird audio repository is an invaluable resource for those
interested in vocalizations and other sounds made by birds around the world.
This is particularly the case for machine learning researchers attempting to
improve on the bird species recognition accuracy of classification models.
However, the task of extracting labeled datasets from the recordings found in
this crowd-sourced repository faces several challenges. One challenge of
particular significance to machine learning practitioners is that one bird
species label is applied to each audio recording, but frequently other sounds
are also captured including other bird species, other animal sounds,
anthropogenic and other ambient sounds. These non-target bird species sounds
can result in dataset labeling discrepancies referred to as label noise. In
this work we present a cleaning process consisting of audio preprocessing
followed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised outlier detection (UOD)
to reduce the label noise in a dataset derived from Xeno-Canto recordings. We
investigate three neural network dimensionality reduction techniques: two
flavors of convolutional autoencoders and variational deep embedding (VaDE
(Jiang, 2017)). While both methods show some degree of effectiveness at
detecting outliers for most bird species datasets, we found significant
variation in the performance of the methods from one species to the next. We
believe that the results of this investigation demonstrate that the application
of our cleaning process can meaningfully reduce the label noise of bird species
datasets derived from Xeno-Canto audio repository but results vary across
species.

Motivation: ICESat-2数据的高分辨率测量需要大量人工标注，且与背景图像的匹配率低，限制了监督学习的效率。

Method: 基于LSTM和CNN的自编码器用于重建地形序列并生成嵌入，随后使用UMAP降维和可视化。

Result: 自编码器生成的嵌入保留了数据整体结构，且聚类更紧凑，表明可以减少所需标注样本数量。

Conclusion: 无监督自编码器在减少ICESat-2数据标注需求方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides high-resolution
measurements of sea ice height. Recent studies have developed machine learning
methods on ICESat-2 data, primarily focusing on surface type classification.
However, the heavy reliance on manually collected labels requires significant
time and effort for supervised learning, as it involves cross-referencing track
measurements with overlapping background optical imagery. Additionally, the
coincidence of ICESat-2 tracks with background images is relatively rare due to
the different overpass patterns and atmospheric conditions. To address these
limitations, this study explores the potential of unsupervised autoencoder on
unlabeled data to derive latent embeddings. We develop autoencoder models based
on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to
reconstruct topographic sequences from ICESat-2 and derive embeddings. We then
apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce dimensions
and visualize the embeddings. Our results show that embeddings from
autoencoders preserve the overall structure but generate relatively more
compact clusters compared to the original ICESat-2 data, indicating the
potential of embeddings to lessen the number of required labels samples.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂多模态分布提供了一种可靠的密度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in
statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best
modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal
patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms
often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying
distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of
histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as
gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant
analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for
multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes
minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach
builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic
decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean
classification dataset.

Result: 原型网络在所有实验中（每类少于20个样本时）表现优于GCN；放松假设后，GCN性能下降更显著。

Conclusion: 原型网络在少量标记数据下更具鲁棒性，适用于实际场景中的图分类任务。

Abstract: Despite the ample availability of graph data, obtaining vertex labels is a
tedious and expensive task. Therefore, it is desirable to learn from a few
labeled vertices only. Existing few-shot learners assume a class oracle, which
provides labeled vertices for a desired class. However, such an oracle is not
available in a real-world setting, i.e., when drawing a vertex for labeling it
is unknown to which class the vertex belongs. Few-shot learners are often
combined with prototypical networks, while classical semi-supervised vertex
classification uses discriminative models, e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN). In this paper, we train our models by iteratively prompting a human
annotator with vertices to annotate. We perform three experiments where we
continually relax our assumptions. First, we assume a class oracle, i.e., the
human annotator is provided with an equal number of vertices to label for each
class. We denote this as "Balanced Sampling''. In the subsequent experiment,
"Unbalanced Sampling,'' we replace the class oracle with $k$-medoids clustering
and draw vertices to label from the clusters. In the last experiment, the
"Unknown Number of Classes,'' we no longer assumed we knew the number and
distribution of classes. Our results show that prototypical models outperform
discriminative models in all experiments when fewer than $20$ samples per class
are available. While dropping the assumption of the class oracle for the
"Unbalanced Sampling'' experiment reduces the performance of the GCN by $9\%$,
the prototypical network loses only $1\%$ on average. For the "Unknown Number
of Classes'' experiment, the average performance for both models decreased
further by $1\%$.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed weather forecasting by improving both its
accuracy and computational efficiency. However, before any forecast can begin,
weather centers must identify the current atmospheric state from vast amounts
of observational data. To address this challenging problem, we introduce Appa,
a score-based data assimilation model producing global atmospheric trajectories
at 0.25-degree resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 1.5B-parameter
spatio-temporal latent diffusion model trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, Appa
can be conditioned on any type of observations to infer the posterior
distribution of plausible state trajectories, without retraining. Our unified
probabilistic framework flexibly tackles multiple inference tasks --
reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting -- using the same model, eliminating the
need for task-specific architectures or training procedures. Experiments
demonstrate physical consistency on a global scale and good reconstructions
from observations, while showing competitive forecasting skills. Our results
establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for
future global atmospheric modeling systems.

Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法（如LoRA和Adapter）在参数效率和计算开销方面仍有改进空间，TLoRA旨在提供更高效的替代方案。

Method: TLoRA将权重更新分解为三个矩阵（两个固定随机矩阵和一个可训练矩阵），并引入可学习的层间缩放因子。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，TLoRA性能与现有方法相当，但所需可训练参数显著减少。其权重分布呈现高斯特性，参数范数稳定，缩放因子具有层间变异性。

Conclusion: TLoRA是一种高效且有效的LLM微调方法，为资源高效的模型适应提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We propose TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method that
decomposes weight updates into three matrices: two fixed random matrices and
one trainable matrix, combined with a learnable, layer-wise scaling factor.
This tri-matrix design enables TLoRA to achieve highly efficient parameter
adaptation while introducing minimal additional computational overhead. Through
extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate that TLoRA achieves
comparable performance to existing low-rank methods such as LoRA and
Adapter-based techniques, while requiring significantly fewer trainable
parameters. Analyzing the adaptation dynamics, we observe that TLoRA exhibits
Gaussian-like weight distributions, stable parameter norms, and scaling factor
variability across layers, further highlighting its expressive power and
adaptability. Additionally, we show that TLoRA closely resembles LoRA in its
eigenvalue distributions, parameter norms, and cosine similarity of updates,
underscoring its ability to effectively approximate LoRA's adaptation behavior.
Our results establish TLoRA as a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning
method for LLMs, offering a significant step forward in resource-efficient

Motivation: 研究异步Q学习算法的收敛性，特别是自适应步长对收敛的影响，填补了该领域的空白。

Method: 采用自适应步长作为局部时钟，结合中心化步骤，通过非马尔可夫随机逼近（SA）方案分析收敛性。

Result: 算法以$O(1/k)$的速率收敛到最优相对Q函数，并证明了自适应步长的必要性。

Conclusion: 自适应步长是关键，且提出的分析工具可广泛应用于其他自适应步长的SA算法。

Abstract: This work presents the first finite-time analysis for the last-iterate
convergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. A
key feature of the algorithm we study is the use of adaptive stepsizes, which
serve as local clocks for each state-action pair. We show that the iterates
generated by this Q-learning algorithm converge at a rate of $O(1/k)$ (in the
mean-square sense) to the optimal relative Q-function in the span seminorm.
Moreover, by adding a centering step to the algorithm, we further establish
pointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function,
also at a rate of $O(1/k)$. To prove these results, we show that adaptive
stepsizes are necessary, as without them, the algorithm fails to converge to
the correct target. In addition, adaptive stepsizes can be interpreted as a
form of implicit importance sampling that counteracts the effects of
asynchronous updates.
  Technically, the use of adaptive stepsizes makes each Q-learning update
depend on the entire sample history, introducing strong correlations and making
the algorithm a non-Markovian stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. Our
approach to overcoming this challenge involves (1) a time-inhomogeneous
Markovian reformulation of non-Markovian SA, and (2) a combination of
almost-sure time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain
concentration inequalities to break the strong correlations between the
adaptive stepsizes and the iterates. The tools developed in this work are
likely to be broadly applicable to the analysis of general SA algorithms with
adaptive stepsizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图神经网络（DGNN）主要依赖节点对交互，忽略了共同邻居的作用，限制了链接预测的性能。

Method: 通过多跳共同邻居估计相关性分数，并将其融入消息传递过程，直接考虑共同邻居的交互。

Result: 在三个真实动态图上的实验表明，HGNN-CNA在链接预测任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HGNN-CNA通过引入共同邻居的高阶交互，有效提升了动态图链接预测的准确性。

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in dynamic graph learning (DGL),
inherently shaped by the topology of the DG. Recent advancements in dynamic
graph neural networks (DGNN), primarily by modeling the relationships among
nodes via a message passing scheme, have significantly improved link prediction
performance. However, DGNNs heavily rely on the pairwise node interactions,
which neglect the common neighbor interaction in DGL. To address this
limitation, we propose a High-order Graph Neural Networks with Common Neighbor
Awareness (HGNN-CNA) for link prediction with two-fold ideas: a) estimating
correlation score by considering multi-hop common neighbors for capturing the
complex interaction between nodes; b) fusing the correlation into the
message-passing process to consider common neighbor interaction directly in
DGL. Experimental results on three real DGs demonstrate that the proposed
HGNN-CNA acquires a significant accuracy gain over several state-of-the-art
models on the link prediction task.

Motivation: 强化学习（RL）在早期训练中样本效率低下，现有方法通常引入复杂架构和先验知识，增加了实现难度。

Method: DAI通过时间变化权重α(t)插值专家和RL动作，可直接集成到任何Actor-Critic算法中，无需额外网络或损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，DAI在MuJoCo连续控制任务中早期性能提升160%，最终性能提升50%，Humanoid任务早期性能提升4倍，收敛时提升2倍。

Conclusion: DAI证明了简单框架也能显著提升样本效率，挑战了复杂架构修改的必要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from severe sample inefficiency,
especially during early training, requiring extensive environmental
interactions to perform competently. Existing methods tend to solve this by
incorporating prior knowledge, but introduce significant architectural and
implementation complexity. We propose Dynamic Action Interpolation (DAI), a
universal yet straightforward framework that interpolates expert and RL actions
via a time-varying weight $\alpha(t)$, integrating into any Actor-Critic
algorithm with just a few lines of code and without auxiliary networks or
additional losses. Our theoretical analysis shows that DAI reshapes state
visitation distributions to accelerate value function learning while preserving
convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations across MuJoCo continuous control
tasks demonstrate that DAI improves early-stage performance by over 160\% on
average and final performance by more than 50\%, with the Humanoid task showing
a 4$\times$ improvement early on and a 2$\times$ gain at convergence. These
results challenge the assumption that complex architectural modifications are
necessary for sample-efficient reinforcement learning.

Result: 实验表明FIT在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，视觉特征图和频率误差图验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FIT通过频率信息的整合与利用显著提升了超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Methods based on implicit neural representation have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) tasks, but they neglect
the potential value of the frequency domain, leading to sub-optimal
performance. We proposes a novel network called Frequency-Integrated
Transformer (FIT) to incorporate and utilize frequency information to enhance
ASSR performance. FIT employs Frequency Incorporation Module (FIM) to introduce
frequency information in a lossless manner and Frequency Utilization
Self-Attention module (FUSAM) to efficiently leverage frequency information by
exploiting spatial-frequency interrelationship and global nature of frequency.
FIM enriches detail characterization by incorporating frequency information
through a combination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with real-imaginary
mapping. In FUSAM, Interaction Implicit Self-Attention (IISA) achieves
cross-domain information synergy by interacting spatial and frequency
information in subspace, while Frequency Correlation Self-attention (FCSA)
captures the global context by computing correlation in frequency. Experimental
results demonstrate FIT yields superior performance compared to existing
methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Visual feature map proves the
superiority of FIM in enriching detail characterization. Frequency error map
validates IISA productively improve the frequency fidelity. Local attribution
map validates FCSA effectively captures global context.

Conclusion: 该方法成功保留了趋势和季节性信息，同时在非平稳数据上实现了竞争性的预测性能。

Abstract: AI models have garnered significant research attention towards predictive
task automation. However, a stationary training environment is an underlying
assumption for most models and such models simply do not work on non-stationary
data since a stationary relationship is learned. The existing solutions propose
making data stationary prior to model training and evaluation. This leads to
loss of trend and seasonal patterns which are vital components for learning
temporal dependencies of the system under study. This research aims to address
this limitation by proposing a method for enforcing stationary behaviour within
the latent space while preserving trend and seasonal information. The method
deploys techniques including Differencing, Time-series decomposition, and
Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA), to learn information vital for efficient
approximation of trend and seasonal information which is then stored as
embeddings within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The
approach's ability to preserve trend and seasonal information was evaluated on
two time-series non-stationary datasets. For predictive performance evaluation,
four deep learning models were trained on the latent vector representations of
the datasets after application of the proposed method and all models produced
competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques using RMSE
as the performance metric.

Conclusion: INN框架为系统辨识提供了有效的不确定性量化方法，提升了模型的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: System Identification (SysID) is crucial for modeling and understanding
dynamical systems using experimental data. While traditional SysID methods
emphasize linear models, their inability to fully capture nonlinear dynamics
has driven the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) as a more powerful alternative.
However, the lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in DL-based models poses
challenges for reliability and safety, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating UQ. This paper introduces a systematic framework for constructing
and learning Interval Neural Networks (INNs) to perform UQ in SysID tasks. INNs
are derived by transforming the learnable parameters (LPs) of pre-trained
neural networks into interval-valued LPs without relying on probabilistic
assumptions. By employing interval arithmetic throughout the network, INNs can
generate Prediction Intervals (PIs) that capture target coverage effectively.
We extend Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs) into Interval LSTM (ILSTM) and Interval NODE (INODE)
architectures, providing the mathematical foundations for their application in
SysID. To train INNs, we propose a DL framework that integrates a UQ loss
function and parameterization tricks to handle constraints arising from
interval LPs. We introduce novel concept "elasticity" for underlying
uncertainty causes and validate ILSTM and INODE in SysID experiments,
demonstrating their effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法在高维噪声环境中存在振荡和收敛慢的问题，TFGD旨在通过分数阶系数和指数衰减机制解决这些问题。

Method: TFGD结合分数阶系数$|w_j| = \binom{\alpha}{j}$和指数衰减参数$\lambda$，形成调制的记忆机制，保持与SGD相同的时间复杂度。

Result: 理论分析显示TFGD在凸设置下收敛速度为$\mathcal{O}(1/K)$，随机变体误差衰减为$\mathcal{O}(1/k^\alpha)$。实验在乳腺癌数据集上达到98.25%准确率，收敛速度是SGD的2倍。

Conclusion: TFGD在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，特别是在医学分类任务中，是传统优化器的有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent (TFGD), a novel
optimization framework that synergizes fractional calculus with exponential
tempering to enhance gradient-based learning. Traditional gradient descent
methods often suffer from oscillatory updates and slow convergence in
high-dimensional, noisy landscapes. TFGD addresses these limitations by
incorporating a tempered memory mechanism, where historical gradients are
weighted by fractional coefficients $|w_j| = \binom{\alpha}{j}$ and
exponentially decayed via a tempering parameter $\lambda$. Theoretical analysis
establishes TFGD's convergence guarantees: in convex settings, it achieves an
$\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ rate with alignment coefficient $d_{\alpha,\lambda} = (1 -
e^{-\lambda})^{-\alpha}$, while stochastic variants attain
$\mathcal{O}(1/k^\alpha)$ error decay. The algorithm maintains $\mathcal{O}(n)$
time complexity equivalent to SGD, with memory overhead scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(d/\lambda)$ for parameter dimension $d$. Empirical validation on
the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset demonstrates TFGD's superiority, achieving
98.25\% test accuracy (vs. 92.11\% for SGD) and 2$\times$ faster convergence.
The tempered memory mechanism proves particularly effective in medical
classification tasks, where feature correlations benefit from stable gradient
averaging. These results position TFGD as a robust alternative to conventional
optimizers in both theoretical and applied machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce a temporal feature encoding architecture called Time Series
Representation Model (TSRM) for multivariate time series forecasting and
imputation. The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation
layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and
designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based
feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted
features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is
inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core.
The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the
seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for
both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly
reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is

Conclusion: TSCAN通过两阶段训练和上下文感知机制，显著提升了提升模型的性能，并在实际场景中验证了其效果。

Abstract: A primary challenge in ITE estimation is sample selection bias. Traditional
approaches utilize treatment regularization techniques such as the Integral
Probability Metrics (IPM), re-weighting, and propensity score modeling to
mitigate this bias. However, these regularizations may introduce undesirable
information loss and limit the performance of the model. Furthermore, treatment
effects vary across different external contexts, and the existing methods are
insufficient in fully interacting with and utilizing these contextual features.
To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware uplift model based on the
Two-Stage training approach (TSCAN), comprising CAN-U and CAN-D sub-models. In
the first stage, we train an uplift model, called CAN-U, which includes the
treatment regularizations of IPM and propensity score prediction, to generate a
complete dataset with counterfactual uplift labels. In the second stage, we
train a model named CAN-D, which utilizes an isotonic output layer to directly
model uplift effects, thereby eliminating the reliance on the regularization
components. CAN-D adaptively corrects the errors estimated by CAN-U through
reinforcing the factual samples, while avoiding the negative impacts associated
with the aforementioned regularizations. Additionally, we introduce a
Context-Aware Attention Layer throughout the two-stage process to manage the
interactions between treatment, merchant, and contextual features, thereby
modeling the varying treatment effect in different contexts. We conduct
extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness
of TSCAN. Ultimately, the deployment of our model for real-world merchant
diagnosis on one of China's largest online food ordering platforms validates
its practical utility and impact.

Abstract: Neuroimaging provides a critical framework for characterizing brain activity
by quantifying connectivity patterns and functional architecture across
modalities. While modern machine learning has significantly advanced our
understanding of neural processing mechanisms through these datasets, decoding
task-specific signatures must contend with inherent neuroimaging constraints,
for example, low signal-to-noise ratios in raw electrophysiological recordings,
cross-session non-stationarity, and limited sample sizes. This review focuses
on machine learning approaches for covariance-based neuroimaging data, where
often symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices under full-rank conditions
encode inter-channel relationships. By equipping the space of SPD matrices with
Riemannian metrics (e.g., affine-invariant or log-Euclidean), their space forms
a Riemannian manifold enabling geometric analysis. We unify methodologies
operating on this manifold under the SPD learning framework, which
systematically leverages the SPD manifold's geometry to process covariance
features, thereby advancing brain imaging analytics.

<details>

Motivation: 传统因子分析（FA）无法处理结构化数据模态（如文本或单细胞测序数据），因此需要一种新方法来整合这些数据并揭示共享的、可解释的变异轴。

Method: FACTM结合因子分析和相关主题建模，采用变分推断优化，并引入旋转潜在因子的方法以增强可解释性。

Conclusion: FACTM是一种有效的工具，能够整合结构化数据并推断共享的、可解释的因子，适用于多模态数据分析。

Abstract: Integrating various data modalities brings valuable insights into underlying
phenomena. Multimodal factor analysis (FA) uncovers shared axes of variation
underlying different simple data modalities, where each sample is represented
by a vector of features. However, FA is not suited for structured data
modalities, such as text or single cell sequencing data, where multiple data
points are measured per each sample and exhibit a clustering structure. To
overcome this challenge, we introduce FACTM, a novel, multi-view and
multi-structure Bayesian model that combines FA with correlated topic modeling
and is optimized using variational inference. Additionally, we introduce a
method for rotating latent factors to enhance interpretability with respect to
binary features. On text and video benchmarks as well as real-world music and
COVID-19 datasets, we demonstrate that FACTM outperforms other methods in
identifying clusters in structured data, and integrating them with simple
modalities via the inference of shared, interpretable factors.

### [138] [Revisiting Transformers through the Lens of Low Entropy and Dynamic Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18929)
*Ruifeng Ren,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers在数据压缩中表现出独特的归纳偏置，倾向于学习低熵分布，且模型规模越大越明显。FFN模块驱动这一偏置，同时模型参数中存在冗余，表现为动态稀疏性。大模型更倾向于绕过注意力计算，且训练不稳定与死神经元增加相关。


<details>

Motivation: 研究Transformers在压缩任务中的表现，特别是其与目标分布的对齐程度及信息压缩的机制，以解决目标分布未知和熵计算成本高的问题。

Method: 在受控实验设置下，分析Transformers的压缩行为，重点关注其对低熵分布的偏好、FFN模块的作用及动态稀疏性。

Result: Transformers倾向于学习更低熵的分布，FFN模块是关键驱动因素；模型参数冗余表现为动态稀疏性，大模型更倾向于绕过注意力计算；训练不稳定与死神经元增加相关。

Conclusion: 研究从熵和动态稀疏性角度深化了对Transformers的理解，揭示了其压缩行为的独特偏置及内部机制。

Abstract: Compression has been a critical lens to understand the success of
Transformers. In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a
criterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often
remains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression
and to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of
the target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is
typically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In
this work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We
find that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:
beyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning
lower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the
model size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly
aligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its
information content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical
role in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational
redundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within
their parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through
dynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers,
particularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for
this, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing
attention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of
active neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger
models strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work
contributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy
and dynamic sparsity.

Conclusion: 非学习型迭代优化器与机器学习模型一样对对抗样本敏感，但可以通过对抗训练增强其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often sensitive to carefully crafted yet
seemingly unnoticeable perturbations. Such adversarial examples are considered
to be a property of ML models, often associated with their black-box operation
and sensitivity to features learned from data. This work examines the
adversarial sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, and particularly of
iterative optimizers. Our analysis is inspired by the recent developments in
deep unfolding, which cast such optimizers as ML models. We show that
non-learned iterative optimizers share the sensitivity to adversarial examples
of ML models, and that attacking iterative optimizers effectively alters the
optimization objective surface in a manner that modifies the minima sought. We
then leverage the ability to cast iteration-limited optimizers as ML models to
enhance robustness via adversarial training. For a class of proximal gradient
optimizers, we rigorously prove how their learning affects adversarial
sensitivity. We numerically back our findings, showing the vulnerability of
various optimizers, as well as the robustness induced by unfolding and
adversarial training.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial
and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We
propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a
Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across
subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of
neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct
a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains.
Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be
seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer
that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local
uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can
be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding
uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for
different domain sizes.

Conclusion: 尽管新算法未证明为最优，但其在计算效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于ASHT问题的实际应用。

Abstract: We study the Active Simple Hypothesis Testing (ASHT) problem, a simpler
variant of the Fixed Budget Best Arm Identification problem. In this work, we
provide novel game theoretic formulation of the upper bounds of the ASHT
problem. This formulation allows us to leverage tools of differential games and
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to propose an approximately optimal
algorithm that is computationally tractable compared to prior work. However,
the optimal algorithm still suffers from a curse of dimensionality and instead
we use a novel link to Blackwell Approachability to propose an algorithm that
is far more efficient computationally. We show that this new algorithm,
although not proven to be optimal, is always better than static algorithms in
all instances of ASHT and is numerically observed to attain the optimal
exponent in various instances.

Motivation: 在需要梯度方法的场景中，硬舍入函数不可微分，因此需要平滑且可微的替代方案。

Method: 基于两种方法：(1) 局部化的Sigmoid窗口函数；(2) 归一化的Sigmoid导数加权和。

Result: 两种方法均能点态收敛到经典舍入函数，且在计算成本和精度间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 这些方法为硬舍入提供了完全可微的替代方案，适用于梯度优化场景。

Abstract: We propose novel smooth approximations to the classical rounding function,
suitable for differentiable optimization and machine learning applications. Our
constructions are based on two approaches: (1) localized sigmoid window
functions centered at each integer, and (2) normalized weighted sums of sigmoid
derivatives representing local densities. The first method approximates the
step-like behavior of rounding through differences of shifted sigmoids, while
the second method achieves smooth interpolation between integers via
density-based weighting. Both methods converge pointwise to the classical
rounding function as the sharpness parameter k tends to infinity, and allow
controlled trade-offs between smoothness and approximation accuracy. We
demonstrate that by restricting the summation to a small set of nearest
integers, the computational cost remains low without sacrificing precision.
These constructions provide fully differentiable alternatives to hard rounding,
which are valuable in contexts where gradient-based methods are essential.

Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative
measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary
biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive
sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to
elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each
sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in
multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing,"
i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has
established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique
solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight
space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish
the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight
space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e.
the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We
disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the
learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We
also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit
Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive
the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process
posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be
efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally,
we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most
common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends
our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.

Abstract: The growing demand for molecules with tailored properties in fields such as
drug discovery and chemical engineering has driven advancements in
computational methods for molecular design. Machine learning-based approaches
for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention.
This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined
with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with
desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular
descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes,
enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader
molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures
the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer
achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors
back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for
generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant
molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With
the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant
molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector
embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the
discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular

Abstract: We propose a novel method for density estimation that leverages an estimated

each data point is adjusted by taking a single step along the score function
with a specific choice of step size, followed by standard KDE with a modified
bandwidth. The step size and modified bandwidth are chosen to remove the
leading order bias in the KDE. Our experiments on synthetic tasks in 1D, 2D and
on MNIST, demonstrate that our proposed SD-KDE method significantly reduces the
mean integrated squared error compared to the standard Silverman KDE, even with
noisy estimates in the score function. These results underscore the potential
of integrating score-based corrections into nonparametric density estimation.

Result: 实验表明DRDFL在多种数据异构场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRDFL通过结合个性化特征和全局共享知识，实现了高效的去中心化联邦学习。

Abstract: We introduce Ring-topology Decentralized Federated Learning (RDFL) for
distributed model training, aiming to avoid the inherent risks of centralized
failure in server-based FL. However, RDFL faces the challenge of low
information-sharing efficiency due to the point-to-point communication manner
when handling inherent data heterogeneity. Existing studies to mitigate data
heterogeneity focus on personalized optimization of models, ignoring that the
lack of shared information constraints can lead to large differences among
models, weakening the benefits of collaborative learning. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Divide-and-conquer RDFL framework (DRDFL) that uses a
feature generation model to extract personalized information and invariant
shared knowledge from the underlying data distribution, ensuring both effective
personalization and strong generalization. Specifically, we design a
\textit{PersonaNet} module that encourages class-specific feature
representations to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, facilitating the
learning of discriminative latent representations tailored to local data
distributions. Meanwhile, the \textit{Learngene} module is introduced to
encapsulate shared knowledge through an adversarial classifier to align latent
representations and extract globally invariant information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRDFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
various data heterogeneity settings.

Abstract: Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential
decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional
value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta
reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which
demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the
development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where
risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work
characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a
Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and
constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we
propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity
Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential
decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of
robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot
adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning
process under certain scenarios. Our project website is at

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) excel where phase matters, yet their
multi-sheeted decision surfaces defy standard explainability and calibration
tools. We propose a \emph{Newton-Puiseux} framework that fits a local
polynomial surrogate to a high-uncertainty input and analytically decomposes
this surrogate into fractional-power series. The resulting Puiseux expansions,
dominant Puiseux coefficients, and phase-aligned curvature descriptors deliver
closed-form estimates of robustness and over-confidence that gradient - or
perturbation-based methods (saliency, LIME, SHAP) cannot provide. On a
controlled $\mathbb{C}^2$ helix the surrogate attains RMSE $< 0.09$ while
recovering the number of decision sheets; quartic coefficients predict
adversarial flip radii within $10^{-3}$. On the real-world MIT-BIH arrhythmia

*Ming Xu,Jinrong Xiang,Zilong Xie,Xiangfu Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HetGL2R是一种基于异构图学习的节点重要性排序方法，通过整合OD需求、路径选择和道路结构特征，显著提高了道路网络中关键节点的识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有节点重要性排序方法主要依赖结构和拓扑信息，忽略了OD需求和路径选择等关键因素，导致排序准确性不足。

Method: 提出HetGL2R方法，构建三部分图（trip graph）整合OD需求、路径选择和道路特征，设计嵌入方法（HetGWalk和Transformer编码器）学习节点表示，并采用列表排序策略评估节点重要性。

Conclusion: HetGL2R通过整合多源信息，为交通管理和城市规划提供了更有效的节点重要性评估工具。

Abstract: Accurately identifying critical nodes with high spatial influence in road
networks is essential for enhancing the efficiency of traffic management and
urban planning. However, existing node importance ranking methods mainly rely
on structural features and topological information, often overlooking critical
factors such as origin-destination (OD) demand and route information. This
limitation leaves considerable room for improvement in ranking accuracy. To
address this issue, we propose HetGL2R, an attributed heterogeneous graph
learning approach for ranking node importance in road networks. This method
introduces a tripartite graph (trip graph) to model the structure of the road
network, integrating OD demand, route choice, and various structural features
of road segments. Based on the trip graph, we design an embedding method to
learn node representations that reflect the spatial influence of road segments.
The method consists of a heterogeneous random walk sampling algorithm
(HetGWalk) and a Transformer encoder. HetGWalk constructs multiple
attribute-guided graphs based on the trip graph to enrich the diversity of
semantic associations between nodes. It then applies a joint random walk
mechanism to convert both topological structures and node attributes into
sequences, enabling the encoder to capture spatial dependencies more
effectively among road segments. Finally, a listwise ranking strategy is
employed to evaluate node importance. To validate the performance of our
method, we construct two synthetic datasets using SUMO based on simulated road
networks. Experimental results demonstrate that HetGL2R significantly
outperforms baselines in incorporating OD demand and route choice information,
achieving more accurate and robust node ranking. Furthermore, we conduct a case
study using real-world taxi trajectory data from Beijing, further verifying the
practicality of the proposed method.

### [154] [Convergence Properties of Natural Gradient Descent for Minimizing KL Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19259)
*Adwait Datar,Nihat Ay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在概率单纯形上最小化KL散度的问题，分析了在指数族（θ坐标）和混合族（η坐标）下梯度下降（GD）与自然梯度下降（NGD）的收敛行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL散度在概率机器学习中作为标准损失函数，但参数化选择对收敛有显著影响，因此需要研究不同坐标系统和优化算法的表现。

Method: 比较了欧几里得梯度下降（GD）在θ和η坐标下的表现，以及坐标不变的自然梯度下降（NGD），并分析了其在连续时间和离散时间下的收敛性。

Result: 在连续时间下，GD在θ和η坐标的收敛率分别为NGD的下界和上界；在离散时间下，NGD表现出更快的收敛性和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NGD在离散时间下优于GD，尽管在连续时间下其优势不明显，但其鲁棒性和收敛速度使其在实际应用中更具优势。

Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence plays a central role in probabilistic
machine learning, where it commonly serves as the canonical loss function.
Optimization in such settings is often performed over the probability simplex,
where the choice of parameterization significantly impacts convergence. In this
work, we study the problem of minimizing the KL divergence and analyze the
behavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms under two dual coordinate
systems within the framework of information geometry$-$ the exponential family
($\theta$ coordinates) and the mixture family ($\eta$ coordinates). We compare
Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in these coordinates with the
coordinate-invariant natural gradient descent (NGD), where the natural gradient
is a Riemannian gradient that incorporates the intrinsic geometry of the
parameter space. In continuous time, we prove that the convergence rates of GD
in the $\theta$ and $\eta$ coordinates provide lower and upper bounds,
respectively, on the convergence rate of NGD. Moreover, under affine
reparameterizations of the dual coordinates, the convergence rates of GD in
$\eta$ and $\theta$ coordinates can be scaled to $2c$ and $\frac{2}{c}$,
respectively, for any $c>0$, while NGD maintains a fixed convergence rate of
$2$, remaining invariant to such transformations and sandwiched between them.
Although this suggests that NGD may not exhibit uniformly superior convergence
in continuous time, we demonstrate that its advantages become pronounced in
discrete time, where it achieves faster convergence and greater robustness to
noise, outperforming GD. Our analysis hinges on bounding the spectrum and
condition number of the Hessian of the KL divergence at the optimum, which
coincides with the Fisher information matrix.

TL;DR: TeleSparse是一种ZK-SNARK友好的后处理机制，通过稀疏化和神经传送优化，显著减少了验证深度学习的计算开销，同时保持高准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证深度学习推理的完整性通常需要访问模型权重和敏感的训练数据，而ZK-SNARKs可以在不暴露这些数据的情况下实现验证，但计算开销巨大。

Method: TeleSparse通过稀疏化神经网络减少电路约束，并通过神经传送优化激活函数范围，从而降低内存和证明生成成本。

Result: TeleSparse将证明内存使用减少67%，证明生成时间减少46%，准确率仅下降约1%。

Conclusion: TeleSparse为ZK友好的模型设计开辟了新方向，推动了可扩展且资源高效的深度学习验证。

Abstract: Verification of the integrity of deep learning inference is crucial for
understanding whether a model is being applied correctly. However, such
verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially
sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct
Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the
capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data.
However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and
large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead.
  We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce
practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental
challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1)
Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous
constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation
costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models,
enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2)
Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by
optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation
for narrowing activation functions' range.
  TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by
46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We
implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its
effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet,
MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new
directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable,
resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.

Motivation: 解决手动标注偏好数据的高成本问题及自奖励方法中的偏差放大问题。

Method: 采用目标模型与评判模型协作的两玩家马尔可夫游戏，引入外部工具减少偏差，并通过反馈机制优化提示。

Result: 生成58K高质量偏好对（Anyprefer-V1），在21个数据集的四类应用中平均提升显著（最高30.05%）。

Conclusion: Anyprefer有效提升模型对齐性能，为偏好学习提供高质量数据解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with
human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such
data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a
self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own
preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model
shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To
address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize
high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames
the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the
target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of
external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding
the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In
addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both
models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized
data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K
high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer
significantly improves model alignment performance across four main
applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in
five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language
understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and
16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a ubiquitous concept in numerous
domains, including the legal system. AI has the potential to revolutionize the
functioning of the judiciary and the dispensation of justice. Incorporating AI
into the legal system offers the prospect of enhancing decision-making for
judges, lawyers, and legal professionals, while concurrently providing the
public with more streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective services. The
integration of AI into the legal landscape offers manifold benefits,
encompassing tasks such as document review, legal research, contract analysis,
case prediction, and decision-making. By automating laborious and error-prone
procedures, AI has the capacity to alleviate the burden associated with these
arduous tasks. Consequently, courts around the world have begun embracing AI
technology as a means to enhance the administration of justice. However,
alongside its potential advantages, the use of AI in the judiciary poses a
range of ethical challenges. These ethical quandaries must be duly addressed to
ensure the responsible and equitable deployment of AI systems. This article
delineates the principal ethical challenges entailed in employing AI within the
judiciary and provides recommendations to effectively address these issues.

Conclusion: K-Flow通过K-振幅分解实现了多尺度生成控制，为生成模型提供了一种新的可调控方法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative learning paradigm, K-Flow, an
algorithm that flows along the $K$-amplitude. Here, $k$ is a scaling parameter
that organizes frequency bands (or projected coefficients), and amplitude
describes the norm of such projected coefficients. By incorporating the
$K$-amplitude decomposition, K-Flow enables flow matching across the scaling
parameter as time. We discuss three venues and six properties of K-Flow, from
theoretical foundations, energy and temporal dynamics, and practical
applications, respectively. Specifically, from the practical usage perspective,
K-Flow allows steerable generation by controlling the information at different
scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Flow, we conduct experiments on
unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and
molecule assembly generation. Additionally, we conduct three ablation studies
to demonstrate how K-Flow steers scaling parameter to effectively control the
resolution of image generation.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法LIFT在标签分布学习中仅关注标签内部的聚类关系，忽略了标签间的交互，且依赖单一欧氏距离构建特征，可能引入噪声和偏差。

Method: 提出LIFT-SAP方法，利用结构锚点（SAPs）结合距离和方向信息构建LSFs，并设计LDL-LIFT-SAP算法统一多视角预测结果。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上的实验表明，LIFT-SAP优于LIFT，LDL-LIFT-SAP优于其他7种算法。

Conclusion: LDL-LIFT-SAP通过多视角特征构建和标签交互捕捉，显著提升了标签分布学习的性能。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed
to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific
features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks
with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label
to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks
can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect
intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct
clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information,
rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and
comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may
arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we
introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster
interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which
enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each
instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label
Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP),
which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF
spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as
well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other
well-established algorithms.

Result: 实现了非线性双时间尺度随机逼近算法的$O(1/k)$收敛速度。

Conclusion: 本文方法显著提升了非线性双时间尺度算法的收敛性能，适用于多种优化问题。

Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an algorithm with coupled
iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning,
optimization and game control. While several prior works have obtained a mean
square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best
known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In
this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear
two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such
as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key
step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an
averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an
induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.

Abstract: We introduce Hyperparameter Controller (HyperController), a computationally
efficient algorithm for hyperparameter optimization during training of
reinforcement learning neural networks. HyperController optimizes
hyperparameters quickly while also maintaining improvement of the reinforcement
learning neural network, resulting in faster training and deployment. It
achieves this by modeling the hyperparameter optimization problem as an unknown
Linear Gaussian Dynamical System, which is a system with a state that linearly
changes. It then learns an efficient representation of the hyperparameter
objective function using the Kalman filter, which is the optimal one-step
predictor for a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System. To demonstrate the
performance of HyperController, it is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer
during training of reinforcement learning neural networks on a variety of
OpenAI Gymnasium environments. In four out of the five Gymnasium environments,
HyperController achieves highest median reward during evaluation compared to
other algorithms. The results exhibit the potential of HyperController for
efficient and stable training of reinforcement learning neural networks.

Result: 在多项选择数据集上，该方法减少了向高成本大模型的延迟，性能优于标准级联基线。

Conclusion: 双向延迟方法通过更全面的置信度估计，显著提升了模型级联的效率和效果。

Abstract: Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but
powerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively
applying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to
largest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are
not sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited
small model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large
model, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore
propose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of
small and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy
for the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence
to enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to
improve post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves
cascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy
model to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the
proposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding
improvements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in
deferrals to more costly models.

Abstract: We consider a model of Bayesian observational learning in which a sequence of
agents receives a private signal about an underlying binary state of the world.
Each agent makes a decision based on its own signal and its observations of
previous agents. A central planner seeks to improve the accuracy of these
signals by allocating a limited budget to enhance signal quality across agents.
We formulate and analyze the budget allocation problem and propose two optimal
allocation strategies. At least one of these strategies is shown to maximize
the probability of achieving a correct information cascade.

Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for
localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as
thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting
for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the
immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data
assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of
machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an
already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in
the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel
method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast
precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to
learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a
generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series
data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial
research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67,
SSIM = 0.9943) used for the given dataset using UNet with Axial Transformer.

Abstract: Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large graph
without requiring full knowledge of the entire graph. These substructures are
typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be
approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the
graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying
specific local clusters when very few labeled data is given, which we term
semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the
unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The
proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion
through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results
to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of
nodes and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-arts results in the low-label rates regime.

Abstract: We provide efficient algorithms for the problem of distribution learning from
high-dimensional Gaussian data where in each sample, some of the variable
values are missing. We suppose that the variables are missing not at random
(MNAR). The missingness model, denoted by $S(y)$, is the function that maps any
point $y$ in $R^d$ to the subsets of its coordinates that are seen. In this
work, we assume that it is known. We study the following two settings:
  (i) Self-censoring: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling the
true value $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ with unknown
$\mu*$ and $\Sigma*$. For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i$
subseteq $R^d$ such that $x_i = y_i$ if and only if $y_i$ in $S_i$. Otherwise,
$x_i$ is missing and takes a generic value (e.g., "?"). We design an algorithm
that learns $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ up to total variation (TV) distance epsilon,
using $poly(d, 1/\epsilon)$ samples, assuming only that each pair of
coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.
  (ii) Linear thresholding: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling
$y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and
known $\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $S$ where $S(y) = {i in
[d] : v_i^T y <= b_i}$ for some $v_1, ..., v_d$ in $R^d$ and $b_1, ..., b_d$ in
$R$. We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of
the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the
observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with
sufficiently high probability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), while demonstrating remarkable capabilities
across various applications, present significant challenges during inference
due to their substantial model size, especially when deployed on edge devices.
Activation sparsity offers a promising solution to reduce computation and
memory movement, enabling more efficient inference, particularly for
small-batch on-device applications. However, current approaches face
limitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most
advanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the
difficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios
constrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this
paper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach
capable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two
preliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the
output within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the
non-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias
terms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an
appropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building
on this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse
inference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular
value components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the
output sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models
across ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable
performance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43%
end-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.

performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing
its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在控制任务中表现良好，但在实际应用中因缺乏安全性保障而受限，现有方法难以确保安全探索。

Method: SAC-CLF框架通过任务特定的CLF设计、动态约束调整和提升控制输入平滑性来增强安全性和稳定性。

Result: 在非线性系统和卫星姿态控制实验中，SAC-CLF有效克服了现有方法的不足。

Conclusion: SAC-CLF为强化学习在现实任务中的应用提供了更安全、稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in control tasks but faces
significant challenges in real-world applications, primarily due to the absence
of safety guarantees during the learning process. Existing methods often
struggle with ensuring safe exploration, leading to potential system failures
and restricting applications primarily to simulated environments. Traditional
approaches such as reward shaping and constrained policy optimization can fail
to guarantee safety during initial learning stages, while model-based methods
using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) may
hinder efficient exploration and performance. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Soft Actor-Critic with Control Lyapunov Function
(SAC-CLF), a framework that enhances stability and safety through three key
innovations: (1) a task-specific CLF design method for safe and optimal
performance; (2) dynamic adjustment of constraints to maintain robustness under
unmodeled dynamics; and (3) improved control input smoothness while ensuring
safety. Experimental results on a classical nonlinear system and satellite
attitude control demonstrate the effectiveness of SAC-CLF in overcoming the
shortcomings of existing methods.

Result: 实验表明，PCRD生成的奖励函数在六个复杂场景中平均性能指标比人工设计高10%。

Conclusion: PCRD框架有效解决了奖励函数设计的挑战，为复杂车队协调问题提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated excellent decision-making
potential in platoon coordination problems. However, due to the variability of
coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the
time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well
performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon
coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define
the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based
cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward
function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model
(LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which
systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven
initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first
initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements
with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively
optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR
module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a
chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code
generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward
function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence
stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging
coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River
Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results
demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions
consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average
of 10\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM的推理能力可通过简单干预激活状态来调控，且无需额外训练，证明了推理任务与其他信息处理任务的相似性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in
increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason.
Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is,
however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering
approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM
when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control
vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention,
modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on
the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and
analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on
reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit
distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply
control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an
inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM
can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning
ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the
ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a
task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the
same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and
demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via
a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.

Result: 实验表明，DISCO在多样化物理数据集上预训练后表现优异，且在下游任务微调时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: DISCO通过解耦动态估计与状态预测，显著提升了预测效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system
governed by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a
short trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box
solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in
the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when
the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state
accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we
introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short
trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network,
which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework
decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a
short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator).
Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets
achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer
epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned
on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 论文通过引入序列缺失假设和平衡增强方法，显著提升了长期治疗效果估计的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Estimating long-term treatment effects has a wide range of applications in
various domains. A key feature in this context is that collecting long-term
outcomes typically involves a multi-stage process and is subject to monotone
missing, where individuals missing at an earlier stage remain missing at
subsequent stages. Despite its prevalence, monotone missing has been rarely
explored in previous studies on estimating long-term treatment effects. In this
paper, we address this gap by introducing the sequential missingness assumption
for identification. We propose three novel estimation methods, including
inverse probability weighting, sequential regression imputation, and sequential
marginal structural model (SeqMSM). Considering that the SeqMSM method may
suffer from high variance due to severe data sparsity caused by monotone
missing, we further propose a novel balancing-enhanced approach, BalanceNet, to
improve the stability and accuracy of the estimation methods. Extensive
experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed methods.

Motivation: 解决欧氏距离矩阵补全问题，提出一种新的梯度型算法，并分析其全局收敛性和恢复能力。

Method: 基于Burer-Monteiro分解的Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent（APGD）算法，通过新的上界替代随机图引理。

Result: 在样本充足时，APGD表现出精确的线性收敛行为；但在样本有限时，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: APGD在样本充足时表现优异，但样本有限时性能受限，可能表明隐式正则化的效果减弱或需要更多样本稳定梯度方向。

Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on
Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent
(APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean
distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC)
problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show
for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of
this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log
n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike
leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local
curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our
proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC
setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate
exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast
when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress
function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if
the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical
prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of
implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the
stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more
samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.

Conclusion: 研究表明JMP-L模型存在过参数化问题，通过压缩模型可以开发更轻量、高效且可扩展的基础模型，适用于分子和材料发现。

Abstract: Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have
improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer
training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation
model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with
reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages,
fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale
requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we
investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while
preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze
the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide
diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We
explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and
evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our
analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal
performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference
throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and
that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with
lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter,
faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials
discovery. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for
large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to
improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training.
In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are
treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian
spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and
structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a
joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral
regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In
addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization
phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing
the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is
evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons,
few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings,
the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental
results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework
effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality
while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly
to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient
training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of
structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a
robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and
performance.

Result: ESS提供了高度可解释和可操作的测量，可用于改进初始化策略、设计正则化器和模型蒸馏。

Conclusion: ESS揭示了内存利用的动态特性，有助于设计更高效和有效的序列模型。

Abstract: The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming
increasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To
this end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory,
to develop a quantitative measure of \textit{memory utilization}: the internal
mechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future
outputs. This metric, which we call \textbf{\textit{effective state-size}}
(ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with
\textit{input-invariant} and \textit{input-varying linear operators},
encompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention,
convolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which
either relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply
the total \textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics
provide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we
show how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform
novel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through
model distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context
delimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural
differences in how large language models utilize their available memory to
recall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into
the dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more
efficient and effective sequence models.

Result: 实验表明，SCARLET在通信成本上减少50%，同时在非独立同分布数据下保持鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: SCARLET在准确性和通信效率上优于现有基于蒸馏的联邦学习方法，适用于多样化客户端场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet
conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high
communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL
approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels) instead,
but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds,
reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating
synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation
(Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing
cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs
compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Enhanced ERA can be
tuned to adapt to non-IID data variations, ensuring robust aggregation and
performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL
methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation
of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated
remarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses
significant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization
performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to
evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes,
such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual
invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain
unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a
practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with
statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without
requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on
synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets,
including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach
aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard
baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic
systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical
step towards AI safety in healthcare. Code:

Abstract: Incremental learning that learns new classes over time after the model's
deployment is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly for industrial edge
systems, where it is difficult to communicate with a remote server to conduct
computation-intensive learning. As more classes are expected to learn after
their execution for edge devices. In this paper, we propose LODAP, a new
on-device incremental learning framework for edge systems. The key part of
LODAP is a new module, namely Efficient Incremental Module (EIM). EIM is
composed of normal convolutions and lightweight operations. During incremental
learning, EIM exploits some lightweight operations, called adapters, to
effectively and efficiently learn features for new classes so that it can
improve the accuracy of incremental learning while reducing model complexity as
well as training overhead. The efficiency of LODAP is further enhanced by a
data pruning strategy that significantly reduces the training data, thereby
lowering the training overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-100 and Tiny- ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that LODAP
improves the accuracy by up to 4.32\% over existing methods while reducing
around 50\% of model complexity. In addition, evaluations on real edge systems
demonstrate its applicability for on-device machine learning. The code is

Method: 在六种先进的FL算法上比较KAN与传统MLP，使用血液细胞分类数据集，并分析超参数（如网格大小和网络架构）对性能的影响。

Result: KAN在FL中表现优于MLP，且通过优化宽度和最小化深度可获得最佳性能。

Conclusion: KAN是联邦学习中医疗影像任务的有力替代方案，尤其在隐私保护场景下。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices
without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like
healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)
architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms
on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate
that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving
superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN
performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally,
our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal
depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these
findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving
medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for
medical imaging task.

*Lei Xu,Shanshan Wang,Emmanuel Casseau,Chenglong Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoGNNs-LLMEA的框架，结合图神经网络和大型语言模型增强的进化算法，用于高效的高层次综合（HLS）设计空间探索（DSE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HLS预测模型过于关注结构复杂性和训练损失最小化，忽视了任务特性；同时，进化算法需要大量领域知识。

Method: CoGNNs-LLMEA框架整合了任务自适应的图神经网络和语言模型增强的进化算法，直接从源代码中间表示预测结果质量（QoR）。

Result: CoGNNs在HLS后QoR预测中达到最优准确度，延迟和资源利用的平均预测误差分别降低2.8倍和3.4倍。

Conclusion: CoGNNs-LLMEA有效填补了高层次抽象与物理实现特性之间的差距，显著提升了预测效率和准确性。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization
process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores
high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware
implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this
process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These
predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the
time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However,
existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of
training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while
evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require
extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation
operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework
that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a
large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model,
CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source
code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of
results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to
tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation
outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and
physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors
by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to
baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V的可定制性使其成为加速DNN的理想选择，但需要硬件/软件协同设计以充分利用其潜力。

Method: 通过FPGA的细粒度配置性，提出新的RISC-V扩展和功能单元，分别针对半结构化和非结构化稀疏设计加速器。

Result: 半结构化和非结构化稀疏加速器分别实现3倍和4倍速度提升，结合设计可达5倍，且资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 该设计在小型FPGA上也能高效加速DNN，适用于TinyML应用。

Abstract: The customizability of RISC-V makes it an attractive choice for accelerating
deep neural networks (DNNs). It can be achieved through instruction set
extensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently
exploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach
in which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this
paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models
containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of
accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design
offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured
sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of
FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the
information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom
functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit
unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential
multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the
non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured
pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4,
respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types
of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5. Our designs consume a
small amount of additional FPGA resources such that the resulting co-designs
enable the acceleration of DNNs even on small FPGAs. We benchmark our designs
on standard TinyML applications such as keyword spotting, image classification,
and person detection.

Motivation: LLMs在需要事实准确性的领域（如工业自动化和医疗保健）表现不佳，存在幻觉、来源不可追溯和知识更新困难等问题。结合知识图谱可能解决这些问题。

Conclusion: Tripartite-GraphRAG方法有效解决了LLMs在知识密集型任务中的局限性，为实际应用提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that
demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key
limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability
(provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language
models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming
these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge
graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs
with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by
connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of
corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of
text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from
an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach
implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of
textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance
estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids
common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity
resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge
graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification
problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach
on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses
given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments
indicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of
LLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and
more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.

Method: 利用图拉普拉斯矩阵特征值构建特征矩阵掩码，结合逆傅里叶变换提取节点频率特征，优化注意力机制。

Result: 在多项基准测试中，Grafourierformer在图分类和节点分类任务中表现优于GNN和GT模型。

Conclusion: Grafourierformer通过结合结构信息和频率信息，有效区分全局趋势与局部细节，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown advantages in numerous graph structure
tasks but their self-attention mechanism ignores the generalization bias of
graphs, with existing methods mainly compensating for this bias from aspects
like position encoding, attention bias and relative distance yet still having
sub-optimal performance and being insufficient by only considering the
structural perspective of generalization bias. To address this, this paper
proposes Grafourierformer, which innovatively combines GT with inductive bias
containing Frequency-Structure information by applying Graph Fourier Transform
to the Attention Matrix: specifically, eigenvalues from the Graph Laplacian
matrix are used to construct an Eigenvalue matrix mask (reflecting node
positions and structural relationships with neighboring nodes to enable
consideration of node range structural characteristics and focus on local graph
details), and inverse Fourier transform is employed to extract node
high-frequency and low-frequency features, calculate low-frequency and
high-frequency energy, and construct a node frequency-energy matrix to filter
the eigenvalue matrix mask, allowing attention heads to incorporate both graph
structural information and node frequency information optimization, adaptively
distinguish global trends from local details, and effectively suppress
redundant information interference. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
show Grafourierformer consistently outperforms GNN and GT-based models in graph
classification and node classification tasks, with ablation experiments further
validating the effectiveness and necessity of the method. Codes are available

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中表现优异，但对内存和计算资源需求极高。现有量化方法在超低比特量化时精度下降严重，混合精度量化方法则因粒度粗导致内存开销大或精度损失。

Conclusion: FineQ通过软硬件协同设计，有效解决了LLMs量化中的精度和内存开销问题，为资源受限环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the natural language
processing paradigm but impose substantial demands on memory and computational
resources. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory
consumption of LLMs. However, advanced single-precision quantization methods
experience significant accuracy degradation when quantizing to ultra-low bits.
Existing mixed-precision quantization methods are quantized by groups with
coarse granularity. Employing high precision for group data leads to
substantial memory overhead, whereas low precision severely impacts model
accuracy. To address this issue, we propose FineQ, software-hardware co-design
for low-bit fine-grained mixed-precision quantization of LLMs. First, FineQ
partitions the weights into finer-grained clusters and considers the
distribution of outliers within these clusters, thus achieving a balance
between model accuracy and memory overhead. Then, we propose an outlier
protection mechanism within clusters that uses 3 bits to represent outliers and
introduce an encoding scheme for index and data concatenation to enable aligned
memory access. Finally, we introduce an accelerator utilizing temporal coding
that effectively supports the quantization algorithm while simplifying the
multipliers in the systolic array. FineQ achieves higher model accuracy
compared to the SOTA mixed-precision quantization algorithm at a close average
bit-width. Meanwhile, the accelerator achieves up to 1.79x energy efficiency
and reduces the area of the systolic array by 61.2%.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLM）作为弱监督信号替代昂贵专家标注对概念瓶颈模型（CBM）学习概念质量的影响。

Method: 通过实证分析，使用多种指标评估VLM-CBMs学习的概念质量，并与专家标注进行比较。

Result: VLM监督与专家标注在某些任务中存在显著差异，且概念准确性与质量相关性较弱。

Conclusion: VLM-CBMs在替代专家标注时需谨慎，概念质量与准确性不完全一致。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are neural networks designed to conjoin high
performance with ante-hoc interpretability. CBMs work by first mapping inputs
(e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their
properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or
scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and
interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The
go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert
annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in
applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing
"VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision
from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on
the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put
state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts
empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that,
depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert
annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

Motivation: Brenier势在概率测度间的最优传输中具有重要作用，但其统计学习理论尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，开发能够学习Brenier势的GANs方法。

Method: 使用ReCU网络（激活函数为max{0,x}^3）逼近Brenier势，并通过对抗训练结合交叉熵损失和凸性惩罚项确保严格凸性。

Result: 理论分析表明，高惩罚参数下所有网络均为严格凸，学习过程具有一致性。实验验证了网络在训练中学会凸性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法成功学习了Brenier势，为GANs在最优传输问题中的应用提供了理论支持和实践验证。

Abstract: Brenier proved that under certain conditions on a source and a target
probability measure there exists a strictly convex function such that its
gradient is a transport map from the source to the target distribution. This
function is called the Brenier potential. Furthermore, detailed information on
the H\"older regularity of the Brenier potential is available. In this work we
develop the statistical learning theory of generative adversarial neural
networks that learn the Brenier potential. As by the transformation of
densities formula, the density of the generated measure depends on the second
derivative of the Brenier potential, we develop the universal approximation
theory of ReCU networks with cubic activation $\mathtt{ReCU}(x)=\max\{0,x\}^3$
that combines the favorable approximation properties of H\"older functions with
a Lipschitz continuous density. In order to assure the convexity of such
general networks, we introduce an adversarial training procedure for a
potential function represented by the ReCU networks that combines the classical
discriminator cross entropy loss with a penalty term that enforces (strict)
convexity. We give a detailed decomposition of learning errors and show that
for a suitable high penalty parameter all networks chosen in the adversarial
min-max optimization problem are strictly convex. This is further exploited to
prove the consistency of the learning procedure for (slowly) expanding network
capacity. We also implement the described learning algorithm and apply it to a
number of standard test cases from Gaussian mixture to image data as target
distributions. As predicted in theory, we observe that the convexity loss
becomes inactive during the training process and the potentials represented by
the neural networks have learned convexity.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解过平滑问题，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to oversmoothing due
to their implicit homophily assumption. We mitigate this problem with a novel
scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and
extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and
high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt
embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the
benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g.,
generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and
GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily
patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to
molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on
chemoinformatics benchmarks.

Conclusion: 仅增加模型规模收益有限，未来进展需依赖更好的上下文设计。上下文理论为表示学习提供了统一的分析框架。

Abstract: This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically
characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite
the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear
what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for
various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning
is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is
producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is
imperative for further progress.
  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite
differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for
analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is
learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We
prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,
in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be
optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also
show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is
neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture
theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing
returns, and further advancements require better contexts.
  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,
including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models,
etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning
the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an
effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove
statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss
the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream
task.

Abstract: Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for
capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data
sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic
integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural
Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled
uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single
end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and
estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to
higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing
mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial
perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on both node- and
graph-level tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a
probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and
formal robustness bounds. Finally, by incorporating recent advances in graph
contrastive learning, HU-GNN maintains diverse, structurally faithful
embeddings. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet,
Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep
learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we
propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning
flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and
World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal
resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear
mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity.
The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a
multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and
magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the
global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of
lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96
for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as
an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a
promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

Motivation: 现有向量量化方法无法同时优化MSE和内积失真，且失真率未达理论最优。TurboQuant旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 随机旋转输入向量以诱导Beta分布；2. 对每维应用最优标量量化器；3. 两阶段量化（MSE量化器+1位QJL变换）以消除内积偏差。

Result: TurboQuant在理论和实验中均接近信息论下界（仅差约2.7倍），在KV缓存量化和最近邻搜索任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TurboQuant在失真率和实际应用中均优于现有方法，为向量量化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims
to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in
their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared
error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing
methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious
algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion
rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions.
TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a
concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the
near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply
apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that
MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a
two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL
(QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product
quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower
bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer,
demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a
small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our
theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve
absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality
degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search
tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in
recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.

Conclusion: 单层单头自注意力和交叉注意力机制在通用逼近性上具有强大潜力。

Abstract: We establish the universal approximation capability of single-layer,
single-head self- and cross-attention mechanisms with minimal attached
structures. Our key insight is to interpret single-head attention as an input
domain-partition mechanism that assigns distinct values to subregions. This
allows us to engineer the attention weights such that this assignment imitates
the target function. Building on this, we prove that a single self-attention
layer, preceded by sum-of-linear transformations, is capable of approximating
any continuous function on a compact domain under the $L_\infty$-norm.
Furthermore, we extend this construction to approximate any Lebesgue integrable
function under $L_p$-norm for $1\leq p <\infty$. Lastly, we also extend our
techniques and show that, for the first time, single-head cross-attention
achieves the same universal approximation guarantees.

TL;DR: 本文研究了异步联邦学习（FL）中梯度压缩和误差反馈（EF）的收敛行为，分析了不同框架下的性能，并证明了EF能有效减少梯度估计的方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异步FL中，梯度压缩和EF技术缺乏系统性研究，本文旨在填补这一空白，分析其收敛行为。

Method: 研究基于AsynFL和AsynFLC框架，改进收敛分析，并引入EF技术（AsynFLC-EF）以减少方差。

Result: 证明EF能有效减少梯度估计的方差，使AsynFLC-EF的收敛速度与AsynFL匹配，且异步延迟对EF的影响有限。

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论分析，表明EF在异步FL中具有显著优势，尤其是在高数据异构性下。

Abstract: Gradient compression is an effective technique for reducing communication
costs in federated learning (FL), and error feedback (EF) is usually adopted to
remedy the compression errors. However, there remains a lack of systematic
study on these techniques in asynchronous FL. In this paper, we fill this gap
by analyzing the convergence behaviors of FL under different frameworks. We
firstly consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and provide an
improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a
superior convergence rate than prior studies. Then, we consider a variant
framework with gradient compression, AsynFLC. We show sufficient conditions for
its convergence to the optimum, indicating the interaction between asynchronous
delay and compression rate. Our analysis also demonstrates that asynchronous
delay amplifies the variance caused by compression, thereby hindering
convergence, and such an impact is exacerbated by high data heterogeneity.
Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further
integrates EF. We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient
estimation despite asynchronous delay, which enables AsynFLC-EF to match the
convergence rate of AsynFL. We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay
on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term.
Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well.

Motivation: 联邦学习中异构数据个性化和鲁棒性分别受到关注，但结合两者的研究较少。本文旨在探索如何在部分客户端数据损坏的情况下实现个性化学习。

Method: 提出了一种针对高斯混合模型的个性化均值估计算法，适用于部分客户端数据损坏的场景。

Conclusion: 本文为联邦学习中结合个性化与鲁棒性的问题提供了初步解决方案，并展示了算法的理论性能。

Abstract: Federated learning with heterogeneous data and personalization has received
significant recent attention. Separately, robustness to corrupted data in the
context of federated learning has also been studied. In this paper we explore
combining personalization for heterogeneous data with robustness, where a
constant fraction of the clients are corrupted. Motivated by this broad
problem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its
difficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation
where the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. We give an algorithm
whose error depends almost linearly on the ratio of corrupted to uncorrupted
samples, and show a lower bound with the same behavior, albeit with a gap of a
constant factor.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注独立设置下的迁移学习，而网络数据中的依赖关系处理仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出NCR模型，结合随机网络结构，采用两步迁移学习算法和源检测机制。

Result: 理论分析显示迁移学习在存在信息源时提升收敛速度；实证表明在目标域标记数据有限时预测精度显著提高。

Conclusion: NCR框架有效解决了网络数据中的迁移学习问题，尤其在标记数据稀缺时表现优越。

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances model performance by utilizing knowledge from
related domains, particularly when labeled data is scarce. While existing
research addresses transfer learning under various distribution shifts in
independent settings, handling dependencies in networked data remains
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a high-dimensional transfer
learning framework based on network convolutional regression (NCR), inspired by
the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The NCR model incorporates
random network structure by allowing each node's response to depend on its
features and the aggregated features of its neighbors, capturing local
dependencies effectively. Our methodology includes a two-step transfer learning
algorithm that addresses domain shift between source and target networks, along
with a source detection mechanism to identify informative domains.
Theoretically, we analyze the lasso estimator in the context of a random graph
based on the Erdos-Renyi model assumption, demonstrating that transfer learning
improves convergence rates when informative sources are present. Empirical
evaluations, including simulations and a real-world application using Sina
Weibo data, demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy,
particularly when labeled data in the target domain is limited.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂数学领域中准确性和多样性推理的挑战，避免依赖昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 使用Monte Carlo Tree Search和相似性数据增强技术训练PRM，结合GFlowNets在推理步骤级别生成多样且高质量的解决方案。

Result: 在数学基准测试中显著提升准确性和多样性（如Llama3.2-3B在MATH Level 5上绝对准确率提升2.59%），并能泛化到未见数据集（SAT MATH上提升9.4%）。

Conclusion: PRM引导的GFlowNets为提升大型语言模型的数学推理能力提供了有效途径，具有更强的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is
evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly
human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward
Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a
similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level
reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets
naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards,
as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both
accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g.,
+2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective
generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work
demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing
more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SGD在训练两层神经网络时的动态行为，特别是在广泛宽度和发散条件数情况下的表现。

Method: 使用SGD训练学生网络以最小化均方误差（MSE）目标，分析其动态和信号方向恢复的过渡时间。

Result: 在幂律设置下，确定了MSE损失关于训练样本数、SGD步数和学生网络参数数的标度律指数。

Conclusion: 尽管单个教师神经元的学习表现出突然的过渡，但多个学习曲线的叠加导致累积目标的平滑标度律。

Abstract: We study the complexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for
learning a two-layer neural network with $P$ neurons on isotropic Gaussian
data: $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{p=1}^P a_p\cdot
\sigma(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{v}_p^*\rangle)$, $\boldsymbol{x} \sim
\mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where the activation
$\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an even function with information exponent
$k_*>2$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion),
$\{\boldsymbol{v}^*_p\}_{p\in[P]}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal
directions, and the non-negative second-layer coefficients satisfy $\sum_{p}
a_p^2=1$. We focus on the challenging ``extensive-width'' regime $P\gg 1$ and
permit diverging condition number in the second-layer, covering as a special
case the power-law scaling $a_p\asymp p^{-\beta}$ where
$\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We provide a precise analysis of SGD dynamics for
the training of a student two-layer network to minimize the mean squared error
(MSE) objective, and explicitly identify sharp transition times to recover each
signal direction. In the power-law setting, we characterize scaling law
exponents for the MSE loss with respect to the number of training samples and
SGD steps, as well as the number of parameters in the student neural network.
Our analysis entails that while the learning of individual teacher neurons
exhibits abrupt transitions, the juxtaposition of $P\gg 1$ emergent learning
curves at different timescales leads to a smooth scaling law in the cumulative
objective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式——模块化机器学习（MML），旨在解决大语言模型（LLMs）在推理、事实一致性和可解释性方面的局限性。MML通过分解LLMs的复杂结构为三个相互依赖的组件，以增强其反事实推理能力、减少幻觉，并提升公平性、安全性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多个领域取得了显著进展，但在推理、事实一致性和可解释性方面仍存在关键限制。为了克服这些限制，作者提出了模块化机器学习（MML）范式。

Method: MML将LLMs分解为三个组件：模块化表示、模块化模型和模块化推理。通过解耦语义组件、灵活的任务自适应设计以及逻辑驱动的决策过程，MML提升了LLMs的能力。具体实现利用了解耦表示学习、神经架构搜索和神经符号学习等技术。

Result: MML范式能够明确LLMs的内部工作机制，支持灵活的模型设计，并实现可解释的决策过程。同时，论文指出了整合连续神经和离散符号过程、联合优化和计算可扩展性等关键挑战。

Conclusion: MML范式与LLMs的结合有望填补统计学习与形式推理之间的鸿沟，为构建鲁棒、适应性强且可信赖的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning
research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,
etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual
consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning
paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward
new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three
interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular
reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,
mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and
transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the
internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic
components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable
interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible
implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as
disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and
neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the
integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint
optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research
directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the
MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical
(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for
robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world
applications.

Motivation: 现有通信库（如RCCL和Cray-MPICH）在Frontier等系统上存在网络和计算资源利用率低或扩展性问题。

Method: 开发了PCCL，专门优化了all-gather和reduce-scatter操作，以最大化利用网络和计算资源。

Result: PCCL在2048 GCDs的Frontier上比RCCL快6-33倍，比Cray-MPICH快28-70倍；在GPT-3风格训练中，对7B和13B参数模型分别提速60%和40%。

Conclusion: PCCL显著提升了大规模LLM训练的通信效率，解决了现有库的局限性。

Abstract: We evaluate the current state of collective communication on GPU-based
supercomputers for large language model (LLM) training at scale. Existing
libraries such as RCCL and Cray-MPICH exhibit critical limitations on systems
such as Frontier -- Cray-MPICH underutilizes network and compute resources,
while RCCL suffers from severe scalability issues. To address these challenges,
we introduce PCCL, a communication library with highly optimized
implementations of all-gather and reduce-scatter operations tailored for
distributed deep learning workloads. PCCL is designed to maximally utilize all
available network and compute resources and to scale efficiently to thousands
of GPUs. It achieves substantial performance improvements, delivering 6-33x
speedups over RCCL and 28-70x over Cray-MPICH for all-gather on 2048 GCDs of
Frontier. These gains translate directly to end-to-end performance: in
large-scale GPT-3-style training, PCCL provides up to 60% and 40% speedups over
RCCL for 7B and 13B parameter models, respectively.

TL;DR: FlashOverlap是一种轻量级设计，通过瓦片级重叠、无干扰计算和通信无关性，显著提升多GPU系统中的通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多GPU计算中，GPU间通信成为瓶颈，尤其是在消费级GPU上。现有设计无法同时满足瓦片级重叠、无干扰计算和通信无关性。

Method: 提出FlashOverlap，利用新型信号机制识别瓦片级数据依赖，并通过重新排列数据到连续地址实现高效通信。

Result: 实验显示FlashOverlap最高可提速1.65倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlashOverlap通过轻量级设计有效解决了多GPU通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable success across various
applications, driving the demand for multi-GPU computing. Inter-GPU
communication becomes a bottleneck in multi-GPU computing systems, particularly
on consumer-grade GPUs. By exploiting concurrent hardware execution,
overlapping computation and communication latency is an effective technique for
mitigating the communication overhead. We identify that an efficient and
adaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise overlapping to
maximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free computation to
maintain the original computational performance, and (3) communication
agnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying communication
primitives. Nevertheless, current designs fail to simultaneously optimize for
all of those features.
  To address the issue, we propose FlashOverlap, a lightweight design
characterized by tile-wise overlapping, interference-free computation, and
communication agnosticism. FlashOverlap utilizes a novel signaling mechanism to
identify tile-wise data dependency without interrupting the computation
process, and reorders data to contiguous addresses, enabling communication by
simply calling NCCL APIs. Experiments show that such a lightweight design
achieves up to 1.65x speedup, outperforming existing works in most cases.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习（FL）中，组织间缺乏有效协作机制，导致信任与资源效率的权衡问题。

Method: 开发了\proj框架，采用去中心化编排和分布式存储，支持同步和异步模式处理延迟问题。

Result: 实验表明，\proj在性能上与理想的多级集中式FL相当，同时实现了信任和资源的最优利用。

Conclusion: \proj为跨组织联邦学习提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，解决了信任与资源效率的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in
which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients
and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the
data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware
ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate
independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to
the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in
balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a
third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel
FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable.
Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local
models directly, which requires significant computational resources for
validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and
resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we
develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called \proj, which uses
decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. \proj provides flexibility
to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous
modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that
\proj achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL
while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.

Motivation: 当前MoE模型训练中，专家负载不均衡导致性能与准确性之间的权衡问题，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: SwiftMoE静态分区优化器状态，动态调整专家参数放置，避免迁移开销，实现资源优化分配。

Result: 与DeepSpeed和FlexMoE相比，SwiftMoE分别实现了30.5%和25.9%的更快收敛时间。

Conclusion: SwiftMoE通过创新设计，有效解决了MoE训练中的负载不均衡问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a widely adopted solution to
continue scaling model sizes without a corresponding linear increase in
compute. During MoE model training, each input token is dynamically routed to a
subset of experts -- sparsely-activated feed-forward networks -- within each
transformer layer. The distribution of tokens assigned to each expert varies
widely and rapidly over the course of training. To handle the wide load
imbalance across experts, current systems are forced to either drop tokens
assigned to popular experts, degrading convergence, or frequently rebalance
resources allocated to each expert based on popularity, incurring high state
migration overheads.
  To break this performance-accuracy tradeoff, we introduce SwiftMoE, an
adaptive MoE training system. The key insight of SwiftMoE is to decouple the
placement of expert parameters from their large optimizer state. SwiftMoE
statically partitions the optimizer of each expert across all training nodes.
Meanwhile, SwiftMoE dynamically adjusts the placement of expert parameters by
repurposing existing weight updates, avoiding migration overheads. In doing so,
SwiftMoE right-sizes the GPU resources allocated to each expert, on a
per-iteration basis, with minimal overheads. Compared to state-of-the-art MoE
training systems, DeepSpeed and FlexMoE, SwiftMoE is able to achieve a 30.5%
and 25.9% faster time-to-convergence, respectively.

computationally intensive, especially for Cherenkov detectors, where simulating
optical photon transport through complex geometries and reflective surfaces

future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our framework incorporates a suite of
generative models tailored to accelerate particle identification (PID) tasks by
offering a scalable, GPU-accelerated alternative to full Geant4-based
simulations. Designed with accessibility in mind, our simulation package
enables both DL researchers and physicists to efficiently generate
high-fidelity large-scale datasets on demand, without relying on complex
traditional simulation stacks. This flexibility supports the development and
benchmarking of novel DL-driven PID methods. Moreover, this fast simulation
pipeline represents a critical step toward enabling EIC-wide PID strategies
that depend on virtually unlimited simulated samples, spanning the full

Motivation: 现有方法中，机器人领域依赖本体感觉信息，计算机视觉依赖外感觉传感器，但两者在特征复用和对象可见性方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出M2R2多模态特征提取器，结合两种传感器信息，并引入新的预训练策略以实现特征复用。

Result: 在REASSEMBLE数据集上表现优异，比现有模型性能提升46.6%。

Conclusion: M2R2在多模态任务中表现卓越，为机器人动作分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in
both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily
focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries,
with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast,
computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras.
Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the
model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models.
Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer
vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we
address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor
tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and
exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables
the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging
multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action
segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation
study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS
tasks.

Abstract: This work focuses on the design of a deep learning-based autonomous driving
system deployed and tested on the real-world MIT Racecar to assess its
effectiveness in driving scenarios. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) translates
raw image inputs into real-time steering commands in an end-to-end learning
fashion, following the imitation learning framework. The key design challenge
is to ensure that DNN predictions are accurate and fast enough, at a high
sampling frequency, and result in smooth vehicle operation under different
operating conditions. In this study, we design and compare various DNNs, to
identify the most effective approach for real-time autonomous driving. In
designing the DNNs, we adopted an incremental design approach that involved
enhancing the model capacity and dataset to address the challenges of
real-world driving scenarios. We designed a PD system, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and
CNN-NODE, and evaluated their performance on the real-world MIT Racecar. While
the PD system handled basic lane following, it struggled with sharp turns and
lighting variations. The CNN improved steering but lacked temporal awareness,
which the CNN-LSTM addressed as it resulted in smooth driving performance. The
CNN-NODE performed similarly to the CNN-LSTM in handling driving dynamics, yet
with slightly better driving performance. The findings of this research
highlight the importance of iterative design processes in developing robust
DNNs for autonomous driving applications. The experimental video is available

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Advanced Driving Systems (ADS)
are key to improving road safety, yet most existing implementations focus
primarily on the vehicle ahead, neglecting the behavior of following vehicles.
This shortfall often leads to chain reaction collisions in high speed, densely
spaced traffic particularly when a middle vehicle suddenly brakes and trailing
vehicles cannot respond in time. To address this critical gap, we propose a
novel longitudinal control and collision avoidance algorithm that integrates
adaptive cruising with emergency braking. Leveraging deep reinforcement
learning, our method simultaneously accounts for both leading and following
vehicles. Through a data preprocessing framework that calibrates real-world
sensor data, we enhance the robustness and reliability of the training process,
ensuring the learned policy can handle diverse driving conditions. In simulated
high risk scenarios (e.g., emergency braking in dense traffic), the algorithm
effectively prevents potential pile up collisions, even in situations involving
heavy duty vehicles. Furthermore, in typical highway scenarios where three
vehicles decelerate, the proposed DRL approach achieves a 99% success rate far
surpassing the standard Federal Highway Administration speed concepts guide,
which reaches only 36.77% success under the same conditions.

Abstract: Ensuring safety and robustness of robot skills is becoming crucial as robots
are required to perform increasingly complex and dynamic tasks. The former is
essential when performing tasks in cluttered environments, while the latter is
relevant to overcome unseen task situations. This paper addresses the challenge
of ensuring both safety and robustness in dynamic robot skills learned from
demonstrations. Specifically, we build on neural contractive dynamical systems
to provide robust extrapolation of the learned skills, while designing a
full-body obstacle avoidance strategy that preserves contraction stability via
diffeomorphic transforms. This is particularly crucial in complex environments
where implicit scene representations, such as Signed Distance Fields (SDFs),
are necessary. To this end, our framework called Signed Distance Field
Diffeomorphic Transform, leverages SDFs and flow-based diffeomorphisms to
achieve contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly evaluate our
framework on synthetic datasets and several real-world robotic tasks in a
kitchen environment. Our results show that our approach locally adapts the
learned contractive vector field while staying close to the learned dynamics
and without introducing highly-curved motion paths, thus outperforming several
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 多模态接触感知的有效整合可以加速开发高效接触感知操作策略，为更可靠、多功能的家庭机器人铺平道路。

Abstract: Achieving robust dexterous manipulation in unstructured domestic environments
remains a significant challenge in robotics. Even with state-of-the-art robot
learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only
on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions,
visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To
address these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that
integrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral
visual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch
provides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales,
which is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks.
Experiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over
commercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and
scalable. We then use this multi-modal tactile feedback along with
visuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from
human demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly
outperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation
policies. This paper highlights how effectively integrating multi-modal contact
sensing can hasten the development of effective contact-aware manipulation
policies, paving the way for more reliable and versatile domestic robots. More

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义SLAM系统依赖2D真实先验监督，但在真实环境中信号稀疏且噪声大，限制了性能。

Method: 提出GSFF-SLAM，利用3D高斯泼溅和特征场独立优化特征梯度，支持多种2D先验的语义重建。

Result: 在跟踪精度和渲染质量上优于现有方法，使用2D真实先验时达到95.03% mIoU，速度提升2.9倍。

Conclusion: GSFF-SLAM在稀疏和噪声信号下表现出色，为语义3D场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction is essential for autonomous robots to
perform complex interactions. Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates
pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified
framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely
on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity
and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this
challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of
appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently
optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using
various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both
tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D
ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with
only marginal performance degradation.

Abstract: SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing
robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment.
SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic
motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D
representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly
degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks
such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel
'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks
to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the
impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and
integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a
2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in
recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate
substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and
errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping
applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach
on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps.
The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as
floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems.
Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field,
improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight
into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.

Result: 在实时数据和多种复杂环境中验证了方法的有效性，生成的地图质量显著优于现有SLAM算法。

Conclusion: TT-OGM显著提升了2D SLAM在复杂场景中的地图质量、准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for
robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and
previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable
improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry
and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in
large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent
estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map
quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and
unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps
according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in
exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness
for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes.
To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy
Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation
techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map
quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data
generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large
enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in
real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its
generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of
large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the
creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the
capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and
reliability.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在零样本场景中表现良好，但存在视觉编码限制和高计算开销问题，不适用于实时机器人环境。

Method: NORA采用Qwen-2.5-VL-3B多模态模型作为主干，结合970k真实机器人演示数据和FAST+分词器，优化视觉推理和动作生成。

Result: 实验表明，NORA在任务性能上优于现有大型VLA模型，同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NORA为实时机器人自主性提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promising performance
in zero-shot scenarios, demonstrating impressive task execution and reasoning
capabilities. However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of
visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object
grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational
overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these
models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational
overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments,
where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of
existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts
the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior
visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding.
Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations
and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA
models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced
computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time
robotic autonomy.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for enabling real-time imitation of
human head motion by a Nao robot, with a primary focus on elevating human-robot
interactions. By using the robust capabilities of the MediaPipe as a computer
vision library and the DeepFace as an emotion recognition library, this
research endeavors to capture the subtleties of human head motion, including
blink actions and emotional expressions, and seamlessly incorporate these
indicators into the robot's responses. The result is a comprehensive framework
which facilitates precise head imitation within human-robot interactions,
utilizing a closed-loop approach that involves gathering real-time feedback
from the robot's imitation performance. This feedback loop ensures a high
degree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2
score of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw. Notably, the proposed approach holds
promise in improving communication for children with autism, offering them a
valuable tool for more effective interaction. In essence, proposed work
explores the integration of real-time head imitation and real-time emotion
recognition to enhance human-robot interactions, with potential benefits for

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法提升了AVs在变道场景中的安全性和效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了AVs与HVs交互中的意图估计问题，为安全变道提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Since the emergence of autonomous driving technology, it has advanced rapidly
over the past decade. It is becoming increasingly likely that autonomous
vehicles (AVs) would soon coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the
roads. Currently, safety and reliable decision-making remain significant
challenges, particularly when AVs are navigating lane changes and interacting
with surrounding HVs. Therefore, precise estimation of the intentions of
surrounding HVs can assist AVs in making more reliable and safe lane change
decision-making. This involves not only understanding their current behaviors
but also predicting their future motions without any direct communication.
However, distinguishing between the passing and yielding intentions of
surrounding HVs still remains ambiguous. To address the challenge, we propose a
social intention estimation algorithm rooted in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
coupled with a decision-making framework employing Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithms. To evaluate the method's performance, the proposed framework
can be tested and applied in a lane-changing scenario within a simulated
environment. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate how our approach
enhances the ability of AVs to navigate lane changes safely and efficiently on
roads.

Motivation: 研究在复合假设检验中停止时间的理论下界，以扩展现有结果的适用范围，例如无需参考度量或紧性假设。

Method: 通过分析KL散度的下界，推导出两种不同设定下的停止时间下界，并验证匹配上界的条件。

Result: 得到两个停止时间下界：1）当第一类错误率趋近于零时，下界为log(1/α)/KL_inf；2）当KL_inf趋近于零时，下界为c KL_inf^{-1} log log KL_inf^{-1}。

Conclusion: 论文在更一般的条件下证明了停止时间的下界，扩展了现有理论的应用范围。

Abstract: We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between
general composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the
setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals
$\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed
$\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where
$\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the
null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c
\operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a
universal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching
the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases.
Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form;
our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not
requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.

Abstract: As the US tax law evolves to adapt to ever-changing politico-economic
realities, tax preparation software plays a significant role in helping
taxpayers navigate these complexities. The dynamic nature of tax regulations
poses a significant challenge to accurately and timely maintaining tax software
artifacts. The state-of-the-art in maintaining tax prep software is
time-consuming and error-prone as it involves manual code analysis combined
with an expert interpretation of tax law amendments. We posit that the rigor
and formality of tax amendment language, as expressed in IRS publications,
makes it amenable to automatic translation to executable specifications (code).
Our research efforts focus on identifying, understanding, and tackling
technical challenges in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
ChatGPT and Llama, to faithfully extract code differentials from IRS
publications and automatically integrate them with the prior version of the
code to automate tax prep software maintenance.

Abstract: Pre-trained code models rely heavily on high-quality pre-training data,
particularly human-written reference comments that bridge code and natural
language. However, these comments often become outdated as software evolves,
degrading model performance. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating
high-quality code comments. We investigate whether replacing human-written
comments with LLM-generated ones improves pre-training datasets. Since standard
metrics cannot assess reference comment quality, we propose two novel
reference-free evaluation tasks: code-comment inconsistency detection and
semantic code search. Results show that LLM-generated comments are more
semantically consistent with code than human-written ones, as confirmed by
manual evaluation. Leveraging this finding, we rebuild the CodeSearchNet
dataset with LLM-generated comments and re-pre-train CodeT5. Evaluations
demonstrate that models trained on LLM-enhanced data outperform those using
original human comments in code summarization, generation, and translation
tasks. This work validates rebuilding pre-training datasets with LLMs to
advance code intelligence, challenging the traditional reliance on human
reference comments.

Abstract: Bug reports contain the information developers need to triage and fix

to delays and excessive manual effort spent on bug triage and resolution. In
this paper, we explore whether Instruction fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) can automatically transform casual, unstructured bug reports into
high-quality, structured bug reports adhering to a standard template. We
evaluate three open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (\emph{Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and
Llama 3.2}) against ChatGPT-4o, measuring performance on established metrics
such as CTQRS, ROUGE, METEOR, and SBERT. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5 achieves a CTQRS score of \textbf{77%}, outperforming both fine-tuned
Mistral (\textbf{71%}), Llama 3.2 (\textbf{63%}) and ChatGPT in 3-shot learning
(\textbf{75%}). Further analysis reveals that Llama 3.2 shows higher accuracy
of detecting missing fields particularly Expected Behavior and Actual Behavior,
while Qwen 2.5 demonstrates superior performance in capturing
Steps-to-Reproduce, with an F1 score of 76%. Additional testing of the models
on other popular projects (e.g., Eclipse, GCC) demonstrates that our approach
generalizes well, achieving up to \textbf{70%} CTQRS in unseen projects' bug
reports. These findings highlight the potential of instruction fine-tuning in
automating structured bug report generation, reducing manual effort for

substitution attacks. Although existing identifier substitution attackers
demonstrate high success rates, they often produce adversarial examples with
unnatural code patterns. In this paper, we systematically assess the quality of
adversarial examples using LLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that over 80%
of adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art identifier substitution
attackers (e.g., ALERT) are actually detectable. Based on this insight, we
propose EP-Shield, a unified framework for evaluating and purifying identifier
substitution attacks via naturalness-aware reasoning. Specifically, we first
evaluate the naturalness of code and identify the perturbed adversarial code,
then purify it so that the victim model can restore correct prediction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EP-Shield over adversarial
fine-tuning (up to 83.36% improvement) and its lightweight design 7B
parameters) with GPT-4-level performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于软件测试原理的框架MMT4NL，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的上下文学习（ICL）可信度，通过对抗性扰动和软件测试技术揭示其潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在上下文学习中表现出强大的适应性，但它们对微妙的对抗性扰动和语言变化仍表现出不可预测的行为，需要一种系统化的方法来评估其可信度。

Method: 提出MMT4NL框架，利用对抗性扰动和软件测试技术，通过生成变形对抗样本来量化并定位ICL设计中的缺陷。

Result: 实验在情感分析和问答任务中应用MMT4NL，成功揭示了当前先进LLMs中的多种语言缺陷。

Conclusion: MMT4NL为评估LLMs的ICL能力提供了一种新方法，有助于提升其在实际应用中的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
language models (LLMs), enabling them to perform new tasks based on a few
provided examples without explicit fine-tuning. Despite their impressive
adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial
perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic
variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software
testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness
of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software
testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic
capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around
the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order
to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is
to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing
the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment
analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various
linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.

*Vahid Garousi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过多声文献综述（MLR）量化了ChatGPT在不同领域和软件开发生命周期（SDLC）阶段的错误率，揭示了其可靠性的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ChatGPT等大型语言模型（LLM）在多个领域广泛应用，但其可靠性问题仍引发担忧，尤其是在不同领域和SDLC阶段中的错误率。

Method: 研究采用多声文献综述（MLR），收集截至2025年的学术研究、报告、基准测试和灰色文献数据，按领域和SE阶段分组，并通过箱线图可视化错误分布。

Result: 错误率因领域和模型版本而异。医疗领域错误率为8%-83%，商业和经济领域从GPT-3.5的50%降至GPT-4的15-20%。SE中，需求和设计阶段错误率较低（5-20%），而编码、测试和维护阶段较高（10-50%）。

Conclusion: 尽管ChatGPT的可靠性有所提升，但其错误率仍不可忽视，尤其是在关键领域。完全依赖ChatGPT而不进行人工监督存在风险，需持续评估和验证以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Context: ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) are widely used
across healthcare, business, economics, engineering, and software engineering
(SE). Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability,
especially their error rates across domains and the software development
lifecycle (SDLC).
  Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error
rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides
an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how
reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).
  Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data
from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025.
Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were
grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error
distributions.
  Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates
ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50%
with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%.
Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over
50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates
(~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability
(10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability.
  Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error
rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human
oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation
and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在多语言调试中表现出色，但Verilog调试领域尚未充分探索。

Method: VeriDebug通过嵌入技术检索内部信息并修复错误，统一了错误检测和修复的共享参数空间。

Result: VeriDebugLoc模型在错误修复准确率（Acc1）上达到64.7%，远超现有开源方法（11.3%）和GPT-3.5-turbo（36.6%）。

Conclusion: VeriDebug为Verilog调试提供了更高效的解决方案，优于传统方法和现有模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs
to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present
VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided
correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing
methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve
internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug
detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously
learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive
embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of
VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves
64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing
open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source
alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo
(36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.

Motivation: 需求工程中定性数据分析的传统方法耗时且依赖人工，研究旨在利用大型语言模型提升效率和准确性。

Method: 评估了LLMs在归纳（零样本）和演绎（单样本、少样本）标注任务中的表现，重点关注GPT-4的性能。

Result: GPT-4在演绎标注任务中与人类分析师达成高度一致（Cohen's Kappa > 0.7），零样本表现有限，详细提示显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是GPT-4）能有效支持需求工程中的定性数据分析，减少人工负担并保持标注质量，同时为系统化软件设计提供结构化标签。

Abstract: Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential for developing complex and
regulated software projects. Given the challenges in transforming stakeholder
inputs into consistent software designs, Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA)
provides a systematic approach to handling free-form data. However, traditional
QDA methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on manual effort. In this
paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4,
Mistral, and LLaMA-2, to improve QDA tasks in RE. Our study evaluates LLMs'
performance in inductive (zero-shot) and deductive (one-shot, few-shot)
annotation tasks, revealing that GPT-4 achieves substantial agreement with
human analysts in deductive settings, with Cohen's Kappa scores exceeding 0.7,
while zero-shot performance remains limited. Detailed, context-rich prompts
significantly improve annotation accuracy and consistency, particularly in
deductive scenarios, and GPT-4 demonstrates high reliability across repeated
runs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support QDA in RE by
reducing manual effort while maintaining annotation quality. The structured
labels automatically provide traceability of requirements and can be directly
utilized as classes in domain models, facilitating systematic software design.

Result: 基础LLMs设计迭代能力有限，但RL增强的7B参数模型表现优于现有基础模型和人类专家。

Conclusion: RL训练的LLMs可作为复杂工程优化的有效工具，拓展LLMs在非软件工程领域的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software engineering, but their
application to physical engineering domains remains underexplored. This paper
evaluates LLMs' capabilities in high-powered rocketry design through
RocketBench, a benchmark connecting LLMs to high-fidelity rocket simulations.
We test models on two increasingly complex design tasks: target altitude
optimization and precision landing challenges. Our findings reveal that while
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong baseline engineering knowledge, they
struggle to iterate on their designs when given simulation results and
ultimately plateau below human performance levels. However, when enhanced with
reinforcement learning (RL), we show that a 7B parameter model outperforms both
SoTA foundation models and human experts. This research demonstrates that
RL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering
optimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software
development.

Motivation: 研究竞争团队间的动态博弈，特别是代理在团队内协作同时对抗其他团队的情景，填补了完全合作与完全对抗之间的研究空白。

Method: 提出扩散学习算法，针对零和博弈（弱跨团队子图交互）和非零和博弈（强跨团队子图交互）两类问题。

Result: 在合理假设下分析了算法的稳定性性能，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 扩散学习算法能有效处理竞争团队间的动态博弈问题，实验验证了其在实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams,
each consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative
settings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game
aims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their
objectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the
competition, agents share strategic information within their own team while
simultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team.
We propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of
this network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph
interactions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team
subgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed
algorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results
through experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.

Motivation: 探讨不同参数调优方法对萤火虫算法性能的影响，以验证其灵活性和有效性。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛、拟蒙特卡洛和拉丁超立方采样三种方法调优FA参数，并通过统计假设检验（如t检验、F检验、Friedman检验和ANOVA）分析结果。

Result: 调优方法对FA性能无显著影响，且调优后的参数值独立于调优方法。

Conclusion: FA在解决优化问题时具有灵活性，三种调优方法均可有效调优其参数。

Abstract: There are many different nature-inspired algorithms in the literature, and
almost all such algorithms have algorithm-dependent parameters that need to be
tuned. The proper setting and parameter tuning should be carried out to
maximize the performance of the algorithm under consideration. This work is the
extension of the recent work on parameter tuning by Joy et al. (2024) presented
at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2024), and the
Firefly Algorithm (FA) is tuned using three different methods: the Monte Carlo
method, the Quasi-Monte Carlo method and the Latin Hypercube Sampling. The FA
with the tuned parameters is then used to solve a set of six different
optimization problems, and the possible effect of parameter setting on the
quality of the optimal solutions is analyzed. Rigorous statistical hypothesis
tests have been carried out, including Student's t-tests, F-tests,
non-parametric Friedman tests and ANOVA. Results show that the performance of
the FA is not influenced by the tuning methods used. In addition, the tuned
parameter values are largely independent of the tuning methods used. This
indicates that the FA can be flexible and equally effective in solving
optimization problems, and any of the three tuning methods can be used to tune
its parameters effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间重标Langevin动力学的自适应步长MCMC采样框架，通过引入额外自由度动态调整步长，提升数值稳定性和收敛速度。


<details>

Motivation: 传统固定步长MCMC采样在复杂后验分布中可能效率低下或数值不稳定，需动态调整步长以优化性能。

Method: 通过引入额外变量定义时间重参数化，结合辅助松弛方程动态控制步长，无需修改物理系统的漂移项。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Neal's funnel和MNIST数据分类的贝叶斯神经网络中，显著提升了稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架易于实现且兼容现有固定步长Langevin积分器，为复杂后验采样提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a framework for adaptive-stepsize MCMC sampling based on
time-rescaled Langevin dynamics, in which the stepsize variation is dynamically
driven by an additional degree of freedom. Our approach augments the phase
space by an additional variable which in turn defines a time
reparameterization. The use of an auxiliary relaxation equation allows
accumulation of a moving average of a local monitor function and provides for
precise control of the timestep while circumventing the need to modify the
drift term in the physical system. Our algorithm is straightforward to
implement and can be readily combined with any off-the-peg fixed-stepsize
Langevin integrator. As a particular example, we consider control of the
stepsize by monitoring the norm of the log-posterior gradient, which takes
inspiration from the Adam optimizer, the stepsize being automatically reduced
in regions of steep change of the log posterior and increased on plateaus,
improving numerical stability and convergence speed. As in Adam, the stepsize
variation depends on the recent history of the gradient norm, which enhances
stability and improves accuracy compared to more immediate control approaches.
We demonstrate the potential benefit of this method--both in accuracy and in
stability--in numerical experiments including Neal's funnel and a Bayesian
neural network for classification of MNIST data.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the forthcoming era of 6G networks, characterized by unprecedented data
rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive connectivity, effective management of
Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is essential. VNFs are software-based
counterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and
scalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as
ordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network
services. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network
infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency
constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based
methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven
approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the
capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic
framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By
utilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex
inter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized
decision-making processes. Additionally, we enhance training stability and
convergence using $\epsilon$-LoPe exploration strategy as well as Asymptotic
Return Normalization. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms
of long-term acceptance rates, resource utilization efficiency, and
scalability, while achieving rapid inference. This study not only advances
intelligent network orchestration by delivering a scalable and robust solution
for SFC partitioning within emerging 6G environments, but also bridging recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the optimization of
next-generation networks.

Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on
various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and
accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally,
they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we
introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing
high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these
primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching
method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing
fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a
flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable
experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for
generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3)
Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies,
contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for
extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate
that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song
generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are

Conclusion: CAV2vec通过自监督学习和模态对齐，有效提升了音频-视觉语音识别在损坏环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual
modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments
where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has
largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual
corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also
detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel
self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed
to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation
approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to
predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input
frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills
cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean
audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted
audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space
caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust
audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that
the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition
accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CIs) play a vital role in restoring hearing for
individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss by directly
stimulating the auditory nerve with electrical signals. While traditional
coding strategies, such as the advanced combination encoder (ACE), have proven
effective, they are constrained by their adaptability and precision. This paper
investigates the use of deep learning (DL) techniques to generate
electrodograms for CIs, presenting our model as an advanced alternative. We
compared the performance of our model with the ACE strategy by evaluating the
intelligibility of reconstructed audio signals using the short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI) metric. The results indicate that our model achieves a
STOI score of 0.6031, closely approximating the 0.6126 score of the ACE
strategy, and offers potential advantages in flexibility and adaptability. This
study underscores the benefits of incorporating artificial intelligent (AI)
into CI technology, such as enhanced personalization and efficiency.

Motivation: CMIP模型在孟加拉湾的预测存在显著偏差，尤其是海表温度（SST）的预测误差较大，需要更精确的偏差校正方法。

Method: 提出了三种深度学习架构（UNet、双向LSTM和ConvLSTM）用于偏差校正，并与线性回归和EDCDF方法进行比较。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在气候模型偏差校正中具有显著优势，尤其是UNet架构表现最佳。

Abstract: Climate change affects ocean temperature, salinity and sea level, impacting
monsoons and ocean productivity. Future projections by Global Climate Models
based on shared socioeconomic pathways from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP) are widely used to understand the effects of climate change.
However, CMIP models have significant bias compared to reanalysis in the Bay of
Bengal for the time period when both projections and reanalysis are available.
For example, there is a 1.5C root mean square error (RMSE) in the sea surface
temperature (SST) projections of the climate model CNRM-CM6 compared to the
Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5). We develop a suite of data-driven deep
learning models for bias correction of climate model projections and apply it
to correct SST projections of the Bay of Bengal. We propose the use of three
different deep neural network architectures: convolutional encoder-decoder
UNet, Bidirectional LSTM and ConvLSTM. We also use a baseline linear regression
model and the Equi-Distant Cumulative Density Function (EDCDF) bias correction
method for comparison and evaluating the impact of the new deep learning
models. All bias correction models are trained using pairs of monthly CMIP6
projections and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as input and output. Historical
data (1950-2014) and future projection data (2015-2020) of CNRM-CM6 are used
for training and validation, including hyperparameter tuning. Testing is
performed on future projection data from 2021 to 2024. Detailed analysis of the
three deep neural models has been completed. We found that the UNet
architecture trained using a climatology-removed CNRM-CM6 projection as input

### [238] [Two-parameter superposable S-curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19488)
*Vijay Prakash S*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过奇异摄动直线方程生成的S形曲线，提出其可作为统计模型，用于从均匀分布到单值零熵的过渡，并在鸢尾花数据集上验证了其模式识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨S形曲线如何从均匀分布过渡到单值分布，并验证其作为统计模型的实用性。

Method: 通过奇异摄动直线方程生成S形曲线，将其叠加后拟合到鸢尾花数据集，分析其模式识别能力。

Result: S形曲线能有效表示非均匀模式，但参数估计对初始条件敏感。

Conclusion: S形曲线可作为统计模型，但需注意参数估计的局限性。

Abstract: Straight line equation $y=mx$ with slope $m$, when singularly perturbed as
$ay^3+y=mx$ with a positive parameter $a$, results in S-shaped curves or
S-curves on a real plane. As $a\rightarrow 0$, we get back $y=mx$ which is a
cumulative distribution function of a continuous uniform distribution that
describes the occurrence of every event in an interval to be equally probable.
As $a\rightarrow\infty$, the derivative of $y$ has finite support only at $y=0$
resembling a degenerate distribution. Based on these arguments, in this work,
we propose that these S-curves can represent maximum entropy uniform
distribution to a zero entropy single value. We also argue that these S-curves
are superposable as they are only parametrically nonlinear but fundamentally
linear. So far, the superposed forms have been used to capture the patterns of
natural systems such as nonlinear dynamics of biological growth and kinetics of
enzyme reactions. Here, we attempt to use the S-curve and its superposed form
as a statistical model. We fit the models on a classical dataset containing
flower measurements of iris plants and analyze their usefulness in pattern
recognition. Based on these models, we claim that any non-uniform pattern can
be represented as a singular perturbation to uniform distribution. However, our
parametric estimation procedure have some limitations such as sensitivity to
initial conditions depending on the data at hand.

Motivation: 研究目的是利用机器学习和最优传输理论分析蛋白质的圆二色谱，以揭示其结构和聚类特征。

Method: 使用1-Wasserstein距离（W1）和t-SNE算法对SP175数据库中的球状蛋白质圆二色谱进行分析。

Result: W1距离与欧氏和曼哈顿度量一致且抗噪；t-SNE揭示了蛋白质的聚类结构，主要基于其二级结构组成（β-rich和α/β混合型）。

Conclusion: W1距离和t-SNE算法在分析蛋白质光谱数据中表现出色，能够有效揭示结构和聚类特征。

Abstract: We present a machine learning analysis of circular dichroism spectra of
globular proteins from the SP175 database, using the optimal transport-based
$1$-Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_1$ (with order $p=1$) and the manifold
learning algorithm $t$-SNE. Our results demonstrate that $\mathcal{W}_1$ is
consistent with both Euclidean and Manhattan metrics while exhibiting
robustness to noise. On the other hand, $t$-SNE uncovers meaningful structure
in the high-dimensional data. The clustering in the $t$-SNE embedding is
primarily determined by proteins with distinct secondary structure
compositions: one cluster predominantly contains $\beta$-rich proteins, while
the other consists mainly of proteins with mixed $\alpha/\beta$ and
$\alpha$-helical content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于金融危机中波动行为的实证证据和时间感知变化，研究市场波动与系统性不确定性的关系。

Method: 开发基于修正对数正态幂律分布的机制转换框架，分析FCIX数据，并使用弹性网络回归模型预测VIX指数。

Result: 识别出低混沌、中混沌和高混沌三种市场状态，发现宏观经济、金融、政策和地缘政治不确定性对波动动态有强预测力。

Conclusion: 研究提供了系统性不确定性如何影响金融市场实际演变和隐含波动率行为的统一视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structural dynamics of stock market volatility
through the Financial Chaos Index, a tensor- and eigenvalue-based measure
designed to capture realized volatility via mutual fluctuations among asset
prices. Motivated by empirical evidence of regime-dependent volatility behavior
and perceptual time dilation during financial crises, we develop a
regime-switching framework based on the Modified Lognormal Power-Law
distribution. Analysis of the FCIX from January 1990 to December 2023
identifies three distinct market regimes, low-chaos, intermediate-chaos, and
high-chaos, each characterized by differing levels of systemic stress,
statistical dispersion and persistence characteristics. Building upon the
segmented regime structure, we further examine the informational forces that
shape forward-looking market expectations. Using sentiment-based predictors
derived from the Equity Market Volatility tracker, we employ an elastic net
regression model to forecast implied volatility, as proxied by the VIX index.
Our findings indicate that shifts in macroeconomic, financial, policy, and
geopolitical uncertainty exhibit strong predictive power for volatility
dynamics across regimes. Together, these results offer a unified empirical
perspective on how systemic uncertainty governs both the realized evolution of
financial markets and the anticipatory behavior embedded in implied volatility
measures.

TL;DR: 本文通过对意大利Telegram生态的大规模分析，揭示了其政治话语、意识形态同质性、毒性言论的普遍性以及仇恨目标的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补对Telegram生态系统的全面理解空白，尤其是意大利语境下的政治话语和毒性言论。

Method: 利用186万条消息的网络分析、大语言模型和毒性检测工具，研究意大利Telegram中的社区形成和有害言论。

Result: 发现强烈的主题和意识形态同质性，混合意识形态社区，毒性言论的普遍化，以及针对特定群体的仇恨言论。

Conclusion: 研究首次大规模映射了意大利Telegram生态系统，为跨文化在线毒性研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative
media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and
toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena
or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader
understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill
this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere,
leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in
2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection
tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically,
and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results
show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed
ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on
particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that
toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely
normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian
discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals
independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national
hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and
intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical
divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian
Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity,
and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity
across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.

Motivation: 随着AI技术的快速发展，人类依赖AI代理处理复杂决策时，可能面临自主性丧失或被外部控制的风险。

Method: 提出一种哲学转向的AI设计方法，借鉴苏格拉底对话模式，促进分散式真理探索和开放式探究。

Result: 这种设计能够增强用户的判断力，保护其自主性，同时提升集体适应性学习。

Conclusion: 论文为保护自主性的AI系统设计了关键特征，为增强而非削弱人类判断的AI系统指明了方向。

Abstract: In the face of rapidly advancing AI technology, individuals will increasingly
rely on AI agents to navigate life's growing complexities, raising critical
concerns about maintaining both human agency and autonomy. This paper addresses
a fundamental dilemma posed by AI decision-support systems: the risk of either
becoming overwhelmed by complex decisions, thus losing agency, or having
autonomy compromised by externally controlled choice architectures reminiscent
of ``nudging'' practices. While the ``nudge'' framework, based on the use of
choice-framing to guide individuals toward presumed beneficial outcomes,
initially appeared to preserve liberty, at AI-driven scale, it threatens to
erode autonomy. To counteract this risk, the paper proposes a philosophic turn
in AI design. AI should be constructed to facilitate decentralized
truth-seeking and open-ended inquiry, mirroring the Socratic method of
philosophical dialogue. By promoting individual and collective adaptive
learning, such AI systems would empower users to maintain control over their
judgments, augmenting their agency without undermining autonomy. The paper
concludes by outlining essential features for autonomy-preserving AI systems,
sketching a path toward AI systems that enhance human judgment rather than
undermine it.

Result: 初步结果显示系统能捕获丰富互动数据、动态调整课程计划，并支持情境感知辅导。

Conclusion: 系统展现了潜力，但需进一步系统评估。

Abstract: Quantum computing education faces significant challenges due to its
complexity and the limitations of current tools; this paper introduces a novel
Intelligent Teaching Assistant for quantum computing education and details its
evolutionary design process. The system combines a knowledge-graph-augmented
architecture with two specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents: a Teaching
Agent for dynamic interaction, and a Lesson Planning Agent for lesson plan
generation. The system is designed to adapt to individual student needs, with
interactions meticulously tracked and stored in a knowledge graph. This graph
represents student actions, learning resources, and relationships, aiming to
enable reasoning about effective learning pathways. We describe the
implementation of the system, highlighting the challenges encountered and the
solutions implemented, including introducing a dual-agent architecture where
tasks are separated, all coordinated through a central knowledge graph that
maintains system awareness, and a user-facing tag system intended to mitigate
LLM hallucination and improve user control. Preliminary results illustrate the
system's potential to capture rich interaction data, dynamically adapt lesson
plans based on student feedback via a tag system in simulation, and facilitate
context-aware tutoring through the integrated knowledge graph, though
systematic evaluation is required.

Motivation: AI在电影制作中提升效率与创意，但也带来伦理与实践挑战，需探索其影响。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合理论框架（作者论、人机关系）和案例研究（《The Safe Zone》《Fast & Furious 7》《The Brutalist》）。

Result: 将AI定位为“具身工具”而非独立“他者伙伴”可保护人类创作权与艺术完整性，同时揭示AI市场的监控资本主义风险与深度伪造技术的伦理困境。

Conclusion: 提出国际监管框架和人类控制指数（HCI）等建议，以指导电影行业在AI时代保护文化多样性与伦理标准。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into film production has
revolutionized efficiency and creativity, yet it simultaneously raises critical
ethical and practical challenges. This study explores the dual impact of AI on
modern cinema through three objectives: defining the optimal human-AI
relationship, balancing creativity with automation, and developing ethical
guidelines. By employing a mixed-method approach combining theoretical
frameworks (auteur theory, human-technology relations) and case studies (The
Safe Zone, Fast & Furious 7, The Brutalist), the research reveals that
positioning AI as an "embodiment tool" rather than an independent "alterity
partner" preserves human authorship and artistic integrity. Key findings
highlight the risks of surveillance capitalism in AI-driven markets and the
ethical dilemmas of deepfake technology. The study concludes with actionable
recommendations, including international regulatory frameworks and a Human
Control Index (HCI) to quantify AI involvement. These insights aim to guide
filmmakers, policymakers, and scholars in navigating the evolving AI-cinema
landscape while safeguarding cultural diversity and ethical standards.

Method: 比较分析美国、欧洲、中国和新加坡的AI监管策略及其对人权的关注程度。

Result: 欧洲注重严格保护个人权利，美国倾向宽松监管以促进创新，中国强调国家控制和社会秩序，新加坡鼓励自我监管并遵循国际规范。

Conclusion: 需通过全球对话协调AI监管，兼顾人权保护和技术发展，反映各地区多样化的视角和优先事项。

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of human rights considerations into AI
regulatory frameworks across different IEEE regions - specifically the United
States (Region 1-6), Europe (Region 8), China (part of Region 10), and
Singapore (part of Region 10). While all acknowledge the transformative
potential of AI and the necessity of ethical guidelines, their regulatory
approaches significantly differ. Europe exhibits a rigorous framework with
stringent protections for individual rights, while the U.S. promotes innovation
with less restrictive regulations. China emphasizes state control and societal
order in its AI strategies. In contrast, Singapore's advisory framework
encourages self-regulation and aligns closely with international norms. This
comparative analysis underlines the need for ongoing global dialogue to
harmonize AI regulations that safeguard human rights while promoting
technological advancement, reflecting the diverse perspectives and priorities
of each region.

Result: 学生需提升AI素养、批判性思维和伦理意识；教师应注重GenAI整合与课程设计。

Conclusion: 教育机构需推动公平访问、明确学术诚信政策，并支持全球GenAI研究。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT are emerging
as a revolutionary tool in education that brings both positive aspects and
challenges for educators and students, reshaping how learning and teaching are
approached. This study aims to identify and evaluate the key competencies
students need to effectively engage with GenAI in education and to provide
strategies for lecturers to integrate GenAI into teaching practices. The study
applied a mixed method approach with a combination of a literature review and a
quantitative survey involving 130 students from South Asia and Europe to obtain
its findings. The literature review identified 14 essential student skills for
GenAI engagement, with AI literacy, critical thinking, and ethical AI practices
emerging as the most critical. The student survey revealed gaps in prompt
engineering, bias awareness, and AI output management. In our study of lecturer
strategies, we identified six key areas, with GenAI Integration and Curriculum
Design being the most emphasised. Our findings highlight the importance of
incorporating GenAI into education. While literature prioritized ethics and
policy development, students favour hands-on, project-based learning and
practical AI applications. To foster inclusive and responsible GenAI adoption,
institutions should ensure equitable access to GenAI tools, establish clear
academic integrity policies, and advocate for global GenAI research
initiatives.

Method: 通过分析AI对认知过载的影响机制，重新构建AI安全框架，并提出应对策略。

Result: 研究指出认知过载是连接短期危害与长期风险的桥梁，并提出了未来研究方向和政策建议。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要从认知过载的角度重新审视人机对齐问题，并探索适应性解决方案。

Abstract: Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and
complexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and
societal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is
not only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial
prerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including
existential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through
various mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic
manipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning.
The paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload,
highlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks.
It concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research
directions, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an
overload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for
future exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.

Method: 提出MODP框架，结合多目标性（考虑LLM行为）和定向提示（基于指标的提示开发）。

Result: 在摘要任务中性能提升26%，并成功部署于Dell的客服工具。

Conclusion: MODP为提示工程提供了更全面和高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to their popularity
across multiple use-cases. However, prompt engineering, the process for
optimally utilizing such models, remains approximation-driven and subjective.
Most of the current research on prompt engineering focuses on task-specific
optimization, while neglecting the behavior of the LLM under consideration
during prompt development. This paper introduces MODP -- Multi Objective
Directional Prompting, a framework based on two key concepts: 1)
multi-objectivity: the importance of considering an LLM's intrinsic behavior as
an additional objective in prompt development, and 2) directional prompting: a
metrics-driven method for prompt engineering to ensure development of robust
and high-precision prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
ideas on a summarization task, using a synthetically created dataset, achieving
a 26% performance gain over initial prompts. Finally, we apply MODP to develop
prompts for Dell's Next Best Action support tool, which is now in production
and is used by more than 10,000 internal support agents and serving millions of
customers worldwide.

Method: 方法包括固定底层结构因果模型的图结构，并分析不同算术和因果层次下的复杂性；同时研究小模型条件下的可满足性问题。

Conclusion: 结论表明，模型约束和小模型条件显著改变了可满足性问题的复杂性，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and
causal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ over finite domains,
the basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events
$X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic
terms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication
(polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a
joint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of
(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and
linear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean
satisfiability, while Moss\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms,
it is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with
interventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of
languages. However, Moss\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity
remains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a
marginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in
complexity.
  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by
constraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying
structural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and
give a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.
Second, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable
instances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with
compact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability
under small-model constraints across different settings.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种REED训练方案，用于变分自编码器（VAE），以解决潜在扩散模型在迭代图像编辑中积累噪声和伪影的问题，支持多方法迭代编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在迭代编辑同一图像时，由于反复在像素和潜在空间之间转换，会积累伪影和噪声，限制了其应用。现有方法牺牲灵活性，仅支持有限的预定义编辑操作。

Method: 通过REED训练方案改进VAE，使其在多次迭代后仍能保持图像质量，支持多种迭代编辑操作（包括扩散和传统方法）。

Result: REED-VAE在多种图像编辑场景（如基于文本和掩码的编辑）中表现优异，提高了编辑成功率和精确性。

Conclusion: REED-VAE为多方法图像编辑任务提供了新基准，增强了图像的编辑能力。

Abstract: While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their
application to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When
trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they
accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and
latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by
performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing
flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion
editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for
variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even
after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing:
users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation
building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based
operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of
REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and
mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the
overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and
precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for
the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing. Our code and models
will be available at https://github.com/galmog/REED-VAE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同优化方法（如Adam和RMSprop）的收敛速度，以验证其效率。

Method: 通过理论分析比较Adam、RMSprop和标准梯度下降的收敛速率。

Result: Adam的收敛速率为(√x -1)/(√x +1)，与动量法相同且优于RMSprop的(x-1)/(x+1)。

Conclusion: Adam在收敛速度上优于RMSprop和标准梯度下降，验证了其在优化中的高效性。

Abstract: Gradient descent based optimization methods are the methods of choice to
train deep neural networks in machine learning. Beyond the standard gradient
descent method, also suitable modified variants of standard gradient descent
involving acceleration techniques such as the momentum method and/or adaptivity
techniques such as the RMSprop method are frequently considered optimization
methods. These days the most popular of such sophisticated optimization schemes
is presumably the Adam optimizer that has been proposed in 2014 by Kingma and
Ba. A highly relevant topic of research is to investigate the speed of
convergence of such optimization methods. In particular, in 1964 Polyak showed
that the standard gradient descent method converges in a neighborhood of a
strict local minimizer with rate (x - 1)(x + 1)^{-1} while momentum achieves
the (optimal) strictly faster convergence rate (\sqrt{x} - 1)(\sqrt{x} +
1)^{-1} where x \in (1,\infty) is the condition number (the ratio of the
largest and the smallest eigenvalue) of the Hessian of the objective function
at the local minimizer. It is the key contribution of this work to reveal that
Adam also converges with the strictly faster convergence rate (\sqrt{x} -
1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-1} while RMSprop only converges with the convergence rate (x
- 1)(x + 1)^{-1}.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索BRADO算法在组合优化问题中的潜力，尤其是经典的N皇后问题。

Method: 方法包括设计成本函数引导搜索，并使用TOPSIS多准则决策过程调整配置。

Result: 结果显示BRADO在解质量和目标函数值上优于PSO、GA、ICA、ILS和LS等算法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the application of the Brain Drain Optimization
algorithm -- a swarm-based metaheuristic inspired by the emigration of
intellectual elites -- to the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem, a classic
combinatorial optimization problem, serves as a challenge for applying the
BRADO. A designed cost function guides the search, and the configurations are
tuned using a TOPSIS-based multicriteria decision making process. BRADO
consistently outperforms alternatives in terms of solution quality, achieving
fewer threats and better objective function values. To assess BRADO's efficacy,
it is benchmarked against several established metaheuristic algorithms,
including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA),
Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), and basic
Local Search (LS). The study highlights BRADO's potential as a general-purpose
solver for combinatorial problems, opening pathways for future applications in
other domains of artificial intelligence.

Fourier Gaussian Network (QFGN), a quantum-based machine learning model for
better signal representations. The frequency spectrum is well balanced by
penalizing the low-frequency components, leading to the improved expressivity
of quantum circuits. The results demonstrate that with minimal parameters, QFGN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于逆向工程量子电路编译器的优化方法，以提高透明性和识别潜在的知识产权保护优化技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强电路优化的透明度以改进跨平台调试和性能调优，同时识别商业系统中可能受知识产权保护的优化技术。

Method: 利用机器学习框架，通过分析原始电路和编译后电路之间的结构差异，推断底层优化技术。

Result: 神经网络在检测优化步骤中表现最佳，单个优化步骤的F1分数高达0.96。

Conclusion: 研究表明，编译器机密性面临威胁，需要在这一领域进行积极研究。

Abstract: Circuit compilation, a crucial process for adapting quantum algorithms to
hardware constraints, often operates as a ``black box,'' with limited
visibility into the optimization techniques used by proprietary systems or
advanced open-source frameworks. Due to fundamental differences in qubit
technologies, efficient compiler design is an expensive process, further
exposing these systems to various security threats. In this work, we take a
first step toward evaluating one such challenge affecting compiler
confidentiality, specifically, reverse-engineering compilation methodologies.
We propose a simple ML-based framework to infer underlying optimization
techniques by leveraging structural differences observed between original and
compiled circuits. The motivation is twofold: (1) enhancing transparency in
circuit optimization for improved cross-platform debugging and performance
tuning, and (2) identifying potential intellectual property (IP)-protected
optimizations employed by commercial systems. Our extensive evaluation across
thousands of quantum circuits shows that a neural network performs the best in
detecting optimization passes, with individual pass F1-scores reaching as high
as 0.96. Thus, our initial study demonstrates the viability of this threat to
compiler confidentiality and underscores the need for active research in this
area.

Conclusion: 分布式块方法通过隐式正则化提升量子神经网络的优化稳定性，为经典数据任务的量子机器学习提供了可行策略。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks hold promise for tackling computationally challenging
tasks that are intractable for classical computers. However, their practical
application is hindered by significant optimization challenges, arising from
complex loss landscapes characterized by barren plateaus and numerous local
minima. These problems become more severe as the number of parameters or qubits
increases, hampering effective training. To mitigate these optimization
challenges, particularly for quantum machine learning applied to classical
data, we employ an approach of distributing overlapping local patches across
multiple quantum neural networks, processing each patch with an independent
quantum neural network, and aggregating their outputs for prediction. In this
study, we investigate how the number of parameters and patches affects the loss
landscape geometry of this distributed quantum neural network architecture via
Hessian analysis and loss landscape visualization. Our results confirm that
increasing the number of parameters tends to lead to deeper and sharper loss
landscapes. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing the number of patches
significantly reduces the largest Hessian eigenvalue at minima. This finding
suggests that our distributed patch approach acts as a form of implicit
regularization, promoting optimization stability and potentially enhancing
generalization. Our study provides valuable insights into optimization
challenges and highlights that the distributed patch approach is a promising
strategy for developing more trainable and practical quantum machine learning
models for classical data tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线交易的快速增长，传统机器学习方法在复杂金融数据中面临可扩展性、过拟合和高计算成本的问题，量子计算和量子机器学习提供了一种潜在解决方案，但现有量子算法在噪声环境中缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出QFDNN模型，优化特征表示，减少量子比特需求和简化变分电路，并在信用卡欺诈检测和贷款资格预测数据集上进行评估。

Result: QFDNN在信用卡欺诈检测和贷款资格预测中分别达到82.2%和74.4%的准确率，并在六种噪声模型中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: QFDNN通过资源高效设计和低计算开销，增强了金融科技中的信任和安全性，支持可持续发展。

Abstract: Social financial technology focuses on trust, sustainability, and social
responsibility, which require advanced technologies to address complex
financial tasks in the digital era. With the rapid growth in online
transactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility
prediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML)
models have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches
often encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to
complexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and
quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently
processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of
subtle fraud patterns. However, existing quantum algorithms lack robustness in
noisy environments and fail to optimize performance with reduced feature sets.
To address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network
(QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that
optimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler
variational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection
and loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of
82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead.
Furthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its
robustness across various error conditions. Our findings highlight QFDNN
potential to enhance trust and security in social financial technology by
accurately detecting fraudulent transactions while supporting sustainability
through its resource-efficient design and minimal computational overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高维输出空间中容易受到后门攻击，现有防御机制不足，需要新的解决方案。

Method: SAU利用潜在空间操作和空间注意力机制隔离并移除后门触发器的潜在表示。

Result: SAU在多种后门攻击中实现100%触发器移除准确率，CLIP得分0.7023，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAU是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，能保护扩散模型免受后门攻击，同时保持图像生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where malicious modifications to the training data cause the model to
generate unintended outputs when specific triggers are present. While
classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms,
generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional
output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle
perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain
under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a
novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU
leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate
and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and
efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of
backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy.
Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing
methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality,
semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable,
and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against
backdoor attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DualBreach是一种针对LLMs和Guardrails的双重越狱框架，通过动态初始化提示和多目标优化方法，显著提高了成功率和查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在绕过安全对齐的LLMs和Guardrails时效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的双重越狱方法。

Method: 提出DualBreach框架，结合目标驱动初始化和多目标优化方法，动态构建提示并联合优化。

Result: DualBreach在多个数据集上表现优异，成功率达93.67%，且平均仅需1.77次查询。

Conclusion: DualBreach在双重越狱场景中显著优于现有方法，同时提出了防御机制EGuard以增强安全性。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on exploring the vulnerabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), aiming to elicit harmful and/or sensitive content from
LLMs. However, due to the insufficient research on dual-jailbreaking -- attacks
targeting both LLMs and Guardrails, the effectiveness of existing attacks is
limited when attempting to bypass safety-aligned LLMs shielded by guardrails.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose DualBreach, a target-driven framework for
dual-jailbreaking. DualBreach employs a Target-driven Initialization (TDI)
strategy to dynamically construct initial prompts, combined with a Multi-Target
Optimization (MTO) method that utilizes approximate gradients to jointly adapt
the prompts across guardrails and LLMs, which can simultaneously save the
number of queries and achieve a high dual-jailbreaking success rate. For
black-box guardrails, DualBreach either employs a powerful open-sourced
guardrail or imitates the target black-box guardrail by training a proxy model,
to incorporate guardrails into the MTO process.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of DualBreach in dual-jailbreaking scenarios
through extensive evaluation on several widely-used datasets. Experimental
results indicate that DualBreach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
fewer queries, achieving significantly higher success rates across all
settings. More specifically, DualBreach achieves an average dual-jailbreaking
success rate of 93.67% against GPT-4 with Llama-Guard-3 protection, whereas the
best success rate achieved by other methods is 88.33%. Moreover, DualBreach
only uses an average of 1.77 queries per successful dual-jailbreak,
outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. For the purpose of defense, we
propose an XGBoost-based ensemble defensive mechanism named EGuard, which
integrates the strengths of multiple guardrails, demonstrating superior
performance compared with Llama-Guard-3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型代理的自主复制能力对安全性的潜在风险。

Method: 开发RepliBench评估套件，分解为四个核心领域（获取资源、模型权重外泄、计算复制、持久化），包含20个任务家族的86个任务，并对5个前沿模型进行测试。

Result: 模型在云计算部署、自传播程序编写和简单安全设置下的模型权重外泄方面表现良好，但在KYC验证和持久化部署方面表现不佳。Claude 3.7 Sonnet在15/20任务家族中pass@10得分>50%。

Conclusion: 自主复制能力可能在不久的将来随着技术进步或人类辅助而出现。

Abstract: Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a
critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench,
a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities.
RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four
core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto
compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel
task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier
models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of
self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly.
Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write
self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security
setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent
deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50%
pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20
families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication
capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with
human assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDoS攻击对现代网络系统构成持续威胁，传统特征选择方法在复杂攻击环境中存在可扩展性和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 通过生成对抗网络（GAN）训练攻击流量数据，并利用判别器的扰动敏感性分析来无监督地评估特征重要性。

Result: 在CIC-DDoS2019数据集上的实验表明，GANFS提高了分类器准确性并显著降低了特征维度。

Conclusion: GANFS展示了将生成学习模型集成到网络安全管道中的潜力，可构建更具适应性和可扩展性的检测系统。

Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent and
evolving threat to modern networked systems, capable of causing large-scale
service disruptions. The complexity of such attacks, often hidden within
high-dimensional and redundant network traffic data, necessitates robust and
intelligent feature selection techniques for effective detection. Traditional
methods such as filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded approaches, each
offer strengths but struggle with scalability or adaptability in complex attack
environments. In this study, we explore these existing techniques through a
detailed comparative analysis and highlight their limitations when applied to
large-scale DDoS detection tasks. Building upon these insights, we introduce a
novel Generative Adversarial Network-based Feature Selection (GANFS) method
that leverages adversarial learning dynamics to identify the most informative
features. By training a GAN exclusively on attack traffic and employing a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis on the Discriminator, GANFS effectively
ranks feature importance without relying on full supervision. Experimental
evaluations using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset demonstrate that GANFS not only
improves the accuracy of downstream classifiers but also enhances computational
efficiency by significantly reducing feature dimensionality. These results
point to the potential of integrating generative learning models into
cybersecurity pipelines to build more adaptive and scalable detection systems.

Motivation: 医疗数据去标识化对保护患者隐私至关重要，但现有方法（规则和基于学习的方法）泛化性差且需要大量标注数据。LLM虽表现出色，但存在隐私风险和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出LPPA框架，通过本地微调LLM并使用合成笔记，确保隐私保护和高效的去标识化。

Result: 实验证明LPPA能准确去标识化私人信息，提供可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LPPA为临床笔记的去标识化提供了隐私保护强、准确性高的新方法。

Abstract: The de-identification of private information in medical data is a crucial
process to mitigate the risk of confidentiality breaches, particularly when
patient personal details are not adequately removed before the release of
medical records. Although rule-based and learning-based methods have been
proposed, they often struggle with limited generalizability and require
substantial amounts of annotated data for effective performance. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in
addressing these issues due to their superior language comprehension
capabilities. However, LLMs present challenges, including potential privacy
risks when using commercial LLM APIs and high computational costs for deploying
open-source LLMs locally. In this work, we introduce LPPA, an LLM-empowered
Privacy-Protected PHI Annotation framework for clinical notes, targeting the
English language. By fine-tuning LLMs locally with synthetic notes, LPPA
ensures strong privacy protection and high PHI annotation accuracy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate LPPA's effectiveness in accurately de-identifying
private information, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing
patient privacy protection.

Abstract: Web navigation AI agents use language-and-vision foundation models to enhance
productivity but these models are known to be susceptible to indirect prompt
injections that get them to follow instructions different from the legitimate
user's. Existing explorations of this threat applied to web agents often focus
on a single isolated adversarial goal, test with injected instructions that are
either too easy or not truly malicious, and often give the adversary
unreasonable access. In order to better focus adversarial research, we
construct a new benchmark called WASP (Web Agent Security against Prompt
injection attacks) that introduces realistic web agent hijacking objectives and
an isolated environment to test them in that does not affect real users or the
live web. As part of WASP, we also develop baseline attacks against three
popular web agentic systems (VisualWebArena, Claude Computer Use, and Operator)
instantiated with various state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation shows that
even AI agents backed by models with advanced reasoning capabilities and by
models with instruction hierarchy mitigations are susceptible to low-effort
human-written prompt injections. However, the realistic objectives in WASP also
allow us to observe that agents are currently not capable enough to complete
the goals of attackers end-to-end. Agents begin executing the adversarial
instruction between 16 and 86% of the time but only achieve the goal between 0
and 17% of the time. Based on these findings, we argue that adversarial
researchers should demonstrate stronger attacks that more consistently maintain
control over the agent given realistic constraints on the adversary's power.

Abstract: This paper explores the strategic use of modern synthetic data generation and
advanced data perturbation techniques to enhance security, maintain analytical

a particular focus on the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)

approaches.
  The goal is to create realistic, privacy-preserving datasets that retain high
utility for complex machine learning tasks and analytics, a critical need in
the data-sensitive industries like BFSI, Healthcare, Retail, and
Telecommunications. We discuss how these modern techniques potentially offer
significant improvements in balancing privacy preservation while maintaining
data utility compared to older methods. Furthermore, we examine the potential
for operational gains, such as reduced overhead and accelerated analytics, by
using these privacy-enhanced datasets. We also explore key use cases where
these methods can mitigate regulatory risks and enable scalable, data-driven
innovation without compromising sensitive customer information.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于MoE架构的大型语言模型（LLM）的后门攻击，提出了BadMoE攻击方法，通过毒化休眠专家并优化路由触发器来控制模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构在LLM中表现出高效扩展模型容量的能力，但其安全漏洞尚未充分研究，尤其是后门攻击的可能性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过识别与目标任务无关的休眠专家，构建路由感知损失优化激活触发器，并通过毒化数据提升休眠专家的主导地位。

Result: 证明了MoE模型中存在少数主导专家，其输出可决定整体模型行为，并展示了休眠专家如何被操纵为支配性专家。

Conclusion: BadMoE攻击成功利用了MoE架构的独特性，揭示了其潜在安全风险，为未来防御研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have emerged as a powerful architecture for
  large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient scaling of model capacity
  while maintaining manageable computational costs. The key advantage lies in
  their ability to route different tokens to different ``expert'' networks
  within the model, enabling specialization and efficient handling of diverse
  input. However, the vulnerabilities of MoE-based LLMs still have barely been
  studied, and the potential for backdoor attacks in this context remains
  largely unexplored. This paper presents the first backdoor attack against
  MoE-based LLMs where the attackers poison ``dormant experts'' (i.e.,
underutilized
  experts) and activate them by optimizing routing triggers, thereby gaining
  control over the model's output. We first rigorously prove the existence of a
few ``dominating
  experts'' in MoE models, whose outputs can determine the overall MoE's
  output. We also show that dormant experts can serve as dominating experts to
manipulate model predictions.
  Accordingly, our attack, namely \textsc{BadMoE}, exploits the unique
  architecture of MoE models by 1) identifying dormant experts unrelated to the
target task, 2)
  constructing a routing-aware loss to optimize the activation triggers of
these experts, and 3) promoting dormant experts to dominating roles via
poisoned training data.

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent an increasingly sophisticated and pervasive threat
to individuals and organizations, causing significant financial losses,
identity theft, and severe damage to institutional reputations. Existing
phishing detection methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high
accuracy and explainability, either failing to detect novel attacks or
operating as opaque black-box models. To address this critical gap, we propose
a novel phishing URL detection system based on a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang
(TSK) fuzzy inference model optimized through gradient-based techniques. Our
approach intelligently combines the interpretability and human-like reasoning
capabilities of fuzzy logic with the precision and adaptability provided by
gradient optimization methods, specifically leveraging the Adam optimizer for
efficient parameter tuning. Experiments conducted using a comprehensive dataset
of over 235,000 URLs demonstrate rapid convergence, exceptional predictive
performance (accuracy averaging 99.95% across 5 cross-validation folds, with a
perfect AUC i.e. 1.00). Furthermore, optimized fuzzy rules and membership
functions improve interoperability, clearly indicating how the model makes
decisions - an essential feature for cybersecurity applications. This
high-performance, transparent, and interpretable phishing detection framework
significantly advances current cybersecurity defenses, providing practitioners
with accurate and explainable decision-making tools.

connectivity and enabling autonomous driving. However, this increased
interconnectivity introduces new security vulnerabilities. Bot malware and
cyberattacks pose significant risks to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
(CAVs), as demonstrated by real-world incidents involving remote vehicle system
compromise. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-based Intrusion
Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic to and from CAVs. Our
detection model is based on a meta-ensemble classifier capable of recognizing
known (Nday) attacks and detecting previously unseen (zero-day) attacks. The
approach involves training multiple Isolation Forest (IF) models on
Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers, with each IF specialized in
identifying a specific type of botnet attack. These IFs, either trained locally
or shared by other MEC nodes, are then aggregated using a Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) based stacking strategy to construct a robust
meta-classifier. The proposed IDS has been evaluated on a vehicular botnet
dataset, achieving an average detection rate of 92.80% for N-day attacks and
77.32% for zero-day attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
solution in detecting both known and emerging threats, providing a scalable and
adaptive defense mechanism for CAVs within the IoV ecosystem.

### [268] [Residual-Evasive Attacks on ADMM in Distributed Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18570)
*Sabrina Bruckmeier,Huadong Mo,James Qin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出两种攻击策略，通过避免残差显著变化来规避ADMM系统的检测，展示了其隐蔽性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测算法通常通过残差变化识别虚假数据注入，但攻击者可以通过保持残差不变来规避检测。

Method: 第一种策略结合随机起点和Gram-Schmidt正交化确保隐蔽性；第二种策略在此基础上以财务收益为目标，操纵无功功率并利用系统运行约束。

Result: 在IEEE 14-bus系统上的案例研究表明，两种策略在隐蔽性和破坏性上优于常见攻击方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ADMM系统的漏洞，强调需要更鲁棒的监测算法以应对高级攻击策略。

Abstract: This paper presents two attack strategies designed to evade detection in
ADMM-based systems by preventing significant changes to the residual during the
attacked iteration. While many detection algorithms focus on identifying false
data injection through residual changes, we show that our attacks remain
undetected by keeping the residual largely unchanged. The first strategy uses a
random starting point combined with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure
stealth, with potential for refinement by enhancing the orthogonal component to
increase system disruption. The second strategy builds on the first, targeting
financial gains by manipulating reactive power and pushing the system to its
upper voltage limit, exploiting operational constraints. The effectiveness of
the proposed attack-resilient mechanism is demonstrated through case studies on
the IEEE 14-bus system. A comparison of the two strategies, along with commonly
used naive attacks, reveals trade-offs between simplicity, detectability, and
effectiveness, providing insights into ADMM system vulnerabilities. These
findings underscore the need for more robust monitoring algorithms to protect
against advanced attack strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居中物联网设备的快速扩展带来了安全和隐私问题，现有解决方案依赖云端检测或过时的白名单，效果不佳。

Method: 通过分析设备网络行为，构建标记数据集并利用机器学习分类网络目的地，区分必要与非必要流量。

Result: 在五种智能家居设备测试中，模型能准确识别并阻止非必要流量，包括未知目的地，且无需传统白名单。

Conclusion: ML-IoTrim为智能家居隐私保护提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持大规模物联网环境中的实时流量分类。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in
smart home environments, has introduced considerable security and privacy
concerns due to their persistent connectivity and interaction with cloud
services. Despite advancements in IoT security, effective privacy measures
remain uncovered, with existing solutions often relying on cloud-based threat
detection that exposes sensitive data or outdated allow-lists that inadequately
restrict non-essential network traffic. This work presents ML-IoTrim, a system
for detecting and mitigating non-essential IoT traffic (i.e., not influencing
the device operations) by analyzing network behavior at the edge, leveraging
Machine Learning to classify network destinations. Our approach includes
building a labeled dataset based on IoT device behavior and employing a
feature-extraction pipeline to enable a binary classification of essential vs.
non-essential network destinations. We test our framework in a consumer smart
home setup with IoT devices from five categories, demonstrating that the model
can accurately identify and block non-essential traffic, including previously
unseen destinations, without relying on traditional allow-lists. We implement
our solution on a home access point, showing the framework has strong potential
for scalable deployment, supporting near-real-time traffic classification in
large-scale IoT environments with hundreds of devices. This research advances
privacy-aware traffic control in smart homes, paving the way for future
developments in IoT device privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学和编码方面表现出色，但其在需要密码学专业知识的领域中的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: CipherBank包含2,358个精心设计的问题，涵盖5个领域和14个子领域的262个独特明文，涉及3大类9种加密方法。

Result: 评估发现，通用聊天模型与专注于推理的模型之间存在显著差距，且在经典密码解密任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
especially the recent advancements in reasoning, such as o1 and o3, pushing the
boundaries of AI. Despite these impressive achievements in mathematics and
coding, the reasoning abilities of LLMs in domains requiring cryptographic
expertise remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CipherBank, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
in cryptographic decryption tasks. CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously
crafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14
subdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that
necessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank
incorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct
algorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques.
We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on CipherBank, e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and
cutting-edge reasoning-focused models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Our results
reveal significant gaps in reasoning abilities not only between general-purpose
chat LLMs and reasoning-focused LLMs but also in the performance of current
reasoning-focused models when applied to classical cryptographic decryption
tasks, highlighting the challenges these models face in understanding and
manipulating encrypted data. Through detailed analysis and error
investigations, we provide several key observations that shed light on the
limitations and potential improvement areas for LLMs in cryptographic
reasoning. These findings underscore the need for continuous advancements in
LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of agentic multi-modal large reasoning models,
such as ChatGPT o3, have raised critical concerns regarding privacy leakage
through inadvertent image geolocation. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic and controlled study on the potential privacy risks associated with
visual reasoning abilities of ChatGPT o3. We manually collect and construct a
dataset comprising 50 real-world images that feature individuals alongside
privacy-relevant environmental elements, capturing realistic and sensitive
scenarios for analysis. Our experimental evaluation reveals that ChatGPT o3 can
predict user locations with high precision, achieving street-level accuracy
(within one mile) in 60% of cases. Through analysis, we identify key visual
cues, including street layout and front yard design, that significantly
contribute to the model inference success. Additionally, targeted occlusion
experiments demonstrate that masking critical features effectively mitigates
geolocation accuracy, providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. Our
findings highlight an urgent need for privacy-aware development for agentic
multi-modal large reasoning models, particularly in applications involving
private imagery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SAGE框架，用于动态和定制化的LLM安全评估，发现对话长度增加会加剧危害，且模型行为因用户个性和场景而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估方法难以适应快速发展的应用需求，缺乏动态性和针对性，可能导致潜在危害被忽视。

Method: 引入SAGE框架，采用模块化设计和对抗性用户模型，进行多轮对话评估。

Result: 实验发现对话长度增加会导致危害上升，模型行为因用户个性和场景差异显著，部分模型通过过度拒绝策略减少危害但影响实用性。

Conclusion: 需采用自适应和上下文相关的测试方法，以确保LLM在实际应用中的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made progress and
attracted academic interest, but it remains challenging to keep pace with the
rapid integration of LLMs across diverse applications. Different applications
expose users to various harms, necessitating application-specific safety
evaluations with tailored harms and policies. Another major gap is the lack of
focus on the dynamic and conversational nature of LLM systems. Such potential
oversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks.
This paper identifies the above as key requirements for robust LLM safety
evaluation and recognizing that current evaluation methodologies do not satisfy
these, we introduce the $\texttt{SAGE}$ (Safety AI Generic Evaluation)
framework. $\texttt{SAGE}$ is an automated modular framework designed for
customized and dynamic harm evaluations. It utilizes adversarial user models
that are system-aware and have unique personalities, enabling a holistic
red-teaming evaluation. We demonstrate $\texttt{SAGE}$'s effectiveness by
evaluating seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm
policies. Our experiments with multi-turn conversational evaluations revealed a
concerning finding that harm steadily increases with conversation length.
Furthermore, we observe significant disparities in model behavior when exposed
to different user personalities and scenarios. Our findings also reveal that
some models minimize harmful outputs by employing severe refusal tactics that
can hinder their usefulness. These insights highlight the necessity of adaptive
and context-specific testing to ensure better safety alignment and safer
deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI多智能体系统的兴起，标准化协议的需求增加，但同时也带来了工具抢占等安全挑战。本文旨在解决这一关键安全问题。

Method: 提出了一种工具注册系统，包括管理员控制的注册、集中式工具发现、细粒度访问策略、动态信任评分机制和即时凭证供应。

Result: 该框架有效预防了工具抢占的常见攻击向量，同时保持了多智能体系统的灵活性和功能。

Conclusion: 本文填补了生成式AI生态系统中的安全空白，为生产环境中的安全工具集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) multi-agent systems (MAS) necessitates
standardized protocols enabling agents to discover and interact with external
tools. However, these protocols introduce new security challenges,
particularly; tool squatting; the deceptive registration or representation of
tools. This paper analyzes tool squatting threats within the context of
emerging interoperability standards, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) or
seamless communication between agents protocols. It introduces a comprehensive
Tool Registry system designed to mitigate these risks. We propose a
security-focused architecture featuring admin-controlled registration,
centralized tool discovery, fine grained access policies enforced via dedicated
Agent and Tool Registry services, a dynamic trust scoring mechanism based on
tool versioning and known vulnerabilities, and just in time credential
provisioning. Based on its design principles, the proposed registry framework
aims to effectively prevent common tool squatting vectors while preserving the
flexibility and power of multi-agent systems. This work addresses a critical
security gap in the rapidly evolving GenAI ecosystem and provides a foundation
for secure tool integration in production environments.

Result: 研究识别了9种主要威胁，分布在五个关键领域，并提出了针对性的解决方案。

Conclusion: 生成式AI代理需要全新的安全视角，现有的威胁模型和防御措施需适应其独特架构和行为，以避免其成为企业的潜在风险。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) agents become more common in enterprise settings,
they introduce security challenges that differ significantly from those posed
by traditional systems. These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember,
and act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a
comprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on
how their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool
integration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats
and organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture
vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution
vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These
threats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as
delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral
movement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing
frameworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work
present two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for
Autonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a
framework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce
enterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI
security, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those
differences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require
a new lens for security. If we fail to adapt our threat models and defenses to
account for their unique architecture and behavior, we risk turning a powerful
new tool into a serious enterprise liability.

TL;DR: SORT3D是一种利用2D数据中的丰富对象属性，结合启发式空间推理工具箱和大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，用于解决3D场景中对象引用和语言理解的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D场景中，由于场景多样性、细粒度对象数量多以及语言引用的复杂性，机器人理解对象引用语言并定位对象具有挑战性。同时，获取大量自然语言训练数据困难。

Method: SORT3D结合2D数据的对象属性和启发式空间推理工具箱，利用LLMs进行序列推理，无需文本到3D数据的训练。

Result: SORT3D在两个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并在真实世界的自动驾驶车辆上实时运行，展示了其在新环境中的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: SORT3D通过结合2D数据和LLMs，有效解决了3D场景中的对象引用问题，并展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with
spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside
humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,
large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language
references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural
language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn
from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these
challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes
from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the
ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.
Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can
be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two
benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous
vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal
navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for
the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D .

Abstract: Video summarization creates an abridged version (i.e., a summary) that
provides a quick overview of the video while retaining pertinent information.
In this work, we focus on summarizing instructional videos and propose a method
for breaking down a video into meaningful segments, each corresponding to
essential steps in the video. We propose \textbf{HierSum}, a hierarchical
approach that integrates fine-grained local cues from subtitles with global
contextual information provided by video-level instructions. Our approach
utilizes the ``most replayed" statistic as a supervisory signal to identify
critical segments, thereby improving the effectiveness of the summary. We
evaluate on benchmark datasets such as TVSum, BLiSS, Mr.HiSum, and the WikiHow
test set, and show that HierSum consistently outperforms existing methods in
key metrics such as F1-score and rank correlation. We also curate a new
multi-modal dataset using WikiHow and EHow videos and associated articles
containing step-by-step instructions. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that training on this dataset significantly enhances summarization
on the target datasets.

main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining
the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image
synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object
generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical
deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of transformer models in NLP, and
image and video classification, the available tools for extracting features
from captured IoT network flow packets fail to capture sequential patterns in
addition to the absence of spatial patterns consequently limiting transformer
model application. This work introduces a novel preprocessing method to adapt
transformer models, the vision transformer (ViT) in particular, for IoT botnet
attack detection using network flow packets. The approach involves feature
extraction from .pcap files and transforming each instance into a 1-channel 2D
image shape, enabling ViT-based classification. Also, the ViT model was
enhanced to allow use any classifier besides Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that
was deployed in the initial ViT paper. Models including the conventional feed
forward Deep Neural Network (DNN), LSTM and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM)
demonstrated competitive performance in terms of precision, recall, and
F1-score for multiclass-based attack detection when evaluated on two IoT attack

Conclusion: 多视角视频输入和完整序列训练能显著提升超声心动图自动解读的准确性。

Abstract: Echocardiography involves recording videos of the heart using ultrasound,
enabling clinicians to evaluate its condition. Recent advances in large-scale
vision-language models (VLMs) have garnered attention for automating the
interpretation of echocardiographic videos. However, most existing VLMs
proposed for medical interpretation thus far rely on single-frame (i.e., image)
inputs. Consequently, these image-based models often exhibit lower diagnostic
accuracy for conditions identifiable through cardiac motion. Moreover,
echocardiographic videos are recorded from various views that depend on the
direction of ultrasound emission, and certain views are more suitable than
others for interpreting specific conditions. Incorporating multiple views could
potentially yield further improvements in accuracy. In this study, we developed
a video-language model that takes five different views and full video sequences
as input, training it on pairs of echocardiographic videos and clinical reports
from 60,747 cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this expanded approach
achieves higher interpretation accuracy than models trained with only
single-view videos or with still images.

intelligence, as it enables embodied agents to interpret and interact
dynamically within real-world environments. This paper introduces MPEC, a novel
Masked Point-Entity Contrastive learning method for open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation that leverages both 3D entity-language alignment and point-entity
consistency across different point cloud views to foster entity-specific
feature representations. Our method improves semantic discrimination and

Result: 实验表明，该方法在说话人脸视频生成中实现了更高的保真度和音频-唇同步效果。

Conclusion: JULNet通过联合学习误差和不确定性，显著提升了生成视频的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Talking face video generation with arbitrary speech audio is a significant
challenge within the realm of digital human technology. The previous studies
have emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual
quality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual
uncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including
inconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input
conditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning
Network (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which
incorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual
error. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually
predict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.
The error map represents the difference between the generated image and the
ground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the
probability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty
distribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we
introduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly
optimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model
can be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video
generation compared to previous methods.

Abstract: 3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions
tailored to the limits and characteristics of the different application
scenarios. In this study, we investigate how multiple state-of-the-art 3DFR
algorithms can be used to generate a better representation of subjects, with
the final goal of improving the performance of face recognition systems in
challenging uncontrolled scenarios. We also explore how different parametric
and non-parametric score-level fusion methods can exploit the unique strengths
of multiple 3DFR algorithms to enhance biometric recognition robustness. With
this goal, we propose a comprehensive analysis of several face recognition
systems across diverse conditions, such as varying distances and camera setups,
intra-dataset and cross-dataset, to assess the robustness of the proposed
ensemble method. The results demonstrate that the distinct information provided
by different 3DFR algorithms can alleviate the problem of generalizing over
multiple application scenarios. In addition, the present study highlights the
potential of advanced fusion strategies to enhance the reliability of
3DFR-based face recognition systems, providing the research community with key
insights to exploit them in real-world applications effectively. Although the
experiments are carried out in a specific face verification setup, our proposed
fusion-based 3DFR methods may be applied to other tasks around face biometrics
that are not strictly related to identity recognition.

often independently model channel importance and spatial saliency, overlooking
their inherent interdependence and limiting their effectiveness. To address
this limitation, we propose MIA-Mind, a lightweight and modular
Multidimensional Interactive Attention Mechanism, built upon the MindSpore
framework. MIA-Mind jointly models spatial and channel features through a

accuracy of 82.9\%; on ISBI2012, it achieves an accuracy of 78.7\%; and on
CIC-IDS2017, it achieves an accuracy of 91.9\%. These results validate the
versatility, lightweight design, and generalization ability of MIA-Mind across
heterogeneous tasks. Future work will explore the extension of MIA-Mind to
large-scale datasets, the development of ada,ptive attention fusion strategies,

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PAD的频率感知框架，通过解耦相位和振幅分量，解决SAR与RGB图像融合中的模态异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR与RGB图像融合因模态异质性和光谱互补性利用不足而具有挑战性，现有方法难以分离共享结构和模态特定特征。

Method: PAD框架包含相位谱校正（PSC）和振幅谱融合（ASF），前者增强几何一致性，后者动态整合高低频细节。

Result: 在WHU-OPT-SAR和DDHR-SK数据集上表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PAD为物理感知的多模态融合提供了新范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover
classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and the
underutilization of spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to
decouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric
attributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this
issue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework
that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific)
components in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key
components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase
features through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency,
and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates
high-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive
multilayer perceptrons. This approach leverages SAR's sensitivity to
morphological features and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on
WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our
work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote
sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展，尤其是基于指令的图像编辑，对数字图像的完整性构成威胁，现有检测系统难以察觉此类编辑，亟需更强大的防御手段。

Method: 提出CapsFake网络，通过多模态（视觉、文本、频域）的低级胶囊和竞争路由机制，动态聚合局部特征以精确识别篡改区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，CapsFake的检测准确率比现有方法高20%，在自然扰动和对抗攻击下分别达到94%和96%的检测率，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: CapsFake为对抗复杂图像篡改提供了强大框架，显著提升了检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake technology, particularly in
instruction-guided image editing, threatens the integrity of digital images by
enabling subtle, context-aware manipulations. Generated conditionally from real
images and textual prompts, these edits are often imperceptible to both humans
and existing detection systems, revealing significant limitations in current
defenses. We propose a novel multimodal capsule network, CapsFake, designed to
detect such deepfake image edits by integrating low-level capsules from visual,
textual, and frequency-domain modalities. High-level capsules, predicted
through a competitive routing mechanism, dynamically aggregate local features
to identify manipulated regions with precision. Evaluated on diverse datasets,
including MagicBrush, Unsplash Edits, Open Images Edits, and Multi-turn Edits,
CapsFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 20% in detection
accuracy. Ablation studies validate its robustness, achieving detection rates
above 94% under natural perturbations and 96% against adversarial attacks, with
excellent generalization to unseen editing scenarios. This approach establishes
a powerful framework for countering sophisticated image manipulations.

Motivation: 光谱成像在不同领域应用广泛，但相机间的通道维度和波长差异限制了AI模型的通用性和跨相机适用性。

Method: 引入波长位置编码和自注意力-交叉注意力机制，将光谱信息压缩为学习到的查询表示，并通过自监督JEPA策略进行光谱-空间预训练。

Result: 在医学影像、自动驾驶和卫星成像等领域的大规模实验中，CARL表现出对光谱异质性的独特鲁棒性，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CARL的扩展性和多功能性使其成为未来光谱基础模型的骨干。

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains,
including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as
a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel
dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the
development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with
limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address
this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for
$\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation
$\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging
modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel
dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength
positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress
spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial
pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired
strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our
model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets
with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability
and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for
future spectral foundation models.

Motivation: 随着Transformer模型的数据和参数规模扩大，性能提升逐渐减少，而训练成本却显著增加。因此，需要更高效的微调和推理方法，尤其是在多模态学习中，推理成本直接影响模型的实用性。

Method: 基于对预训练模型内部机制的理解，特别是深层模态间的隐式对齐，作者提出了一种简单的多模态框架改进方法。

Result: 该方法不仅保持了基线方法的性能，在某些情况下还提升了性能，同时显著减少了训练和推理时的计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究为高效整合预训练模型提供了新思路，同时展示了隐式对齐在多模态学习中的潜力。

Abstract: The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is
yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against
training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more
efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This
is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs
of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability.
At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability
has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based
models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper
layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this,
we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks
that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach
maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods
while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute.
Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger
systems efficiently.

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升了公平性，同时保持了全局准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决人脸识别系统的公平性问题提供了一种有效且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the
research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally
accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate
mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender,
ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain
Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population
compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by
regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging
problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance
measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the
huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training.
In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the
fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on
centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we
present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain
in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.

Method: 提出双分支残差网络，并行提取空间和光谱特征；引入正则项优化原型质量；采用核概率匹配策略对齐源域和目标域特征。

Result: 在四个公开高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了小样本高光谱图像分类的性能和跨数据集适应性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective for hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, but their 3D convolutional structures introduce high
computational costs and limited generalization in few-shot scenarios. Domain
shifts caused by sensor differences and environmental variations further hinder
cross-dataset adaptability. Metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) prototype
networks mitigate this problem, yet their performance is sensitive to prototype
quality, especially with limited samples. To overcome these challenges, a
dual-branch residual network that integrates spatial and spectral features via
parallel branches is proposed in this letter. Additionally, more robust refined
prototypes are obtained through a regulation term. Furthermore, a kernel
probability matching strategy aligns source and target domain features,
alleviating domain shift. Experiments on four publicly available HSI datasets
illustrate that the proposal achieves superior performance compared to other
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像和地图的双向翻译在规划和灾害响应中有重要应用，但缺乏精确对齐和高抽象合成能力。

Method: 采用地理坐标嵌入和多尺度特征对齐（GJSA），结合语义注入（SI）和关键点自适应引导（KPAG）机制。

Result: 在CNSatMap和纽约数据集上表现优异，视觉真实性和语义一致性显著提升，支持零样本任务。

Conclusion: EarthMapper在双向翻译任务中表现出色，具有多功能性和高适应性。

Abstract: Satellite imagery and maps, as two fundamental data modalities in remote
sensing, offer direct observations of the Earth's surface and
human-interpretable geographic abstractions, respectively. The task of
bidirectional translation between satellite images and maps (BSMT) holds
significant potential for applications in urban planning and disaster response.
However, this task presents two major challenges: first, the absence of precise
pixel-wise alignment between the two modalities substantially complicates the
translation process; second, it requires achieving both high-level abstraction
of geographic features and high-quality visual synthesis, which further
elevates the technical complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce
EarthMapper, a novel autoregressive framework for controllable bidirectional
satellite-map translation. EarthMapper employs geographic coordinate embeddings
to anchor generation, ensuring region-specific adaptability, and leverages
multi-scale feature alignment within a geo-conditioned joint scale
autoregression (GJSA) process to unify bidirectional translation in a single
training cycle. A semantic infusion (SI) mechanism is introduced to enhance
feature-level consistency, while a key point adaptive guidance (KPAG) mechanism
is proposed to dynamically balance diversity and precision during inference. We
further contribute CNSatMap, a large-scale dataset comprising 302,132 precisely
aligned satellite-map pairs across 38 Chinese cities, enabling robust
benchmarking. Extensive experiments on CNSatMap and the New York dataset
demonstrate EarthMapper's superior performance, achieving significant
improvements in visual realism, semantic consistency, and structural fidelity
over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, EarthMapper excels in zero-shot
tasks like in-painting, out-painting and coordinate-conditional generation,
underscoring its versatility.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a universal chronic musculoskeletal disorders
worldwide, making early diagnosis crucial. Currently, the Kellgren and Lawrence
(KL) grading system is widely used to assess KOA severity. However, its high
inter-observer variability and subjectivity hinder diagnostic consistency. To
address these limitations, automated diagnostic techniques using deep learning
have been actively explored in recent years. In this study, we propose a
CLIP-based framework (CLIP-KOA) to enhance the consistency and reliability of
KOA grade prediction. To achieve this, we introduce a learning approach that
integrates image and text information and incorporate Symmetry Loss and
Consistency Loss to ensure prediction consistency between the original and
flipped images. CLIP-KOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 71.86\% on KOA
severity prediction task, and ablation studies show that CLIP-KOA has 2.36\%
improvement in accuracy over the standard CLIP model due to our contribution.
This study shows a novel direction for data-driven medical prediction not only
to improve reliability of fine-grained diagnosis and but also to explore
multimodal methods for medical image analysis. Our code is available at

Abstract: Quad meshes are essential in geometric modeling and computational mechanics.
Although learning-based methods for triangle mesh demonstrate considerable
advancements, quad mesh generation remains less explored due to the challenge
of ensuring coplanarity, convexity, and quad-only meshes. In this paper, we
present Point2Quad, the first learning-based method for quad-only mesh
generation from point clouds. The key idea is learning to identify quad mesh
with fused pointwise and facewise features. Specifically, Point2Quad begins
with a k-NN-based candidate generation considering the coplanarity and
squareness. Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and
topological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints,
especially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics.
Subsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a
designed compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a
quad-specific post-processing. Extensive experiments on both clear and noise
data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of Point2Quad, compared to
baseline methods under comprehensive metrics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a concept of neural network specialization via
task-specific domain constraining, aimed at enhancing network performance on
data subspace in which the network operates. The study presents experiments on
training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The
results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy
even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by
constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and
experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying
traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically
coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is
proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the
evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to
future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image
analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input.
Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in
scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of
the generalist network.

### [299] [Lightweight Adapter Learning for More Generalized Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19598)
*Dou Quan,Rufan Zhou,Shuang Wang,Ning Huyan,Dong Zhao,Yunan Li,Licheng Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的变化检测网络（CANet），通过共享模块和轻量级适配器解决数据集间的分布和标注差异，提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常针对单一数据集训练，泛化能力差。本文旨在设计一种通用且高效的变化检测方法。

Method: CANet包含共享学习模块和轻量级适配器，后者通过变化区域掩码（ICM）和数据集特定的批归一化层处理数据差异。

Result: CANet在多个数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，训练成本低（仅更新4.1%-7.7%参数），且在小样本下性能优越。

Conclusion: CANet是一种高效、通用的变化检测方法，可灵活嵌入现有模型，显著提升了泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing
image change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a
dataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant
differences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the
trained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on
other datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter
network (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains
dataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the
discriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter
model, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data
distribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the
deep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this
paper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which
can adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of
labeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch
normalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution
differences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve
satisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental
results on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and
advantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization
ability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and
better performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning
methods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDPM虽然能生成高质量图像，但未充分利用相邻像素的关联性，HDM旨在通过热方程保留更多细节。

Method: HDM将二维热方程的离散形式融入DDPM的扩散和生成公式，计算相邻像素关系。

Result: 实验表明，HDM生成的图像质量优于DDPM、CDM、LDM和VQGAN等模型。

Conclusion: HDM通过热方程优化像素关系，显著提升了图像生成的真实性和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve high-quality image
generation without adversarial training, but they process images as a whole.
Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we
propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and
generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level
operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the
discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the
diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute
relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our
experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared
to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion
Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

Conclusion: Seg2HOI能够生成未训练过的文本和视觉提示的四元组和交互分割，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Segmentation to Human-Object Interaction
(\textit{\textbf{Seg2HOI}}) approach, a novel framework that integrates
segmentation-based vision foundation models with the human-object interaction
task, distinguished from traditional detection-based Human-Object Interaction
(HOI) methods. Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the
standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets
by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically,
Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g.,
promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies
these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional
training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such
features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that
Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from
novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it
versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.

Motivation: 分析乒乓球运动员技术需要球的3D轨迹和旋转信息，但旋转无法直接从标准广播视频中观测到。

Method: 通过球的2D轨迹推断初始旋转和3D轨迹，仅使用合成数据训练神经网络，并结合物理正确的数据表示和针对性增强。

Result: 方法在旋转分类上达到92.0%准确率，2D重投影误差为0.19%图像对角线。

Conclusion: 仅用合成数据和简单技术即可实现泛化，无需真实数据训练，首次在单目广播视频中实现旋转和轨迹预测。

Abstract: Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the
ball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in
standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's
trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin
and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without
ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on
synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically
correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network
naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are
sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for
training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method
for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos,
achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection
error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.

Motivation: 乳腺癌的早期诊断需要高精度检测，多视图数据能提供更全面的信息，但现有方法在处理高分辨率数据时存在挑战。

Method: 预训练单视图分类模型，通过提示调优技术引入多视图特征学习，仅调优7%的参数，避免激进下采样。

Result: 在大型多机构数据集上，MVPT-NET的AUROC达到0.852，优于传统方法，且保持高效检测。

Conclusion: MVPT-NET为医学影像任务提供了可扩展的多视图数据集成方案，展示了其在乳腺癌检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is
crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies
have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer
detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more
comprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical
imaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with
large-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view
Visual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening
mammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on
high-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature
learning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively
tunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\%) while retaining the
robustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration
of multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach
offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods,
providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution
mammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while
maintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for
distinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights
the potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable
solution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection.

Motivation: 尽管GNN在视觉任务中表现出高效性，但其可解释性尚未充分探索，而图结构天然具有可解释性。

Method: 通过量化层间图的语义相似性和空间一致性，并结合标准与对抗性设置下的解释，评估模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，模型的决策过程可以有效解释，但其深层推理与人类感知不完全一致。

Conclusion: GNN模型的可解释性可通过语义分析和可视化技术实现，但需注意其与人类感知的差异。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to
convolutional approaches for vision tasks such as image classification,
leveraging patch-based representations instead of raw pixels. These methods
construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established
based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their
efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains
underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we
analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of
GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object
structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented
by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect
semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and
adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the
classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information
across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby
highlighting the models' explainability. Our findings demonstrate that the
decision-making processes of these models can be effectively explained, while
also revealing that their reasoning does not necessarily align with human
perception, especially in deeper layers.

Conclusion: 结合域适应和高效对比学习可构建实用的资源高效天气分类系统。

Abstract: Accurate weather classification from low-quality traffic camera imagery
remains a challenging task, particularly under adverse nighttime conditions. In
this study, we propose a scalable framework that combines generative domain
adaptation with efficient contrastive learning to enhance classification
performance. Using CycleGAN-based domain translation, we improve the quality of
nighttime images, enabling better feature extraction by downstream models.
While the baseline EVA-02 model employing CLIP-based contrastive loss achieves
an overall accuracy of 96.55\%, it exhibits a significant performance gap
between daytime (97.21\%) and nighttime conditions (63.40\%). Replacing CLIP
with the lightweight SigLIP-2 (Sigmoid contrastive loss) achieves a competitive
overall accuracy of 94.00\%, with substantial improvements in nighttime
performance (85.90\% accuracy). The combination of Vision-SigLIP-2,
Text-SigLIP-2, CycleGAN, and contrastive training achieves the best nighttime
accuracy (85.90\%) among all models tested, while EVA-02 with CycleGAN
maintains the highest overall accuracy (97.01\%) and per-class accuracies.
These findings demonstrate the potential of combining domain adaptation and
efficient contrastive learning to build practical, resource-efficient weather
classification systems for intelligent transportation infrastructure.

Abstract: The automatic summarization of surgical videos is essential for enhancing
procedural documentation, supporting surgical training, and facilitating
post-operative analysis. This paper presents a novel method at the intersection
of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning
models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a
multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and
large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach
is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into
clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual
transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and
surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into
frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with
temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level
summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the
clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a
dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on
the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50
laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\%
precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context
summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools
for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable
clinical documentation.

Abstract: Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity,
as weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water.
Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to
assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity,
and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However,
monitoring weed management methods is challenging as commonly rely on on-ground
field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In
order to tackle this problem, we leverage Earth Observation (EO) data and
Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed an ML approach for mapping
four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and
No practice) in orchards using satellite image time series (SITS) data from two
different sources: Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS). The findings
demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency
and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.

Abstract: We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture
that jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields
with view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the
recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art
sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to
reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or
generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics
engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical
contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework.
First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more
input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane
neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and
material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding
mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and
material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model
achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based
dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting
accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.

Abstract: This study enhances Monte Carlo simulation accuracy in X-ray imaging by
developing an AI-driven model for the anode heel effect, achieving improved
beam intensity distribution and dosimetric precision. Through dynamic
adjustments to beam weights on the anode and cathode sides of the X-ray tube,
our machine learning model effectively replicates the asymmetry characteristic
of clinical X-ray beams. Experimental results reveal dose rate increases of up
to 9.6% on the cathode side and reductions of up to 12.5% on the anode side,
for energy levels between 50 and 120 kVp. These experimentally optimized beam
weights were integrated into the OpenGATE and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits,
significantly advancing dosimetric simulation accuracy and the image quality
which closely resembles the clinical imaging. Validation with fluence and dose
actors demonstrated that the AI-based model closely mirrors clinical beam
behavior, providing substantial improvements in dose consistency and accuracy
over conventional X-ray models. This approach provides a robust framework for
improving X-ray dosimetry, with potential applications in dose optimization,
imaging quality enhancement, and radiation safety in both clinical and research
settings.

TL;DR: SI-CLAD是一种新的统计框架，用于测试基于聚类的异常检测结果，能够严格控制误报率，并通过选择性推断提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于聚类的异常检测方法缺乏对检测结果可靠性的保证，SI-CLAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用选择性推断框架分析聚类AD的选择机制，控制误报率并提升真检测率。

Result: 实验证明SI-CLAD能够有效控制误报率并提升检测性能。

Conclusion: SI-CLAD为基于聚类的异常检测提供了统计可靠性保证，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning and statistics. A popular approach to unsupervised AD is
clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee
the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD
(Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel
statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key
strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability
of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a pre-specified
significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$). By analyzing the selection
mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the Selective
Inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable.
Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing
the overall performance of SI-CLAD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for our theoretical
findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints
is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications.
However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement
learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety,
exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations
for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem
of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics.
We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must
with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe
algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the
regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a
natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for
safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new
baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal
controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever
the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our
controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最小二乘估计在非高斯噪声下表现不佳，残差常呈现非正态分布特性，因此需要探索基于其他范数的估计方法。

Method: 提出局部多项式$L_p$-范数回归，用加权$L_p$-范数估计替代加权最小二乘估计，并引入新的参数$p$估计方法。

Result: 数值和理论研究表明，该方法在一维数据中优于局部最小二乘，并在二维数据中展现出潜力。

Conclusion: $L_p$-范数回归方法在非高斯噪声环境下具有更好的适应性和性能。

Abstract: The local least squares estimator for a regression curve cannot provide
optimal results when non-Gaussian noise is present. Both theoretical and
empirical evidence suggests that residuals often exhibit distributional
properties different from those of a normal distribution, making it worthwhile
to consider estimation based on other norms. It is suggested that $L_p$-norm
estimators be used to minimize the residuals when these exhibit non-normal
kurtosis. In this paper, we propose a local polynomial $L_p$-norm regression
that replaces weighted least squares estimation with weighted $L_p$-norm
estimation for fitting the polynomial locally. We also introduce a new method
for estimating the parameter $p$ from the residuals, enhancing the adaptability
of the approach. Through numerical and theoretical investigation, we
demonstrate our method's superiority over local least squares in
one-dimensional data and show promising outcomes for higher dimensions,
specifically in 2D.

Result: 提供了全面的核均值嵌入字典和工具，增强了核基技术的适用性。

Conclusion: 通过提供字典和工具，解决了核均值嵌入闭式表达式不足的问题，推动了相关技术的应用。

Abstract: Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability
distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in
other computational tools for numerical integration or for statistical
inference based on the maximum mean discrepancy. These methods often require,
or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel
mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting
the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have
access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by
providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along
with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also
provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the
embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IPM在非参数判别器下计算复杂且难以扩展，因此需要一种参数化方法以简化实现并提升效率。

Method: 利用参数化判别器（如单节点ReLU神经网络）优化参数，提出高效算法，减少超参数需求。

Result: 理论证明具有良好收敛性，实验显示在因果推断和公平表示学习等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 参数化IPM在理论和实践中均表现优越，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We propose a parametric integral probability metric (IPM) to measure the
discrepancy between two probability measures. The proposed IPM leverages a
specific parametric family of discriminators, such as single-node neural
networks with ReLU activation, to effectively distinguish between
distributions, making it applicable in high-dimensional settings. By optimizing
over the parameters of the chosen discriminator class, the proposed IPM
demonstrates that its estimators have good convergence rates and can serve as a
surrogate for other IPMs that use smooth nonparametric discriminator classes.
We present an efficient algorithm for practical computation, offering a simple
implementation and requiring fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we explore its
applications in various tasks, such as covariate balancing for causal inference
and fair representation learning. Across such diverse applications, we
demonstrate that the proposed IPM provides strong theoretical guarantees, and
empirical experiments show that it achieves comparable or even superior
performance to other methods.

Result: 在3D心脏几何中建模时空电动力学，实验表明优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 几何感知和主动学习的结合显著提升了高维动态系统的预测精度。

Abstract: Rapid developments in advanced sensing and imaging have significantly
enhanced information visibility, opening opportunities for predictive modeling
of complex dynamic systems. However, sensing signals acquired from such complex
systems are often distributed across 3D geometries and rapidly evolving over
time, posing significant challenges in spatiotemporal predictive modeling. This
paper proposes a geometry-aware active learning framework for modeling
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we propose a geometry-aware
spatiotemporal Gaussian Process (G-ST-GP) to effectively integrate the temporal
correlations and geometric manifold features for reliable prediction of
high-dimensional dynamic behaviors. In addition, we develop an adaptive active
learning strategy to strategically identify informative spatial locations for
data collection and further maximize the prediction accuracy. This strategy
achieves the adaptive trade-off between the prediction uncertainty in the
G-ST-GP model and the space-filling design guided by the geodesic distance
across the 3D geometry. We implement the proposed framework to model the
spatiotemporal electrodynamics in a 3D heart geometry. Numerical experiments
show that our framework outperforms traditional methods lacking the mechanism
of geometric information incorporation or effective data collection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是最大化'完整性'，使训练模型的实测误差尽可能接近理论值。

Method: 通过数学推导计算岭回归的理想训练/测试分割比例，并分析其对岭参数α的依赖性。

Result: 发现分割比例对α的依赖渐近可忽略，仅与m和n相关，且与普通线性回归的分割比例在前两项渐近匹配。

Conclusion: 岭回归的训练/测试分割比例与普通线性回归在实际中无显著差异，且对α的依赖可忽略。

Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high
accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The
split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the
dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish
except for m and the number of features, n. This is the first time that such a
split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large
data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that
the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it
theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split
matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first
two terms asymptotically, and it appears that practically there is no
difference.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架在理论和实验上均表现出色，为RLHF中的动态上下文依赖性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a pivotal
paradigm in artificial intelligence to align large models with human
preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to
simultaneously conduct the online decision-making and statistical inference on
the optimal model using human preference data based on dynamic contextual
information. Our approach introduces an efficient decision strategy that
achieves both the optimal regret bound and the asymptotic distribution of the
estimators. A key challenge in RLHF is handling the dependent online human
preference outcomes with dynamic contexts. To address this, in the
methodological aspect, we propose a two-stage algorithm starting with
$\epsilon$-greedy followed by exploitations; in the theoretical aspect, we
tailor anti-concentration inequalities and matrix martingale concentration
techniques to derive the uniform estimation rate and asymptotic normality of
the estimators using dependent samples from both stages. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art strategies. We
apply the proposed framework to analyze the human preference data for ranking
large language models on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding dataset,
yielding insightful results on the performance of different large language
models for medical anatomy knowledge.

Result: 量化了模型大小（训练样本数与模型维度的比值）对双下降行为的影响。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析揭示了双下降现象的存在及其与模型复杂度的关系。

Abstract: Recent studies observed a surprising concept on model test error called the
double descent phenomenon, where the increasing model complexity decreases the
test error first and then the error increases and decreases again. To observe
this, we work on a two layer neural network model with a ReLU activation
function designed for binary classification under supervised learning. Our aim
is to observe and investigate the mathematical theory behind the double descent
behavior of model test error for varying model sizes. We quantify the model
size by the ratio of number of training samples to the dimension of the model.
Due to the complexity of the empirical risk minimization procedure, we use the
Convex Gaussian Min Max Theorem to find a suitable candidate for the global
training loss.

Abstract: When implementing prediction models for high-stakes real-world applications
such as medicine, finance, and autonomous systems, quantifying prediction
uncertainty is critical for effective risk management. Traditional approaches
to uncertainty quantification, such as confidence and prediction intervals,
provide probability coverage guarantees for the expected outcomes
$f(\boldsymbol{x})$ or the realized outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})+\epsilon$.
Instead, this paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic framework for
quantifying uncertainty in continuous and binary outcomes using confidence sets
for outcome excursions, where the goal is to identify a subset of the feature
space where the expected or realized outcome exceeds a specific value. The
proposed method constructs data-dependent inner and outer confidence sets that
aim to contain the true feature subset for which the expected or realized
outcomes of these features exceed a specified threshold. We establish
theoretical guarantees for the probability that these confidence sets contain
the true feature subset, both asymptotically and for finite sample sizes. The
framework is validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets,
demonstrating its utility in contexts such as housing price prediction and time
to sepsis diagnosis in healthcare. This approach provides a unified method for
uncertainty quantification that is broadly applicable across various continuous
and binary prediction models.

Method: 使用潜在变量模型对用户和物品进行聚类，提出一种同时利用用户和物品结构的算法。

Result: 算法在信息论下界下被证明接近最优，分析表明仅利用单一结构（如大多数协同过滤算法）是次优的。

Conclusion: 同时利用用户和物品结构的算法优于仅利用单一结构的传统方法。

Abstract: We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being
recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike'
feedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users
and items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the
item and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative
filtering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference
matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that
simultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal
via corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our
analysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user
structure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).

Motivation: 现有工具依赖简单启发式规则，难以处理复杂查询特征和相互影响，而强化学习方法虽具潜力，但面临调度空间大、采样成本高等挑战。

Method: BQSched设计了基于注意力的状态表示和IQ-PPO算法，并结合自适应掩码、查询聚类和增量模拟器优化策略。

Conclusion: BQSched是首个非侵入式RL批查询调度器，显著提升了效率、稳定性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Most large enterprises build predefined data pipelines and execute them
periodically to process operational data using SQL queries for various tasks. A
key issue in minimizing the overall makespan of these pipelines is the
efficient scheduling of concurrent queries within the pipelines. Existing tools
mainly rely on simple heuristic rules due to the difficulty of expressing the
complex features and mutual influences of queries. The latest reinforcement
learning (RL) based methods have the potential to capture these patterns from
feedback, but it is non-trivial to apply them directly due to the large
scheduling space, high sampling cost, and poor sample utilization.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose BQSched, a non-intrusive Scheduler
for Batch concurrent Queries via reinforcement learning. Specifically, BQSched
designs an attention-based state representation to capture the complex query
patterns, and proposes IQ-PPO, an auxiliary task-enhanced proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithm, to fully exploit the rich signals of Individual
Query completion in logs. Based on the RL framework above, BQSched further
introduces three optimization strategies, including adaptive masking to prune
the action space, scheduling gain-based query clustering to deal with large
query sets, and an incremental simulator to reduce sampling cost. To our
knowledge, BQSched is the first non-intrusive batch query scheduler via RL.
Extensive experiments show that BQSched can significantly improve the
efficiency and stability of batch query scheduling, while also achieving
remarkable scalability and adaptability in both data and queries. For example,
across all DBMSs and scales tested, BQSched reduces the overall makespan of
batch queries on TPC-DS benchmark by an average of 34% and 13%, compared with
the commonly used heuristic strategy and the adapted RL-based scheduler,
respectively.

Result: 与基线相比，延迟实现了2.1倍到8.3倍的加速。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多向量搜索索引调优问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Vector search plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. In
addition to single-vector search, multi-vector search becomes important for
multi-modal and multi-feature scenarios today. In a multi-vector database, each
row is an item, each column represents a feature of items, and each cell is a
high-dimensional vector. In multi-vector databases, the choice of indexes can
have a significant impact on performance. Although index tuning for relational
databases has been extensively studied, index tuning for multi-vector search
remains unclear and challenging. In this paper, we define multi-vector search
index tuning and propose a framework to solve it. Specifically, given a
multi-vector search workload, we develop algorithms to find indexes that
minimize latency and meet storage and recall constraints. Compared to the
baseline, our latency achieves 2.1X to 8.3X speedup.

Abstract: Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary

features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA
dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22%

of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for
hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance,
and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary
defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation
for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an
interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.

Conclusion: SPR对专家和AI均具挑战性，时间信息能提升表现，手术工具和器官是关键标志物，将推动自动化SPR的未来发展。

Abstract: Purpose: Automated Surgical Phase Recognition (SPR) uses Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to segment the surgical workflow into its key events,
functioning as a building block for efficient video review, surgical education
as well as skill assessment. Previous research has focused on short and linear
surgical procedures and has not explored if temporal context influences
experts' ability to better classify surgical phases. This research addresses
these gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly
non-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and
tasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video
snippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their
confidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI
architectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on
the Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset. Results:
Video snippets and presence of specific visual landmarks improved phase
classification accuracy across all groups. Surgeons displayed high confidence
in their classifications and outperformed novices, who struggled discriminating
phases. The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the
survey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases.
Conclusion: SPR is an inherently complex task for expert surgeons and computer
vision, where both perform equally well when given the same context.
Performance increases when temporal information is provided. Surgical tools and
organs form the key landmarks for human interpretation and are expected to
shape the future of automated SPR.

Conclusion: Res-SAM为地下异常检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，提升了城市安全监测能力并降低了成本。

Abstract: Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing
threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing
electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains
challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and
indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data
fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves
critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the
Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework
exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data.
Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal
prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing
information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and
complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world
experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%)
and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal
accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple
human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable,
resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across
diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a serious ocular complication of diabetes, is one
of the primary causes of vision loss among retinal vascular diseases. Deep
learning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). However, their performance declines significantly when
applied to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Domain
generalization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most
existing DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in
insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances
existing DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the
observation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion
structures. We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a
plug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG
models. LoASP improves generalization by learning adaptive structural
representations that are finely tuned to the complexities of DR diagnosis.
Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets validate its effectiveness in
both single-source and multi-source domain scenarios. Furthermore,
visualizations reveal that the learned structural priors intuitively align with
the intricate architecture of the vessels and lesions, providing compelling
insights into their interpretability and diagnostic relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通流量预测对智能交通系统至关重要，但现有深度学习模型因低通滤波效应和门控偏置等问题，难以同时捕捉长期趋势和短期波动。

Method: 采用混合深度学习框架，并行处理长期趋势和短期波动特征，并利用Bahdanau注意力机制选择关键时间步。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了多预测时间段的拟合优度，注意力机制尤其提升了短期预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强预测模型的鲁棒性和精确性，有助于更有效的拥堵缓解和城市交通规划。

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation
systems, yet accurately forecasting traffic remains challenging due to the
interaction between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Standard deep
learning models often struggle with these challenges because their
architectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing
on general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate
biases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize
long-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study
introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term
trend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed
in parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow
dynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically
Bahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic
data, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient
phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both
branches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit
statistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.
Notably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by
directly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully
integrating long-term trends. This framework can contribute to more effective
congestion mitigation and urban mobility planning by advancing the robustness
and precision of traffic prediction models.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种针对两相随机材料（TRMs）的应力预测框架，结合多成分U-net和物理信息神经网络（MPINN）方法，有效降低相边界应力预测误差，并实现任意倍数的应力图像超分辨率。

Motivation: 针对复杂微观结构材料（如TRMs）中相边界应力集中问题，现有深度学习方法因图像分辨率限制难以准确预测，且传统超分辨率技术缺乏物理约束。

Method: 1. 使用多成分U-net（MC U-net）预测低分辨率微观结构应力；2. 提出基于混合物理信息神经网络（MPINN）的超分辨率方法（SRPINN），无需配对训练数据即可提升分辨率。

Result: 通过迁移学习验证，该框架在不同相体积分数和加载状态下表现出高精度和良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂材料应力分析提供了有效工具，尤其在相边界应力集中区域的多尺度分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with
complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material
failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in
two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the
prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical
engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are
limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep
learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.
Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven
supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,
which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed
a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed
Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution
material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the
microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive
prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed
Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By
introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not
require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of
stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress
concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress
analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states
through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction
framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.

Conclusion: 该策略成功实现了高性能MLIP模型的设计，为复杂材料系统的模拟提供了有效工具。

Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning
interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative
reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a
unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher
information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to
guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the
model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an
adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a
case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset,
we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by
our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE
of 0.013 eV/atom.

Conclusion: 机器学习框架在软磁材料设计中具有潜力。

Abstract: We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation
magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys,
particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals
that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T
(DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and
structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic
saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T)
alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent
with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased
electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental
validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model,
with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed
uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature
importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a
nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and
annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such
as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further
applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional
space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET

Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic

Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD)

developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical
responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a

Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an
important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly
assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct
measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide
relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning
approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional
properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for
multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative
lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored
structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model
for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling
for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for
efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.

Abstract: Program synthesis is an umbrella term for generating programs and logical
formulae from specifications. With the remarkable performance improvements that
GPUs enable for deep learning, a natural question arose: can we also implement
a search-based program synthesiser on GPUs to achieve similar performance
improvements? In this article we discuss our insights on this question, based
on recent works~. The goal is to build a synthesiser running on GPUs which
takes as input positive and negative example traces and returns a logical
formula accepting the positive and rejecting the negative traces. With
GPU-friendly programming techniques -- using the semantics of formulae to
minimise data movement and reduce data-dependent branching -- our synthesiser
scales to significantly larger synthesis problems, and operates much faster
than the previous CPU-based state-of-the-art. We believe the insights that make
our approach GPU-friendly have wide potential for enhancing the performance of
other formal methods (FM) workloads.

Result: Rulebook能高效生成复杂环境，降低开发成本，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: Rulebook为强化学习环境开发提供了更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, due to their reliance on external
systems to learn from, require digital environments (e.g., simulators) with
very simple interfaces, which in turn constrain significantly the
implementation of such environments. In particular, these environments are
implemented either as separate processes or as state machines, leading to
synchronization and communication overheads in the first case, and to
unstructured programming in the second.
  We propose a new domain-specific, co-routine-based, compiled language, called
Rulebook, designed to automatically generate the state machine required to
interact with machine learning (ML) algorithms and similar applications, with
no performance overhead. Rulebook allows users to express programs without
needing to be aware of the specific interface required by the ML components. By
decoupling the execution model of the program from the syntactical encoding of
the program, and thus without the need for manual state management, Rulebook
allows to create larger and more sophisticated environments at a lower
development cost.

Conclusion: \alinet为EHT观测提供了一种高效且可靠的物理参数估计方法，同时考虑了未建模效应的不确定性。

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole
accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to
EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is
computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine
learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has
previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their
associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable
set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty
introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including
interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to
calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from
RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics models.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information
processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning,
with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this
paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural
network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate
this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving
memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal
correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory
capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons
successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial
orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal
correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of
nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for
designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel
insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and
nonlinear processing.

Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) applications often benefit from structured
sparsity, a technique that efficiently reduces model complexity and simplifies
handling of sparse data in hardware. Sparse systolic tensor arrays -
specifically designed to accelerate these structured-sparse ML models - play a
pivotal role in enabling efficient computations. As ML is increasingly
integrated into safety-critical systems, it is of paramount importance to
ensure the reliability of these systems. This paper introduces an online
error-checking technique capable of detecting and locating permanent faults
within sparse systolic tensor arrays before computation begins. The new
technique relies on merely four test vectors and exploits the weight values
already loaded within the systolic array to comprehensively test the system.
Fault-injection campaigns within the gate-level netlist, while executing three
well-established Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), validate the efficiency
of the proposed approach, which is shown to achieve very high fault coverage,
while incurring minimal performance and area overheads.

Abstract: Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) is an emerging paradigm that integrates neural
networks with symbolic reasoning to enhance the transparency, reasoning
capabilities, and data efficiency of AI systems. Recent NSAI systems have
gained traction due to their exceptional performance in reasoning tasks and
human-AI collaborative scenarios. Despite these algorithmic advancements,
executing NSAI tasks on existing hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) remains
challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory
intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms
exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them
incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need
for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads.
In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed
to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems.
NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data
dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a
reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and
mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves
31x speedup over Jetson TX2, more than 2x over GPU, 8x speedup over TPU-like
systolic array, and more than 3x over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates
enhanced scalability, with only 4x runtime increase when symbolic workloads
scale by 150x. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to
enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a
promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.

Abstract: The increased demand for data privacy and security in machine learning (ML)
applications has put impetus on effective edge training on Internet-of-Things
(IoT) nodes. Edge training aims to leverage speed, energy efficiency and
adaptability within the resource constraints of the nodes. Deploying and
training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based models at the edge, although
accurate, posit significant challenges from the back-propagation algorithm's
complexity, bit precision trade-offs, and heterogeneity of DNN layers. This
paper presents a Dynamic Tsetlin Machine (DTM) training accelerator as an
alternative to DNN implementations. DTM utilizes logic-based on-chip inference
with finite-state automata-driven learning within the same Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) package. Underpinned on the Vanilla and Coalesced Tsetlin
Machine algorithms, the dynamic aspect of the accelerator design allows for a
run-time reconfiguration targeting different datasets, model architectures, and
model sizes without resynthesis. This makes the DTM suitable for targeting
multivariate sensor-based edge tasks. Compared to DNNs, DTM trains with fewer
multiply-accumulates, devoid of derivative computation. It is a data-centric ML
algorithm that learns by aligning Tsetlin automata with input data to form
logical propositions enabling efficient Look-up-Table (LUT) mapping and frugal
Block RAM usage in FPGA training implementations. The proposed accelerator
offers 2.54x more Giga operations per second per Watt (GOP/s per W) and uses 6x
less power than the next-best comparable design.

using propositional logic constraints. We examine whether this approach can
identify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide
insights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce
Prompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into
logical constraints. The constraints are able to represent the intent of the
prompts in succinct and quantifiable ways. We used this approach to analyze a
dataset of 1,872 prompts from 203 students solving introductory programming
tasks. Findings. We find that while successful and unsuccessful attempts tend
to use a similar number of constraints overall, when students fail, they often
modify their prompts more significantly, shifting problem-solving strategies
midway. We also identify points where specific interventions could be most
helpful to students for refining their prompts. Implications. This work offers
a new and scalable way to detect students who struggle in solving natural
language programming tasks. This work could be extended to investigate more
complex tasks and integrated into programming tools to provide real-time
support.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学考试中表现优异，但在实际医疗建议场景中，用户交互成为主要挑战，导致准确率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在提供医疗建议中的实际应用效果，尤其是在公众使用时的表现。

Method: 在1298名参与者中，对比LLMs（GPT-4o、Llama 3、Command R+）与对照组在10个医疗场景中的表现。

Result: LLMs单独使用时准确率较高（识别病情94.9%，处置建议56.3%），但用户使用时准确率显著下降（病情识别<34.5%，处置建议<44.2%）。

Conclusion: 用户交互是LLMs在医疗建议中的主要障碍，建议在公共部署前进行系统性用户测试。

Abstract: Global healthcare providers are exploring use of large language models (LLMs)
to provide medical advice to the public. LLMs now achieve nearly perfect scores
on medical licensing exams, but this does not necessarily translate to accurate
performance in real-world settings. We tested if LLMs can assist members of the
public in identifying underlying conditions and choosing a course of action
(disposition) in ten medical scenarios in a controlled study with 1,298
participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive assistance from an
LLM (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) or a source of their choice (control). Tested
alone, LLMs complete the scenarios accurately, correctly identifying conditions
in 94.9% of cases and disposition in 56.3% on average. However, participants
using the same LLMs identified relevant conditions in less than 34.5% of cases
and disposition in less than 44.2%, both no better than the control group. We
identify user interactions as a challenge to the deployment of LLMs for medical
advice. Standard benchmarks for medical knowledge and simulated patient
interactions do not predict the failures we find with human participants.
Moving forward, we recommend systematic human user testing to evaluate
interactive capabilities prior to public deployments in healthcare.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多语言团队中ESL研究者的沟通挑战，提出了LINC系统以支持多语言协作，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言团队中ESL研究者因语言障碍难以充分参与讨论，限制了协作效果。

Method: 通过调查64名ESL研究者，提出四个设计目标，并开发LINC系统（实时多语言沟通模块和会后分析仪表板），通过六组多语言团队的两阶段研究评估系统。

Result: 使用LINC后，参与者能更自如地用母语交流，回顾会议要点，并有效准备后续会议。

Conclusion: LINC系统有效支持多语言协作，但还需考虑语言偏好外的其他因素，多模态系统在多语言混合协作中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Collaborative research often includes contributors with varied perspectives
from diverse linguistic backgrounds. However, English as a Second Language
(ESL) researchers often struggle to communicate during meetings in English and
comprehend discussions, leading to limited contribution. To investigate these
challenges, we surveyed 64 ESL researchers who frequently collaborate in
multilingual teams and identified four key design goals around participation,
comprehension, documentation, and feedback. Guided by these design goals, we
developed LINC, a multimodal Language INdependent Collaboration system with two
components: a real-time module for multilingual communication during meetings
and a post-meeting dashboard for discussion analysis. We evaluated the system
through a two-phased study with six triads of multilingual teams. We found that
using LINC, participants benefited from communicating in their preferred
language, recalled and reviewed actionable insights, and prepared for upcoming
meetings effectively. We discuss external factors that impact multilingual
meeting participation beyond language preferences and the implications of
multimodal systems in facilitating meetings in hybrid multilingual
collaborative settings beyond research.

Abstract: This paper critiques digital cloning in academic research, highlighting how
it exemplifies AI solutionism. Digital clones, which replicate user data to
simulate behavior, are often seen as scalable tools for behavioral insights.
However, this framing obscures ethical concerns around consent, agency, and
representation. Drawing on feminist theories of agency, the paper argues that
digital cloning oversimplifies human complexity and risks perpetuating systemic
biases. To address these issues, it proposes decentralized data repositories
and dynamic consent models, promoting ethical, context-aware AI practices that
challenge the reductionist logic of AI solutionism

range of queries, including sensitive mental health contexts. Despite
uncertainties about their effectiveness and reliability, the development of
LLMs in these areas is growing, potentially leading to harms. To better
identify and mitigate these harms, it is critical to understand how the values
of people with lived experiences relate to the harms. In this study, we
developed a technology probe, a GPT-4o based chatbot called Zenny, enabling
participants to engage with depression self-management scenarios informed by
previous research. We used Zenny to interview 17 individuals with lived
experiences of depression. Our thematic analysis revealed key values:
informational support, emotional support, personalization, privacy, and crisis
management. This work explores the relationship between lived experience
values, potential harms, and design recommendations for mental health AI
chatbots, aiming to enhance self-management support while minimizing risks.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发自适应的人机协作策略提供了框架支持。

Abstract: The goal of the current study is to introduce a triadic human-AI
collaboration framework for the automated vehicle domain. Previous
classifications (e.g., SAE Levels of Automation) focus on defining automation
levels based on who controls the vehicle. However, it remains unclear how human
users and AI should collaborate in real-time, especially in dynamic driving
contexts, where roles can shift frequently. To fill the gap, this study
proposes a triadic human-AI collaboration framework with three AI roles (i.e.,
Advisor, Co-Pilot, and Guardian) that dynamically adapt to human needs.
Overall, the study lays a foundation for developing adaptive, role-based
human-AI collaboration strategies in automated vehicles.

Conclusion: 展示了人机交互与机器响应之间的无缝互动，为实时音乐控制提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a real-time, human-in-the-loop gesture control framework that
can dynamically adapt audio and music based on human movement by analyzing live
video input. By creating a responsive connection between visual and auditory
stimuli, this system enables dancers and performers to not only respond to
music but also influence it through their movements. Designed for live
performances, interactive installations, and personal use, it offers an
immersive experience where users can shape the music in real time.
  The framework integrates computer vision and machine learning techniques to
track and interpret motion, allowing users to manipulate audio elements such as
tempo, pitch, effects, and playback sequence. With ongoing training, it
achieves user-independent functionality, requiring as few as 50 to 80 samples
to label simple gestures. This framework combines gesture training, cue
mapping, and audio manipulation to create a dynamic, interactive experience.
Gestures are interpreted as input signals, mapped to sound control commands,
and used to naturally adjust music elements, showcasing the seamless interplay
between human interaction and machine response.

methods, examines technical obstacles, and critically evaluates recent
developments in GAN-based VC. By consolidating and synthesizing research
findings scattered across the literature, this review provides a structured
understanding of the strengths and limitations of different approaches. The
significance of this survey lies in its ability to guide future research by
identifying existing gaps, proposing potential directions, and offering
insights for building more robust and efficient VC systems. Overall, this work

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅适用于BBC Rewind档案，还能扩展到其他大规模无约束档案的说话人检索任务。

Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned
audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient
access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This
paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of
speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two
primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata
for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic
conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse
noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive
(spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker
retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the
content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and
general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like
speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is
unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker
diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges,
possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we
conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various
distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems,
establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a
wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于专用架构和数据集特定的融合策略，难以学习跨数据集的通用表示或处理推理时的缺失模态。

Method: PhysioOmni训练解耦的多模态标记器，通过模态不变和模态特定的目标进行掩码信号预训练，并通过原型对齐在下游数据集上进行弹性微调。

Result: 在情感识别、睡眠阶段分类、运动预测和脑力负荷检测四个任务中，PhysioOmni实现了最先进的性能，同时对缺失模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PhysioOmni是一种高效的多模态生理信号分析基础模型，具有通用性和鲁棒性，代码和模型权重将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial
for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on
specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle
to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle
missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose
PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis
that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal
signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility
with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal
tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and
modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete
modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning
with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four
downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor
prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing
modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于电流的学习框架，用于随机建模，通过损失函数直接推导热力学函数，避免了传统方法的中间步骤，并揭示了机器学习扩散模型与随机热力学中熵产估计的深层联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算能力和数据获取能力的显著提升，数据驱动的逆动力学问题受到关注。研究旨在回答一个基本问题：如何从复杂动力系统的时间序列测量中学习？对于与外部环境交互的小系统，有效动力学本质上是随机的，因此需要正确处理数据中的噪声。

Method: 论文基于Langevin动力学系统，利用电流构建了一个随机建模的学习框架。通过建立累积电流与标准机器学习损失函数之间的基本关系，直接从系统动力学推导出多个关键热力学函数的损失函数。

Result: 提出的损失函数不仅复现了基于热力学不确定性关系（TURs）和其他方法的结果，还为以前无法访问的量（如每轨迹熵产）提供了新的损失函数。此外，方法还支持高阶估计。

Conclusion: 该方法简单直接，将动态推断与最近的熵产估计方法统一起来，揭示了机器学习扩散模型与随机热力学中熵产估计之间的深层联系。

Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to
growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer
a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a
complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external
environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it
crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems
obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning
framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased
attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic
uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between
the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using
this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly
from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a
TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other
methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions
for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to
per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far
from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is
straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy
production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between
diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in
stochastic thermodynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户常通过模糊或间接的查询（如“最佳越野跑鞋”）寻找产品，这类查询缺乏明确属性，对传统推荐系统构成挑战。

Method: 提出SUPERB四点标注框架，结合LLM生成产品标注，并评估现有检索和排名方法在新数据集上的表现。

Result: 实证评估了多种方法，为实际电商系统的集成提供了见解。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效处理隐式最高级查询，SUPERB框架为产品推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: In Recommender Systems, users often seek the best products through indirect,
vague, or under-specified queries, such as "best shoes for trail running". Such
queries, also referred to as implicit superlative queries, pose a significant
challenge for standard retrieval and ranking systems as they lack an explicit
mention of attributes and require identifying and reasoning over complex
factors. We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate implicit
attributes for ranking as well as reason over them to improve product
recommendations for such queries. As a first step, we propose a novel
four-point schema for annotating the best product candidates for superlative
queries called SUPERB, paired with LLM-based product annotations. We then
empirically evaluate several existing retrieval and ranking approaches on our
new dataset, providing insights and discussing their integration into
real-world e-commerce production systems.

derived from recipes and food nutrition data. The second is the FoodLog Athl
and the RecipeLog that are applications for collecting people's detailed
records about food habit. We also discuss several problems that we try to solve
to build the WFA by integrating these two ideas.

Motivation: 解决RAG中如何有效管理大量外部知识的问题，避免传统分块方法导致的上下文碎片化。

Method: 对延迟分块和上下文检索进行严格分析，评估其效果和效率。

Result: 上下文检索能更有效地保持语义连贯性，但计算资源需求更高；延迟分块效率更高，但牺牲了相关性和完整性。

Conclusion: 两种技术各有优劣，需根据具体需求权衡选择。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a transformative approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external
knowledge sources. Yet, a critical question persists: how can vast volumes of
external knowledge be managed effectively within the input constraints of LLMs?
Traditional methods address this by chunking external documents into smaller,
fixed-size segments. While this approach alleviates input limitations, it often
fragments context, resulting in incomplete retrieval and diminished coherence
in generation. To overcome these shortcomings, two advanced techniques, late
chunking and contextual retrieval, have been introduced, both aiming to
preserve global context. Despite their potential, their comparative strengths
and limitations remain unclear. This study presents a rigorous analysis of late
chunking and contextual retrieval, evaluating their effectiveness and
efficiency in optimizing RAG systems. Our results indicate that contextual
retrieval preserves semantic coherence more effectively but requires greater
computational resources. In contrast, late chunking offers higher efficiency
but tends to sacrifice relevance and completeness.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an
increasing number of researchers are exploring their application in
recommendation systems. However, the high latency associated with large models
presents a significant challenge for such use cases. The EReL@MIR workshop
provided a valuable opportunity to experiment with various approaches aimed at
improving the efficiency of multimodal representation learning for information
retrieval tasks. As part of the competition's requirements, participants were
mandated to submit a technical report detailing their methodologies and
findings. Our team was honored to receive the award for Task 2 - Winner
(Multimodal CTR Prediction). In this technical report, we present our methods
and key findings. Additionally, we propose several directions for future work,
particularly focusing on how to effectively integrate recommendation signals
into multimodal representations. The codebase for our implementation is
publicly available at: https://github.com/Lattice-zjj/MMCTR_Code, and the
trained model weights can be accessed at:

Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of
estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of
observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional
approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex
relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions
(SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to
tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel
matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly
over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm
style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated
heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency.
Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields
lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale
linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization.
Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide
theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time.
Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and
validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.

Result: NINODE控制器在特定条件下能渐近稳定负虚植物，并通过非线性质量-弹簧系统验证了其有效性和稳定性。

Conclusion: NINODE控制器通过神经网络的规范性约束实现稳定性，为机械系统控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose a neural control method to provide guaranteed stabilization for
mechanical systems using a novel negative imaginary neural ordinary
differential equation (NINODE) controller. Specifically, we employ neural
networks with desired properties as state-space function matrices within a
Hamiltonian framework to ensure the system possesses the NI property. This
NINODE system can serve as a controller that asymptotically stabilizes an NI
plant under certain conditions. For mechanical plants with colocated force
actuators and position sensors, we demonstrate that all the conditions required
for stability can be translated into regularity constraints on the neural
networks used in the controller. We illustrate the utility, effectiveness, and
stability guarantees of the NINODE controller through an example involving a
nonlinear mass-spring system.

Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject
to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric
variations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making
the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a
critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling
certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical
approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.
This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain
randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic
networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the
latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled
system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an
environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness
of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases
training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control
system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based
controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based
controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a
high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network
architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is
verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain
system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests
demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 准确建模气动系数对现代飞机系统的性能理解和优化至关重要。

Method: 采用eT2QFNN，通过增量学习策略和量子隶属函数建模非线性气动特性，并与传统方法对比。

Result: eT2QFNN在大量数据和有限数据情况下均表现优异，且规则数少于Type-1模糊模型。

Conclusion: eT2QFNN在气动系数建模中表现出优越性，并通过Delta方法验证了其稳定性。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding
and optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents
the novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network
(eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to
express the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear
aircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based
structure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional
batch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and
data noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic
rule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the
aerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different
studies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data
and the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling
performance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts.
Furthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared
to Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the
proposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are
analyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in
representing aerodynamic coefficients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献对利用机器学习技术构建的数字孪生进行实时数据分析的研究较少，尤其是在自主船舶领域。因此，论文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种能够提前检测异常状态的方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为ODDIT的数字孪生方法，该方法包含两个机器学习模型：一个用于预测未来船舶状态，另一个用于判断预测状态是否为分布外（OOD）。

Result: 在模拟环境中（包括传感器噪声、执行器噪声和海洋流等干扰），ODDIT在检测OOD状态方面表现出色，AUROC和TNR@TPR95分数达到99%。

Conclusion: ODDIT方法能够有效检测自主船舶的异常状态，为主动干预和测试提供了有力工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: An autonomous vessel (AV) is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) with
software enabling many key functionalities, e.g., navigation software enables
an AV to autonomously or semi-autonomously follow a path to its destination.
Digital twins of such AVs enable advanced functionalities such as running
what-if scenarios, performing predictive maintenance, and enabling fault
diagnosis. Due to technological improvements, real-time analyses using
continuous data from vessels' real-time operations have become increasingly
possible. However, the literature has little explored developing advanced
analyses in real-time data in AVs with digital twins built with machine
learning techniques. To this end, we present a novel digital twin-based
approach (ODDIT) to detect future out-of-distribution (OOD) states of an AV
before reaching them, enabling proactive intervention. Such states may indicate
anomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and
assist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two
machine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the
predicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across
waypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor
and actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current. ODDIT
achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD states, with AUROC and TNR@TPR95 scores
reaching 99\% across multiple vessels.

Abstract: Nash equilibrium is perhaps the best-known solution concept in game theory.
Such a solution assigns a strategy to each player which offers no incentive to
unilaterally deviate. While a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to always exist,
the problem of finding one in general-sum games is PPAD-complete, generally
considered intractable. Regret minimization is an efficient framework for
approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. However, in
general-sum games, such algorithms are only guaranteed to converge to a
coarse-correlated equilibrium (CCE), a solution concept where players can
correlate their strategies. In this work, we use meta-learning to minimize the
correlations in strategies produced by a regret minimizer. This encourages the
regret minimizer to find strategies that are closer to a Nash equilibrium. The
meta-learned regret minimizer is still guaranteed to converge to a CCE, but we
give a bound on the distance to Nash equilibrium in terms of our meta-loss. We
evaluate our approach in general-sum imperfect information games. Our
algorithms provide significantly better approximations of Nash equilibria than
state-of-the-art regret minimization techniques.

Abstract: Regret minimization is a general approach to online optimization which plays
a crucial role in many algorithms for approximating Nash equilibria in
two-player zero-sum games. The literature mainly focuses on solving individual
games in isolation. However, in practice, players often encounter a
distribution of similar but distinct games. For example, when trading
correlated assets on the stock market, or when refining the strategy in
subgames of a much larger game. Recently, offline meta-learning was used to
accelerate one-sided equilibrium finding on such distributions. We build upon
this, extending the framework to the more challenging self-play setting, which
is the basis for most state-of-the-art equilibrium approximation algorithms for
domains at scale. When selecting the strategy, our method uniquely integrates
information across all decision states, promoting global communication as
opposed to the traditional local regret decomposition. Empirical evaluation on
normal-form games and river poker subgames shows our meta-learned algorithms
considerably outperform other state-of-the-art regret minimization algorithms.

TL;DR: CDMEA提出了一种反事实去偏框架，通过因果视角解决多模态实体对齐中视觉模态的偏差问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖视觉模态，导致低相似度图像实体对齐效果不佳，需解决视觉模态偏差问题。

Method: 通过估计视觉和图模态的总效应（TE），并排除视觉模态的自然直接效应（NDE），确保模型基于总间接效应（TIE）预测。

Result: 在9个基准数据集上，CDMEA优于14种先进方法，尤其在低相似度、高噪声和低资源场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: CDMEA有效减少了视觉模态偏差，提升了多模态实体对齐的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from
different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information
retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and
consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while
overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively.
Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate
unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on
visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality,
leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a
counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates
visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage
both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct
causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the
Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect
(NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the
Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing
visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that
CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity,
high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成图像来源识别因生成器数量多、技术复杂且高质量数据集稀缺而具有挑战性，WILD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建包含10个封闭集和10个开放集生成器的数据集，每生成器1000张图像，部分经过后处理。

Result: WILD支持多种任务评估，并测试了七种基线方法在封闭和开放集识别中的表现。

Conclusion: WILD为合成图像来源识别提供了实用工具，模型在该数据集上训练有望提升性能。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is an open challenge, with an increasing
number of image generators being released yearly. The complexity and the sheer
number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of
high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make
training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very
challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to
provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image
attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular
commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution
models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world
in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a
total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set.
Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD
allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including
closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution
with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD
are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the
dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on
closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with
respect to post-processing.

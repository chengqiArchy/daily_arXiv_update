### [1] [Rosetta-PL: Propositional Logic as a Benchmark for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00001)
*Shaun Baek,Shaun Esua-Mensah,Cyrus Tsui,Sejan Vigneswaralingam,Abdullah Alali,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rosetta-PL是一个用于评估LLMs在逻辑推理和泛化能力的基准，通过将逻辑命题从Lean翻译为自定义逻辑语言来微调LLM（如GPT-4o）。实验表明，翻译过程中保留逻辑关系能显著提升精度，且训练样本超过20,000后准确率趋于稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要针对高资源自然语言训练，在低资源环境和需要深度逻辑推理的任务中表现受限。因此，需要一种方法来评估和优化LLMs在这些场景下的能力。

Method: 通过将Lean的逻辑命题数据集翻译为自定义逻辑语言，构建Rosetta-PL基准，并用于微调LLM（如GPT-4o）。实验分析了数据集大小和翻译方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 保留逻辑关系的翻译方法显著提升了模型的精度，且当训练样本超过20,000时，准确率趋于稳定。

Conclusion: Rosetta-PL为优化LLMs在形式推理任务中的训练提供了指导，同时有助于提升低资源语言应用的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

### [2] [Symbol grounding in computational systems: A paradox of intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00002)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，因为无论计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都会导致语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算主义在解释符号接地问题时的局限性，揭示其隐含的语义先天论。

Method: 通过逻辑分析，提出计算主义在符号接地问题上的悖论：无论计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都无法避免语义先天论。

Result: 计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，因为它要么预设语义先天论，要么无法实现符号接地。

Conclusion: 计算主义在解释符号接地问题时存在根本性缺陷，需要其他理论来补充或替代。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模和复杂度的增加，心理学理论被认为是实现人类认知、行为和互动的关键，本文旨在填补心理学在NLP应用中的空白。

Method: 综述了认知、发展、行为、社会、人格心理学及心理语言学等多领域的理论，分析其在LLM开发中的应用。

Result: 揭示了当前心理学理论在NLP中的应用趋势与不足，提出了跨领域整合的建议。

Conclusion: 心理学对LLM的发展至关重要，未来研究需更深入结合心理学理论以推动NLP进步。

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

### [4] [LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00004)
*Danilo S. Carvalho,Yingji Zhang,Harriet Unsworth,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangVAE是一个基于预训练大语言模型（LLMs）构建变分自编码器（VAEs）的新框架，能够生成更紧凑且语义解耦的表示，并提供分析工具LangSpace。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练语言模型的知识，构建更高效的文本表示框架，并系统化实验和理解文本表示。

Method: 在预训练LLMs上模块化构建VAEs，结合LangSpace工具进行表示分析（如向量遍历、解耦测量等）。

Result: 实验展示了不同编码器-解码器组合和标注输入的广泛交互，验证了框架在泛化和解耦方面的潜力。

Conclusion: LangVAE为文本表示的系统化实验和理解提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

### [5] [Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006)
*Hayden Helm,Tianyi Chen,Harvey McGuinness,Paige Lee,Brandon Duderstadt,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的美国国会议员虚拟模型，证明其符合数字孪生的定义，并展示了生成推文在预测投票行为和党派倾向中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过语言模型构建国会议员的数字孪生，以分析其行为并预测立法动态。

Method: 使用每日更新的国会议员推文数据集，训练语言模型生成与真实推文难以区分的文本。

Result: 生成的推文可用于预测投票行为和党派倾向，为资源分配提供支持。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字孪生在政治分析中的潜力，但也指出了局限性和未来扩展方向。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00009)
*Xiao Zhang,Kangsheng Wang,Tianyu Hu,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TA-LoRA是一种基于提示调优的多任务学习方法，通过低秩表示和快慢权重机制解决任务异质性，提升了性能并保持参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在处理未见任务时表现不佳，而多任务学习通过共享知识迁移解决这一问题。但现有方法如提示调优难以有效捕捉任务异质性。

Method: 提出TA-LoRA，结合低秩表示和快慢权重机制，慢权重编码共享知识，快权重捕捉任务特异性，并引入零初始化注意力机制减少干扰。

Result: 在16个任务上的实验表明，TA-LoRA在完整数据和少样本设置下均达到最优性能，同时保持参数高效。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA通过改进任务异质性建模，显著提升了多任务学习的性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于语言特征的检测方法，用于识别大型语言模型（LLMs）中的越狱行为，并在临床教育平台2-Sigma上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在敏感领域（如教育）中的安全使用受到越狱行为的威胁，因此需要开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 通过标注2300多个提示和158个对话，提取四个语言特征，并训练多种预测模型（如决策树、模糊逻辑分类器等）。

Result: 基于特征的预测模型表现优于提示工程，其中模糊决策树效果最佳。

Conclusion: 语言特征模型是有效的越狱检测方法，未来可探索结合提示和规则的混合框架。

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring
in educational LLMs.

### [10] [Performance Evaluation of Emotion Classification in Japanese Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00013)
*Yoichi Takenaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究旨在构建高精度模型预测日语文本中的八种Plutchik情绪，使用WRIME语料库微调预训练模型，DeBERTa-v3-large表现最佳，优于其他模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语文本情绪检测在社交媒体监控和客户反馈分析中需求高，但资源稀缺和类别不平衡限制了模型性能。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转换为二分类标签，微调四种预训练模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa-v3-base、DeBERTa-v3-large），并评估两种大型语言模型（TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct和ChatGPT-4o）。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large取得最佳平均准确率（0.860）和F1分数（0.662），在高低频情绪中均表现稳健，而大型语言模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调的DeBERTa-v3-large是目前日语二分类情绪检测的最可靠解决方案，未来需扩充稀有情绪数据并优化模型。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.
  This manuscript is under review for possible publication in New Generation
Computing.

### [11] [Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014)
*Vinit K. Chavan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，将句子嵌入约束在连续流形（如单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带）上，利用三元组损失作为训练目标，显著提升了嵌入的区分性和拓扑结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入通常位于无约束的欧几里得空间中，可能无法充分反映语言的复杂关系。通过引入流形约束，论文旨在探索几何表示学习在NLP中的潜力。

Method: 使用三元组损失作为核心训练目标，将句子嵌入约束在单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带等连续流形上。

Result: 在AG News和MBTI基准数据集上，流形约束嵌入（尤其是球面和莫比乌斯带投影）在聚类质量（轮廓分数）和分类性能（准确率）上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 流形空间中的嵌入能够通过拓扑结构补充语义分离，为NLP中的几何表示学习提供了新的数学基础方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of
embedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence
embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国等发展中国家的交通事故数据收集主要依赖人工，存在碎片化和不可靠的问题，导致数据缺失和不一致。研究旨在通过自动化系统解决这些问题。

Method: 系统包含四个模块：自动化网络爬虫代码生成、新闻收集、事故新闻分类与结构化数据提取、去重。使用多模态生成LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash实现自动化，并通过去重算法确保数据完整性。

Result: 系统在111天内从14个新闻网站收集了15,000多篇文章，识别出705起独特事故。代码生成模块校准准确率为91.3%，验证准确率为80%。吉大港事故最多（80起），高峰时段为早、中、晚。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的自动化系统能够高效、准确地收集交通事故数据，为孟加拉国的数据驱动道路安全政策制定提供了基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文将Text-to-SQL任务重新定义为教授大型语言模型（LLMs）表格数据推理的途径，提出两阶段框架，结合SQL监督和强化学习，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL任务仅关注查询生成，而本文旨在通过SQL监督开发可迁移的表格推理能力，提升模型的泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 1. 从真实SQL查询中合成详细的链式思维（CoT）跟踪，提供逐步监督；2. 引入GRPO强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性与通用推理能力关联。

Result: 方法在标准Text-to-SQL基准上表现优异，尤其在BIRD和CRT-QA数据集上提升显著，LLaMA和Qwen模型分别实现20%和5%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SQL不仅是目标形式，还能作为学习结构化数据推理的有效支架，增强模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

Abstract: To enable precise and fully automated cell type annotation with large
language models (LLMs), we developed a graph structured feature marker database
to retrieve entities linked to differential genes for cell reconstruction. We
further designed a multi task workflow to optimize the annotation process.
Compared to general purpose LLMs, our method improves human evaluation scores
by up to 0.21 and semantic similarity by 6.1% across 11 tissue types, while
more closely aligning with the cognitive logic of manual annotation.

Motivation: 解决长提示增加计算复杂性和经济成本的问题，同时保持LLM的响应质量。

Method: 研究六种提示压缩方法，并在13个数据集上评估其性能，涵盖生成性能、模型幻觉、多模态任务等。

Result: 实验显示提示压缩对长上下文任务影响更大，适度压缩在Longbench评估中甚至提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提示压缩是有效的，尤其在长上下文任务中，适度压缩可能带来性能提升。

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety
of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational
complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 研究使用DE-COP方法分析OpenAI模型是否未经许可使用O'Reilly Media的版权内容。GPT-4o对付费内容识别率高（AUROC=82%），而GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容更敏感。GPT-4o Mini则无显著识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查OpenAI模型是否在未经许可的情况下使用了受版权保护的O'Reilly Media书籍内容。

Method: 使用DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，分析34本O'Reilly Media书籍的数据集。

Result: GPT-4o对付费内容识别率显著（AUROC=82%），GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容更敏感，GPT-4o Mini无显著识别能力。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁提高企业透明度，建立AI内容训练的正式许可框架。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决食品危害检测中数据不平衡问题的方法，通过数据增强技术提升分类性能，结合BERT和RoBERTa模型及多种平衡策略，实验表明EDA和焦点损失显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品危害检测任务面临数据分布不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等挑战，需要有效方法提升分类性能。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的BERT和RoBERTa作为分类器，探索随机过采样、EDA和焦点损失等数据平衡策略。

Result: 实验表明EDA有效缓解类别不平衡，显著提升准确率和F1分数；结合焦点损失和过采样进一步增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品危害检测的NLP分类模型提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量对大语言模型性能的影响日益显著，但德语领域缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 结合启发式和模型过滤技术，并利用合成数据生成，构建了德语预训练数据集Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb。

Result: 在德语基准测试中，新数据集显著优于FineWeb2，甚至在8B规模下优于增强版FineWeb2。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的数据筛选和合成数据生成能显著提升预训练数据集质量。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Context Organizer (CORG)的框架，用于处理文档中复杂且不一致的知识关系，通过分组处理上下文，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料库中知识常因命名模糊、信息过时或错误而存在不一致性，导致上下文关系复杂，现有语言模型难以有效处理。

Method: CORG框架包含三个关键组件：图构造器、重新排序器和聚合器，将上下文分组独立处理以实现高效消歧。

Result: 实验表明，CORG在性能和效率上表现优异，优于现有分组方法，并与计算密集的单上下文方法结果相当。

Conclusion: CORG通过分组处理复杂上下文关系，为知识一致性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过二进制奖励优化工具使用能力的语言模型训练方法，避免了传统方法的局限性，并在实验中取得了优于GPT-4o的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在增强语言模型工具使用能力时，要么忽略了推理过程，要么生成了限制泛化能力的模仿推理，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用基于规则的强化学习训练范式，仅通过评估工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性的二进制奖励来优化模型。

Result: Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1系列模型在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级监督实现了模型自主内化推理策略，为工具使用能力的扩展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

Motivation: 解决医疗领域中大语言模型因专业知识壁垒、计算资源需求和部署环境限制而难以实际应用的问题。

Method: 设计知识转移管道（从70B教师模型到7B学生模型）、采用LoRA技术、实施4位权重量化、集成Flash Attention加速和连续批处理等推理优化技术。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上，模型在保持专业准确性的同时，内存消耗减少64.7%，推理延迟降低12.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）中的医疗大模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从文本中自动发现主题、动作、对象和状语维度的方法，以高效操作文本并支持自然语言查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过构建高质量的树结构，全面表示文本中的主题、动作、对象和状语及其子类关系，以支持自然语言查询和文本操作。

Method: 利用树结构的独立性避免冗余表示，并通过树结构的表达能力覆盖大多数句子。实验验证了基于子类关系构建的抽象树的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，抽象树的平均精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%。该方法在自然语言查询中表现出高覆盖率和快速搜索能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过树结构支持高效的自然语言查询和文本操作，具有较高的实用性和精确性。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升系统性能，检索效率更高，但仍落后于级联模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端语音对话系统的知识整合提供了有前景的方向，将公开代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Result: 实验证明SDFT在多领域中有效平衡了专业知识的获取与通用能力的保留。

Conclusion: SDFT提供了一种数据中心的对话模板，成功整合了基础对齐与目标知识。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在模拟历史文本风格时的局限性，避免年代错误。

Method: 通过提示和微调当代模型，测试其生成历史风格文本的能力。

Result: 微调模型可欺骗自动化评估，但人类仍能区分其输出与真实历史文本。

Conclusion: 需预训练模型以更可靠地模拟历史文本风格。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法仅生成逐步问题解决方案，缺乏对抽象元知识的捕捉，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: LEPA算法训练LLM在解决问题前生成预测性计划，并通过自我反思优化计划，最终预测计划和解决方案。

Result: LEPA在多个自然语言推理基准测试中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 通过提取和利用预测性计划，LEPA有效提升了LLM的泛化能力和问题解决效率。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 全球抑郁症患者超过3亿，但医疗资源分布不均和诊断方法复杂导致许多地区对此关注不足。

Method: 利用UK Biobank队列中的274,348条个体数据，设计表格数据转换方法，训练和评估基于LLMs的MDD-LLM框架。

Result: MDD-LLM（70B）的准确率为0.8378，AUC为0.8919，显著优于现有机器学习和深度学习框架。

Conclusion: MDD-LLM为抑郁症诊断提供了高效工具，并探讨了影响性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may
influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data
transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在Transformer中计算复杂度高，限制了模型的扩展性。本文旨在提出一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合时域（嵌入重构）和频域（短时傅里叶变换幅度匹配）的重构损失，以及高斯混合模型（GMM）先验，学习混合向量。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank等基准测试中，取得了与Transformer基线竞争的性能，同时显著降低了推理延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: 频谱字典模型是一种高效且可扩展的语言建模替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

Motivation: 尽管大参数LLMs在钓鱼邮件检测中表现优异，但其计算资源需求过高，因此探索小参数LLMs的可行性。

Method: 采用提示工程、解释增强微调和模型集成等方法优化小参数LLMs。

Result: 在SpamAssassin数据集上，准确率从基线模型的0.5提升至0.976。

Conclusion: 小参数LLMs通过优化方法可在钓鱼邮件检测中实现高性能，降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email
detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically
contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the
SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究嘻哈歌词的语言复杂性及其与社会文化趋势的关系，揭示其作为艺术形式和社会动态反映的演变。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术分析3814首歌曲，量化词汇多样性、押韵密度、主题内容和情感极性。

Result: 词汇多样性增加23.7%，押韵密度提高34.2%，主题内容从社会正义（28.5%降至13.8%）转向内省（7.6%增至26.3%），情感在政治危机时更负面。

Conclusion: 嘻哈歌词的演变既反映了艺术创新，也体现了社会动态，揭示了语言创新与文化背景的相互作用。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing
linguistic complexity and socio-cultural trends in hip-hop lyrics. Using a
dataset of 3,814 songs from 146 influential artists spanning four decades
(1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify
multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7%
increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

*Zhongren Chen,Joshua Kalla,Quan Le,Shinpei Nakamura-Sakai,Jasjeet Sekhon,Ruixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLM在说服选民方面与传统政治广告效果相当，但其成本更低（48-74美元/选民 vs 100美元/选民）。然而，传统方法目前更易扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM对民主社会的潜在威胁，特别是其说服能力是否比传统政治竞选更具成本效益。

Method: 通过两项调查实验（N=10,417）和真实世界模拟，评估LLM与人类互动及短期/长期说服效果。

Result: LLM说服成本更低，但传统方法更易扩展；LLM目前未显示出比非LLM方法更大的大规模说服潜力。

Conclusion: LLM能力提升后可能改变现状，但目前其大规模政治说服潜力有限。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

### [33] [HyPerAlign: Hypotheses-driven Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00038)
*Cristina Garbacea,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于假设驱动的个性化对齐方法（HyPerAlign），通过少量用户示例推断其偏好和风格，从而为大型语言模型（LLM）生成定制化输出。实验表明，该方法在作者归属和审议对齐任务中显著优于基于偏好的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通常针对“平均用户”偏好进行对齐，而实际使用中用户需求多样且具体，因此需要个性化的输出控制。

Method: 提出HyPerAlign方法，通过少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，并基于这些假设生成定制化输出。

Result: 在审议对齐任务中，LLM的有用性平均提升70%；在作者归属任务中，胜率通常超过90%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign是一种可解释且样本高效的LLM个性化策略，适用于多样化的用户场景。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律规范具有层次结构、引用网络和多版本特性，传统方法难以处理其复杂性。

Method: 通过结合层次结构和时间演化的知识图谱，以及综合文本单元，构建更丰富的法律知识表示。

Result: Graph RAG在法律规范数据集上的应用显著提升了法律人工智能的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供了更有效的工具，推动了法律AI的发展。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

*Peter West,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对齐技术（如RLHF）在LLM开发中广泛应用，但研究发现基础语言模型在某些任务（如随机数生成、混合策略游戏、创意写作）上表现优于对齐模型。对齐模型倾向于产生狭窄行为，导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对齐技术是否应普遍适用，揭示其在某些任务上的局限性，尤其是需要不可预测输出的任务。

Method: 研究对齐模型和基础模型在随机数生成、混合策略游戏（如石头剪刀布）和创意写作任务上的表现差异。

Result: 对齐模型在这些任务上表现较差，倾向于产生可预测或狭窄的输出，而基础模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 对齐技术并非适用于所有任务，存在性能权衡，需根据任务需求选择模型。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Motivation: 探索社交媒体情感分析在时尚趋势预测中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用自然语言处理和机器学习技术，包括情感分类、时间序列分解、因果建模和跨平台比较。

Result: 发现情感模式与时尚主题流行度相关，配饰和街头服饰趋势显著；Granger因果分析显示可持续性和街头服饰是主要趋势驱动因素。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情感分析可作为时尚趋势的有效早期指标，改进后的预测模型准确率达78.35%。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因聚类对毒性检测、传播建模和分类至关重要，但现有方法因多模态、文化背景和适应性不足而效果有限。

Method: 采用模板匹配结合多维相似性特征（形式、视觉内容、文本和身份），无需预定义数据库，支持自适应匹配。

Result: 新方法在聚类一致性和连贯性上优于现有方法，相似性特征集支持适应性并与人类直觉一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为网络迷因聚类提供了更有效的解决方案，代码已公开以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR在许多指标上接近或达到人类水平，但在复杂现实场景（如远距离语音）中表现仍不理想。现有数据集主要关注多麦克风阵列系统，而BERSt数据集旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 收集了98位演员在不同家庭环境中的近4小时英语语音数据，包括不同口音、情绪提示和喊叫/正常语音。智能手机被放置在19个不同位置，模拟复杂场景。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫程度下降，情绪识别表现不一。数据集对ASR和SER任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集为复杂环境下的语音识别任务提供了新基准，未来需进一步提升系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种事实一致性评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的SQL输出的语义准确性，并构建了一个领域特定的基准测试。实验结果显示，Exaone 3.5在简单任务上表现良好，但在复杂任务中存在显著退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自然语言接口中具有潜力，但在实际BI应用中存在语义幻觉、结构错误和缺乏领域评估框架的问题。

Method: 提出事实一致性评估框架，使用Exaone 3.5评估SQL输出的语义准确性，并构建包含219个自然语言问题的领域特定基准。

Result: Exaone 3.5在简单任务上表现良好（L1准确率93%），但在复杂任务中表现不佳（H1准确率4%），存在语义错误和非响应问题。

Conclusion: LLM在商业关键环境中仍有局限性，需要事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Method: 识别三种操纵策略，采用对抗训练方法，结合集成技术（如多数投票和岭回归）及大语言模型（如GPT-4）进行改进。

Result: 对抗训练显著降低系统被操纵的敏感性，集成技术和大语言模型进一步提升了防御能力。

Conclusion: 持续改进AI教育工具对确保其在高风险环境中的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure
their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

Result: 实验证明该指标能有效识别答案是否基于上下文，且计算高效、可解释、适应性强。

Conclusion: 该指标为开放书问答系统提供了一种可扩展且实用的上下文利用评估方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨文化真实性数据对低资源方言翻译的影响，挑战“数据越多越好”的范式。

Method: 比较了三种微调方法（基础、对比和语法提示微调），使用开源Aya23模型，并引入LebEval新基准。

Result: 文化感知的小数据集（LW）表现优于大规模非本地数据，对比微调结合对比提示效果最佳。

Conclusion: 文化真实性在方言翻译中至关重要，研究结果挑战了传统数据量优先的观点。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

Result: LLM在简单问题上过度推理，复杂问题上推理不足；通过长度优化可显著缩短输出且保持准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度是推理行为的重要信号，需进一步探索LLM在推理长度自适应上的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

*Yinghui He,Abhishek Panigrahi,Yong Lin,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了小语言模型（SLMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中的性能差距，提出了一种自适应方法AdaptMI+，通过选择性引入技能示例提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能策略在大语言模型（LLMs）中有效，但对小语言模型（SLMs）效果有限，甚至可能因信息过载而降低性能。

Method: 提出AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，基于认知负荷理论，仅在模型表现不佳时引入技能示例，并针对缺失技能补充示例。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，AdaptMI+比传统技能策略准确率提升高达6%。

Conclusion: 自适应技能选择策略能有效提升SLMs的ICL性能，避免认知过载。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的AI框架，用于分类放射学报告，通过提取关键查询和答案来预测诊断，提升临床信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在放射学报告分析中缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 结合信息追踪框架提取关键查询，使用Flan-T5模型判断事实存在，并训练分类器预测疾病。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了AI的可信度和实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过设计实现可解释性，有望推动医疗AI的临床采纳。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

Abstract: Despite growing global interest in Korean language education, there remains a
significant lack of learner corpora tailored to Korean L2 writing. To address
this gap, we enhance the KoLLA Korean learner corpus by adding multiple
grammatical error correction (GEC) references, thereby enabling more nuanced
and flexible evaluation of GEC systems, and reflects the variability of human
language. Additionally, we enrich the corpus with rubric-based scores aligned
with guidelines from the Korean National Language Institute, capturing
grammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. These enhancements make
KoLLA a robust and standardized resource for research in Korean L2 education,
supporting advancements in language learning, assessment, and automated error

Result: 发现当前研究在标准化定义、多语言评估和改进方法上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 亟需建立强大的基准测试和多学科方法，以确保语言模型在特定任务中的一致性，同时保持其实用性和适应性。

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education, presenting
unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning and streamlined content
creation. However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings
necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical
implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from

feedback, and ethical design principles to guide the development of effective
and responsible AI tools. We outline a structured three-phase approach
encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical
safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through
its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz
generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for
educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while

Motivation: 现有研究主要基于小规模成人数据集，缺乏针对青少年认知扭曲的大规模研究。

Method: 使用多LLM协商方法，结合认知澄清和认知平衡两种策略，优化分类并生成合成数据。

Result: LLM在显性标记分类上表现良好，但在上下文推理上准确性低于人类评估者。

Conclusion: KoACD数据集为未来认知扭曲检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CSE-SFP的创新方法，旨在为仅解码器的预训练语言模型（PLMs）提供高效的无监督文本表示框架。该方法通过单次前向传播实现对比学习，显著提升了嵌入质量并减少了训练时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督句子表示研究主要集中在判别式PLMs（如BERT），而生成式PLMs由于参数规模大，相关研究较少。然而，生成式架构在学术界和工业界占据主导地位，因此需要一种针对此类模型的高效无监督表示方法。

Method: 提出了CSE-SFP方法，利用生成模型的结构特性，通过单次前向传播实现无监督对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，CSE-SFP不仅生成更高质量的嵌入，还显著减少了训练时间和内存消耗。同时，引入了两种比率指标来评估编码模型的语义空间特性。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP为生成式PLMs提供了一种高效的无监督文本表示解决方案，并通过新指标增强了模型评估的鲁棒性。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical
expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts
for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause
clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM
vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical
expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present
the results of a replication study assessing the vulnerabilities across all
LLMs provided.

Motivation: 识别立法中的监管声明有助于衡量法规的密度和严格性，而计算方法可以高效处理大量欧盟立法文本（约18万份）。

Method: 提出了基于机构语法工具的定义，并开发了两种方法：依赖解析和基于Transformer的机器学习模型。

Result: 两种方法的准确率分别为80%和84%，K alpha为0.58，表明性能相似但一致性不高。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，未来可以结合使用以提高性能。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document
contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a
diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在现实应用中存在幻觉问题，影响事实可靠性，需要系统研究其认知动态。

Method: 使用Hallucination-Inducing Prompt（HIP）误导性融合语义远距概念，Hallucination Quantifying Prompt（HQP）评估输出的合理性、置信度和连贯性。

Result: 实验表明HIP能显著增加幻觉输出，不同模型表现各异，推理型LLM与通用型LLM有区别。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究幻觉脆弱性提供了可重复测试平台，有助于开发更安全、自省的大语言模型。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge
across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual
reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,
LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from
general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for
studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of
conceptual instability.

Motivation: 扩展LLMs的上下文窗口对长文本生成至关重要，但现有方法在内存需求和计算复杂度上面临挑战，且性能下降明显。

Method: 利用KV缓存在频域中能量集中于低频的特性，过滤高频成分以压缩缓存，提出FreqKV技术，无需额外参数或架构修改。

Result: 实验表明，FreqKV在长上下文任务中高效且有效，能够通过最小化微调扩展上下文窗口。

Conclusion: FreqKV通过频域压缩优化了KV缓存，为LLMs的上下文扩展提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model
size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing
fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method
with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant
matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and
computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number
of parameters than VeRA, $16\times$ smaller than LoRA and $32\times$ less FLOPs
than FourierFT, while maintaining close or better task performance. Our
approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型需要大量计算资源，而领域特定的小型模型在适应时往往性能下降，因此需要一种高效的方法来优化领域性能。

Method: FineScope利用稀疏自编码器提取领域特定子集，结合结构化剪枝和自数据蒸馏，恢复剪枝中丢失的关键信息。

Conclusion: FineScope提供了一种高效的方法来优化领域特定LLM，其框架和数据集对未剪枝模型也有提升效果。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

Method: 通过一个简单的实验框架，发现微调模型依赖任务类型和文本起始位置作为角色识别的代理，提出通过调整位置ID等输入编码中的不变信号来强化角色边界。

Result: 调整位置ID等方法帮助模型更清晰地区分角色，减少对表面代理的依赖。

Conclusion: 通过机制中心的视角，研究展示了LLMs如何更可靠地维护多角色行为，而非仅记忆已知提示或触发点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备理解对话意义的能力，回应相关争议。

Method: 采用思想实验和半形式化论证，分析LLMs的局限性。

Result: 发现LLMs存在固有歧义障碍，无法真正理解对话内容。

Conclusion: LLMs的流畅对话能力不代表其具备真正的理解能力。

Abstract: A lively ongoing debate is taking place, since the extraordinary emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) with regards to their capability to understand the
world and capture the meaning of the dialogues in which they are involved.
Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought
experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical
linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief
paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and
semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which
prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent
dialogues mean.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在微调和上下文学习中的泛化能力差异，以解决模型在实际应用中因泛化不足而受限的问题。

Method: 构建新数据集以隔离预训练知识，通过控制信息子集（上下文或微调）评估模型在多种泛化任务中的表现。

Result: 上下文学习在数据匹配设置下泛化更灵活，同时提出结合上下文推理的微调方法能显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同学习模式的归纳偏置差异，并提供了提升语言模型性能的实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，如何提供准确且可扩展的反馈成为关键问题。当前LLM批评模型的批评过于浅显，导致判断准确性低且无法提供足够反馈。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 使用Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct生成4.5K长形式批评数据用于监督微调；2) 利用强化学习（基于PRM800K或自动标注数据）进一步提升批评能力。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的批评模型在多个错误识别基准上显著优于现有模型（包括DeepSeek-R1-distill和GPT-4o），并能更有效地帮助生成模型修正错误。

Conclusion: 所提出的两阶段框架显著提升了LLM批评模型的批评能力，为LLM的自动监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本风格转换方面表现出色，但如何有效利用其能力进行基于示例的任意风格转换仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用基于语域分析的提示方法，指导LLMs完成任务。

Result: 在多个风格转换任务中，该方法在增强风格转换强度的同时更有效地保留了原文意义。

Conclusion: 该提示方法为LLMs在风格转换任务中的应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical
developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their
technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying
theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,
especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose
a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the
technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic
feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing
contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents
to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical
Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy
methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative
paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving
equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a
forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.
Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of
human cognition and AI capability.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别和分割神经纤维束，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in
particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of
the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this
anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as
found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined
with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities,
relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is
then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of
relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is
proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and
diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in
pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.

Result: 企业研究集中于预部署领域，部署阶段问题关注减少，高风险领域研究不足。

Conclusion: 建议扩大外部研究者对部署数据的访问，系统性观测市场AI行为，以弥补知识缺口。

Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI
papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI
companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI
universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of
Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on
pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while
attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant
research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare,
finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and
copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate
concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external
researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market
AI behaviors.

Abstract: As AI systems become embedded in real-world applications, ensuring they meet
ethical standards is crucial. While existing AI ethics frameworks emphasize
fairness, transparency, and accountability, they often lack actionable

Responsible AI Labs (RAIL) framework, which includes eight measurable
dimensions to assess the normative behavior of large language models (LLMs). We
apply this framework to Anthropic's "Values in the Wild" dataset, containing
over 308,000 anonymized conversations with Claude and more than 3,000 annotated

Result: 实验显示DeCo任务处理成功率超过80%，并能平衡工程师工作量。

Conclusion: DeCo作为AI驱动方案，在IC故障分析与任务处理中展现出实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital
role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements
in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right
engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies
emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the
integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC
handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative
approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel
defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships
to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced
by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a
contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by
considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable
and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different
scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can
assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world
IC failure analysis and task handling.

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了从遥测数据中自动化发现玩家心理和战术，并通过桥接损失实现了网络的协作训练。

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at
the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in,
e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is
rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help
create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her
impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this
knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted
player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards
players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on
discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous
sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a
sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We
propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses
on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while
the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a
supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual
objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired
decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and
one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player
psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic
explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of
the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel
formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining
homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms
the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces
challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.
Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,
and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This
paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large
Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi
autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground
transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate
adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace
closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric
scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic
resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without
centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation
networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this
work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with
future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

Result: 实验证明ScaleTrack能有效解释GUI图像与动作的对应关系，并描述GUI环境的演化规则。

Conclusion: ScaleTrack为解决GUI代理训练中的关键挑战提供了有效方案，数据和代码将公开。

Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Abstract: Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has
transformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and
multi-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user
preferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This
paper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed
to enhance smart spaces through dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This
framework integrates personalized Large Language Model (LLM) agents that
leverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and
adaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control
system, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time
responsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix
achieves resource-efficient AI interactions by embedding memory-augmented
reasoning, cooperative agent negotiation, and adaptive orchestration
strategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with
proactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information
(VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM
agent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless
environment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system
efficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.

of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of
precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how
decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based
classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time
element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier
framework.

*Phanish Puranam,Prothit Sen,Maciej Workiewicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT4在类比推理中表现出高召回率但低精确度，而人类则相反。研究发现，人类在识别深层结构相似性上优于AI，建议在决策中分工合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究GPT4在战略决策中的类比推理能力是否能与人类匹敌。

Method: 采用源目标匹配实验设计，比较GPT4与人类的表现。

Result: GPT4召回率高但精确度低，人类精确度高但召回率低。AI错误源于表面匹配，人类错误源于因果结构误解。

Conclusion: 建议AI作为类比生成器，人类作为评估者，实现分工合作。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can
match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision
making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target
matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible
analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect
analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants
exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with
stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying
matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that
requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs
are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative
advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error
analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas
human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,
the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted
organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy
generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most
contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MCTS算法的搜索树复杂性，其可解释性较差，导致对AI在序列规划中的信任不足。本文旨在通过自然语言解释框架解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了一个计算树逻辑引导的大语言模型框架，将用户查询转化为逻辑和变量语句，确保解释与底层环境动态和约束一致。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了MCTS的可解释性，增强了用户对AI在序列规划中的信任。

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language
model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to
interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is
flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and
knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and
variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the
search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental
dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We
evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it
demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Motivation: 传统机器学习评估方法无法满足现代生成式AI模型的需求，亟需新的评估策略。

Result: AI竞赛的实践为生成式AI评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 生成式AI评估应借鉴AI竞赛的严谨性，提升实证评估的可靠性。

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI
is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking
strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models
and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these
models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do
not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong
feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model
outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em
leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult
issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI
Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage
for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition
setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized)
resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold
standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest
their results with according value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集中式IoV解决方案存在高延迟、扩展性差和依赖专有AI模型的问题，而LLM在车辆系统中的集成尚未充分探索。

Method: FPoTT采用动态提示优化机制和双层联邦学习架构，结合边缘模型和云端LLM，并利用Transformer生成合成数据。

Result: FPoTT在真实数据上达到99.86%的预测准确率，并在合成数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 开源LLM为IoV管理提供了安全、自适应和可扩展的解决方案，是专有系统的有前途替代方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化跑步表现、定制训练计划和运动员健康管理需要理解生理反应，但目前缺乏基于消费级设备的精准代谢监测方法。

Method: 采用两种互补的生理模型：1) 通过生理约束的ODE和神经卡尔曼滤波器建模心率动态；2) 基于心率模型的新型VO₂预测架构，仅需初始VO₂数据校准。

Result: 方法在心率预测中平均绝对误差低至2.81 bpm（相关性0.87），VO₂预测平均绝对百分比误差约13%，能捕捉快速生理变化和稳态。

Conclusion: 该框架将实验室级精度与日常可访问性结合，为非侵入性代谢监测提供了新途径，适用于精英运动员和普通健身者。

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for
performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health
management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the
first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$)
trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach
employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart
rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR
observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors
as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of
precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only
the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,
sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on
smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage
errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological
transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our
synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays
the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By
embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this
framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade
accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and
recreational fitness enthusiasts.

Motivation: 结合高斯混合和粒子滤波技术的优势，提升多目标滤波的性能和准确性。

Method: 利用后验强度函数生成粒子，通过系统动力学传播，并使用KDE技术近似高斯混合先验强度函数。

Result: 实验表明，EnGM-PHD滤波器在相同组件或粒子数量下，性能优于GM-PHD和SMC-PHD滤波器。

Conclusion: EnGM-PHD滤波器在多目标滤波中表现更优，且在某些情况下可简化为标准EnGMF。

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications.
The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the
particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis
Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the
posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and
then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the
Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees
convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of
components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births,
deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces
to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented
experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better
multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters
while using the same number of components or particles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将基于任务的C++代码（使用HPX异步运行时模型）通过pybind11绑定到Python API的新方法，开发了并行高斯过程库GPRat，展示了其在性能和扩展性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python是AI开发的主流语言，但现有库（如PyTorch、TensorFlow）仅依赖低层并行化可能导致性能和扩展性下降，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用HPX异步运行时模型和pybind11将C++代码绑定到Python，开发了并行高斯过程库GPRat。

Result: GPRat在64核AMD EPYC 7742 CPU上表现出色，训练速度优于GPyTorch和GPflow，预测速度分别提升7.63倍和25.25倍。

Conclusion: 异步任务在Python AI应用中具有巨大潜力，GPRat展示了其性能和扩展性优势。

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial
intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow,
rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on
CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to
performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of
binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a
high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process
(GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines
the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and
scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a
mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for
varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding
overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to
GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD
EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction
speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number
of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19,
respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks
within Python-based AI applications.

Conclusion: BF-SSD通过整合双精度策略，为大规模高维问题提供了一种高效且计算成本低的零阶优化方法。

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous
scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and
gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order
optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are
inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost
associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity
stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order
optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD
leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a
combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate
high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an
efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we
provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct
problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge
regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and
transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results
demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance
while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to
relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating
bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as
a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale,
high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Result: 模型准确率达70%，优于传统统计方法，并识别出手术时长和住院时间等新影响因素。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了预测性能，还为临床医生提供了患者特异性解释，有助于个性化管理。

Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in
oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence
triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and
escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However,
existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often
overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for
patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning
framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve
NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for
categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,
allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes
and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the
data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction
performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides
clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential
features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves
accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical
methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through
feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new
important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and
hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction
models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality
worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient
outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex
nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and
thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN),
Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease
outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including
handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation,
followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad
precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used
to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that
ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently
outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly
in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML
and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis
and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data
quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational
techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of
chronic diseases. This study was conducted as part of Big Data class project

Result: Matryoshka SAEs在重建损失和语言建模任务中表现更优，但剪枝SAEs更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了性能与可解释性之间的权衡，为未来优化稀疏自编码器提供了方向。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
\citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders}
rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural
networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to
representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however,
computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially
when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary
importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding
based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or
so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs
\citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling
task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured
language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned
vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and
implications of this trade-off.

Conclusion: 该框架为建模脑活动提供了可扩展且个体化的方法，适用于计算神经科学和临床研究。

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on
low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain
activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual
differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods
either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is
temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because
event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can
capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and
temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two
naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework
outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and
individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales
efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test
this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data
from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our
method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with
schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework
scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen
subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal
clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal
ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation
in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings
suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific
brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and
individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in
computational neuroscience and clinical research.

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发结合生成式机器学习与控制技术的集成框架，以应对现代制造系统的动态复杂性。

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by
time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These
characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing
multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to
real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative
machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex
distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing
uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic
manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to
translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls
while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification
of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated
approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced
control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML
architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties
and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional
methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing
control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and
digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between
generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of
manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To
address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at
developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control
technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing

<details>

Conclusion: 论文提出的“专有联邦学习”算法有效解决了黑盒AI在混合专家模型中的优化问题，为这一未充分探索的领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary,
offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their
internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This
black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert
type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's
internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive
game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing
against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to
their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the
user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing
AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,
which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between
any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI
agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning
algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their
machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain
refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature
models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning''
algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series
benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy
over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this
natural problem still being largely unexplored.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于历史数据的纵向表格Transformer模型（LTT），用于提高自然灾害期间的电力恢复时间预测准确性，显著提升了客户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着气候变异性增加，电力公司需要更精确的电力恢复时间预测（ETR），但现有方法依赖人工或传统统计模型，精度不足。

Method: 提出LTT模型，利用历史停电事件数据和顺序更新，结合客户满意度指标和可解释性技术。

Result: 模型在34,000次风暴相关停电事件中测试，客户满意度指标（CSI）平均提升19.08%（p>0.001）。

Conclusion: LTT模型不仅提高了预测精度，还增强了透明度和客户信任，为电力恢复预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver
precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has
become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for
enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed
decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.
Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual
assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the
level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address
these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model
that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of
these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's
performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three
major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a
2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer
Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression
metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the
outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ
interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of
incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the
contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive
approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,
fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Result: 在ALFWorld、Wordcraft和InterCode-SQL基准测试中性能显著提升，最高达到91%的准确率。

Conclusion: 自动轨迹数据库构建是替代繁琐知识工程的有效方法。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional
medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern
drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value.
A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases
and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine
ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association
prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation
learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node
embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next,
the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to
enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and
robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more
accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the
model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The
results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed
existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby
indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further
revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case
studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive
retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking
experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction
and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the
Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts
ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic
information.

Conclusion: HFGNN方法有效解决了金融数据跨境流动和共享中的隐私问题，提升了数据共享的效率和安全性。

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial
institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of
interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To
effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow
and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize
the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations
in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural
Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous
business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the
sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a
statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each
subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local
training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated
parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature
information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show
that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence
speed than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于雷达后向散射与地表特性的复杂交互，传统WCM在多样农业景观中表现受限，需要更精确的SM估计方法。

Method: 提出了一种知识引导的LSTM模型，结合WCM原理和双组分损失函数，利用Sentinel-1 SAR数据和Landsat植被信息进行SM估计。

Result: 模型在植被覆盖和地表条件变化区域中，SM估计不确定性降低了0.02 m³/m³，相关性系数（R）达到0.64。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了WCM的过度简化问题，展示了在复杂农业景观中估计SM的潜力。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging
due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface
characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical
approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often
limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research
presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning
approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal
dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified
dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and
a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the
soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together
with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A
four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to
assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM
retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation
coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and
surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the
over-simplification in WCM.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective
human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or
guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,
strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human
skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a
strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,
the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate
player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that
human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to
improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.
Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different
skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We
then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to
estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method
achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which
increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous
state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20
matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements
in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength
estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: HMFNet在分子结构表示和AI驱动技术发展方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to
predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can
suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic
descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder
effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class
imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these
challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature
Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local
Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature
extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor
prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we
integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically
learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's
capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy
Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the
molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global
information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To
further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed
Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its
potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the
development of AI-driven technologies.

Result: 循环GNNs能够达到颜色细化算法的极限，且通过随机初始化可以模拟所有图算法。

Conclusion: 循环GNNs在表达能力上优于非循环GNNs，且能高效模拟多项式时间复杂度的图算法。

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural
Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that
recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph
algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the
color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that
the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI
2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually
reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the
power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every
graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we
construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent
GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph
algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN
with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

Conclusion: TAEGCN能有效捕捉时间因果关系和隐藏的空间依赖性，显著提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states
by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes.
Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple
dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph
structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph
structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.
Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary
significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and
spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional
Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates
causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn
temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure
based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in
spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal
relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,
TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these
components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two
public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed model.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了多元时间序列预测中的依赖关系建模问题，性能显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is
available at this repository: https://github.com/nyuolab/Gateformer.

Motivation: 解决自注意力机制的高计算成本问题，同时保持或提升性能。

Method: 采用Mixture of Sparse Attention（MoSA），动态选择token，降低计算复杂度。

Result: MoSA在相同计算预算下性能优于密集基线，最高提升27%困惑度。

Conclusion: MoSA在性能、速度和资源使用上均优于密集自注意力，是一种高效替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Conclusion: 深度学习可作为CPM的高效替代模型，支持更大时空尺度的生物过程模拟。

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for
developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological
systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due
to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual
model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate
model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary
conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM
previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate
model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,
MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to
CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively
captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts
model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction
of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning
to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster
evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater
spatial and temporal scales.

Motivation: 现代科技趋势倾向于高维向量测量，而传统的凸优化方法（如Basis Pursuit）在高维情况下表现不佳。

Result: 大量实验验证了SteinSense的有效性和鲁棒性，理论分析基于近似消息传递。

Conclusion: SteinSense在高维向量恢复中表现优异，且对实际数据和理论条件的偏离具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements
rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For
about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been
synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In
the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a
straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex
Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly
when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight
iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not
have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero
knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this
makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume
of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,
and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate
Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,
delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under
substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无线联邦LoRA微调框架，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和自适应稀疏化方法（SOFT）优化学习性能和通信效率，实验表明其能显著减少通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习（FL）环境中微调大型语言模型（LLMs）面临资源限制和通信开销的挑战，需要一种高效的方法。

Method: 提出无线联邦LoRA框架，结合SOFT（自适应稀疏化方法）和TSFA（两阶段联邦算法），优化参数更新和带宽调整。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在基准数据集上达到理想场景模型的精度，同时显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实无线FL场景中大规模模型的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated
learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints
and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues
by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large
models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework
that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We
provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance
effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose
Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification
method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix
multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations.
Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA})
algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts
bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency
constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing
communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient
deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

TL;DR: T2VPhysBench是一个基于物理第一性原理的基准测试，用于评估文本到视频生成模型是否遵守核心物理定律，结果显示现有模型普遍表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频生成模型在美学和指令遵循上表现优异，但其对基本物理定律的遵守能力尚未得到充分测试，导致生成内容可能违反物理规则。

Method: 通过T2VPhysBench基准测试，结合人类评估和三项具体研究（总体合规性评估、提示消融实验和反事实鲁棒性测试），系统评估模型对12项核心物理定律的遵守情况。

Result: 所有模型在各项物理定律上的平均得分均低于0.60，即使提供详细提示也无法显著改善物理违规问题，且模型在反事实指令下会生成明显违反物理规则的视频。

Conclusion: 当前模型在物理规则遵守方面存在显著不足，未来研究需进一步改进架构以实现真正物理感知的视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型轻量级优化器SOLO，通过超低精度量化（低至2-3位）显著减少内存占用（如7B模型节省约45GB），同时保持收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型规模爆炸式增长导致训练/微调成本高昂，尤其是状态优化器的内存开销问题。

Method: 采用超低精度量化（2-3位），通过解决无符号量化中的信号淹没问题和有符号量化中的梯度方差问题，实现轻量级状态优化。

Result: SOLO在7B模型训练中节省约45GB内存，且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: SOLO有望突破计算资源瓶颈，提升基础研究的可及性。

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive
training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain
auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence.
We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with
extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision
quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit
or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision
as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem
in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the
rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to
incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored
logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value
for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory
savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy
loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in
computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental
research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for
effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy
Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.
However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on
large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and
geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform
well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate
predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly
electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively
across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is
demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime
climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves
high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its
robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and
winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against
state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results
indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing
its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying
climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the
model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy
Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage
Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Conclusion: 安全驱动量化是一种高效优化深度学习模型的可靠策略。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices
necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance
the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study
introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages
preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights,
thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed
methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability
across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our
framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the
original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In
comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only
augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential
weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical
model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven
quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization
of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental
evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.

Motivation: 现有数据混合方法依赖预定义域且计算成本高，无法充分捕捉语义细节。

Method: R&B通过语义相似性重新分组数据（Regroup），并利用域梯度诱导的Gram矩阵高效优化数据组成（Balance）。

Result: 在五个多样化数据集上，R&B以仅0.01%额外计算开销匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: R&B通过自适应数据混合策略显著提升性能，且计算成本极低。

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Motivation: 现有密度聚类算法难以同时处理任意形状、多密度、高维数据且抗噪能力不足，导致聚类质量下降。

Result: 实验表明，TNStream在多密度数据上显著提升了聚类质量，验证了所提理论的可行性。

Conclusion: TNStream是一种高效、全在线的数据流聚类算法，适用于复杂数据场景。

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms
remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained
attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle
arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining
strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when
data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based
on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream
clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this
paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm
adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,
summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It
then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final
clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge
of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and
real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density
data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

Motivation: 现有基于子图的可解释方法过于关注局部结构，可能忽略图中的长程依赖关系；而基于图粗化的方法虽有助于全局可解释性，但固定粒度的粗化方式无法适应现实任务中多粒度的关系。

Method: TIF将普通GNN转化为分层树结构，每层包含不同粒度的粗化图作为树节点。通过图粗化模块迭代压缩原始图，并通过图扰动模块保持分支多样性，最后使用自适应路由模块选择信息量最大的路径。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，TIF在可解释性方面表现优越，同时预测性能与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: TIF通过多粒度树状结构实现了全局可解释性，同时保持了高性能，为图分类任务提供了一种新的可解释框架。

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying
reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific
subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable
methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking
long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that
rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,
they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible
way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world
graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,
relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,
and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like
Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are
transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs
of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a
graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)
into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving
diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph
perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify
the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final
prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making
process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in
interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance
akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

Motivation: 终端设备上的机器学习模型面临动态数据漂移的挑战，传统集中式持续学习方法因隐私和数据量问题不适用，因此需要一种联邦持续学习解决方案。

Method: SacFL采用编码器-解码器架构分离任务组件，结合对比学习实现自主任务检测，支持设备自主触发持续学习或防御策略。

Conclusion: SacFL为终端设备提供了一种高效、自主的联邦持续学习解决方案，解决了存储和任务检测的挑战。

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,
wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data
generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by
continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device
models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling
machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is
unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this
context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,
preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative
updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor
autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial
tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL
employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and
task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining
lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.
Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an
autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new
task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately
allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without
additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and
THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both
class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system
has been developed to verify its practicality.

Motivation: 准确预测包裹送达时间对物流行业至关重要，尤其是在混合物流场景中，取件任务对快递员决策行为的影响更大，但现有研究未能充分区分取件和派送的不同影响。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器架构捕捉快递员历史路径和待处理包裹的时空依赖，设计模式记忆模块通过注意力机制学习不平衡数据集中的取件模式，并将路径预测作为送达时间预测的辅助任务。

Result: 在真实工业规模数据集上的实验证明了方法的优越性，TransPDT系统已在京东物流内部部署，每日追踪北京2000多名快递员处理数十万包裹的数据。

Conclusion: TransPDT通过多任务学习和时空依赖建模，有效解决了混合物流场景中的送达时间预测问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics
industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service
guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where
couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup
simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and
delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the
pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the
delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three
main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately
interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups
have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it
challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'
spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,
but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,
a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first
employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal
dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.
Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the
imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as
an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior
courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on
real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A
system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more
than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in
Beijing.

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has
brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In
this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based
on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We
provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the
two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us
to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target
network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay
term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the
stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle
and an operator comparison to establish these results.

Result: 在约束连续变化较小的假设下，实现了零约束违反和次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 本文首次为动态约束变化的OCO提供了绝对安全性的可证明保证。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in
Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic
constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow
for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining
strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely
the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.
This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in
the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables
ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our
framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable
guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints
in OCO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流行业需要提前预测快递员的准时送达率以采取预防措施，尤其是在异常情况下（如疫情），现有研究对此关注不足且未能明确建模异常事件。

Method: 设计了异常时空学习模块（使用RNN建模事件信息）、Node2vec建模区域相关性、图神经网络和LSTM捕捉时空依赖，并提出异常模式注意力模块（使用记忆网络存储异常特征模式）。

Result: 在2022年COVID-19疫情的真实物流数据集上，模型在MAE和MSE上分别优于最佳基线12.11%和13.71%。

Conclusion: DeepSTA模型在异常情况下表现出色，解决了数据不足和信息丢失问题，为物流行业提供了有效的预测工具。

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the
logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure
the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical
during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'
delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.
Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many
works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly
model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other
features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous
events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in
these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal
attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we
design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent
neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec
to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks
and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of
couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal
circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a
memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention
mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the
COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by
12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over
multiple competitive baselines.

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk
via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a
significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its
asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert
fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting
and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with
the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest
accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision
(0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI
approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to
elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates
that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed
by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate
clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The
research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning
models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on
the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further
research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of
supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法在跨域数据分布变化和非平稳性下泛化能力不足，CICADA旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: CICADA结合混合专家框架、选择性元学习、自适应扩展算法和分层注意力结构，提升跨域检测性能和可解释性。

Result: 在合成和实际工业数据集上，CICADA在跨域检测性能和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CICADA为跨域时间序列异常检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in
applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant
challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which
are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing
models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and
emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and
Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)
framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility
and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent
negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion
algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical
attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to
enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and
interpretability.

Motivation: 医疗设备风险分类对监管和临床安全至关重要，但现有方法可能无法充分利用多模态信息。

Method: 采用Transformer框架，结合文本和视觉信息，引入交叉注意力捕捉模态间依赖，并使用自训练策略提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 交叉模态注意力和自训练策略能有效提升多模态分类性能，尤其在有限监督下表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies
can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test
instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger
than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed
validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set
dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and
feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,
generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in
coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation
improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety
and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for
training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable
logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss
terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In
this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be
unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show
that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general
approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study
involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is
publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Method: 扩展了现有的单输出Transformer模型，提出了一种多输出Transformer模型，通过广义可解释注意力权重矩阵分析时间相关性和多输出间的相互作用。

Result: 多输出Transformer能够准确预测非线性系统的多输出序列，且不受参数空间维度限制。

Conclusion: 多输出Transformer在预测复杂动力系统输出方面表现出色，同时提供了对输出域空间相关性的解释。

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting
outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input
signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but
also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics
of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing
transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer
that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The
multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original
transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not
only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions
between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation
in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the
sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and
the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Conclusion: DASP方法通过密度感知和变分框架优化，显著提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted
by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state
correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD
state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize
actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its
operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve
this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that
concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their
density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe
decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline
MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

Motivation: 探索稀疏性与可解释性之间的联系，并尝试在模型训练中直接引入可解释性。

Method: 提出动态k-winner-takes-all约束的自剪枝机制，应用于语言Transformer模型。

Result: 自剪枝导致更局部化的电路、集中的特征表示和神经元专业化，且不影响语言建模性能。

Conclusion: 稀疏性与可解释性关系复杂，局部专业化比全局稀疏性更能提升可解释性。

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and
interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate
this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach
dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to
demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike
post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates
interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization
from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing
interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized
circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron
specialization without compromising language modelling performance.
Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that
self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This
reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where
decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization,
leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make
our code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL算法在药物发现中缺乏鲁棒的探索机制，且易导致灾难性遗忘，影响分子有效性。

Method: PSV-PPO在每一步自回归生成时进行部分SMILES验证，评估当前候选标记及所有潜在路径，提前检测无效结构。

Result: 实验表明PSV-PPO显著减少无效结构生成，同时保持探索和优化性能。

Conclusion: PSV-PPO框架可扩展以融入更多领域知识，增强药物发现中的强化学习应用。

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug
discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

Motivation: 由于隐私问题，许多场景无法访问训练数据，而现有测试时适应（TTA）方法存在实例对齐不足、计算复杂和领域遗忘等问题。

Method: 提出了两种算法：LinearTCA和LinearTCA+，前者通过线性变换实现对齐，后者作为插件增强现有TTA方法。

Result: 实验表明，TCA方法在多个任务和数据集上显著优于基线方法，例如在OfficeHome数据集上准确率提升5.88%，同时计算开销极低。

Conclusion: TCA方法通过相关性对齐解决了现有TTA方法的不足，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution
shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a
solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world
scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),
which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA
methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise
alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source
correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,
resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate
the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that
correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can
enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we
propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.
LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and
correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves
as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive
experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods
significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and
backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on
OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%
computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

Conclusion: KnowEEG在性能和可解释性上均表现出色，对医疗等领域有重要意义。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that
shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification
to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep
learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability
remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce
KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.
KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them
using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity
statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model
(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode
connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating
knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,
KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep
learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,
mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG
classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG
provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for
understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open
classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge
about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed
classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.
Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG
explainability is critical such as healthcare.

Method: 提出DFBT方法，直接预测状态而非逐步递归预测，减少误差累积。

Result: DFBT在D4RL数据集和MuJoCo基准测试中显著优于现有方法，预测准确率高。

Conclusion: DFBT通过直接预测状态和减少误差累积，提升了强化学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions
lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of
its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause
the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel
belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT),
directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating
intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT
greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods,
yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline
datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy.
DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step
bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo
benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.
However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models
difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows
training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of
both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we
propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the
product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address
the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix
into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and
utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental
results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across
various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number
of trainable parameters.

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various
industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.
Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational
cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing
research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate
time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular
multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and
missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series
asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with
traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these
challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an
adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to
observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby
enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by
incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT
efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of
inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by
11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in
spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes
to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on
spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable
and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been
increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine
learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our
understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI
has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the
output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.
These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the
reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter
introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based
approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their
integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting
behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use
of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale
geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on
the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new
directions.

TL;DR: GERM是首个针对基因组基础模型（GFMs）的统一对抗攻击基准，提供了全面的评估框架，分析了GFMs的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GFM基准缺乏对抗攻击的全面评估，GERM填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用四种攻击算法和三种防御策略评估五种GFMs的对抗鲁棒性，分析模型架构、量化方案和训练数据的影响。

Result: 基于Transformer的模型比HyenaDNA更具鲁棒性，对抗攻击常针对生物重要区域。

Conclusion: GERM为GFMs的对抗脆弱性提供了系统分析，揭示了模型设计和数据特征的重要性。

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM
offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess
the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate
the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely
adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our
benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM
vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and
training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater
robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the
impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

TL;DR: OmicsCL是一个模块化对比学习框架，用于从多组学数据中无监督学习疾病亚型，通过生存感知对比损失学习与生存相关的表征，并在TCGA BRCA数据集中验证了其临床意义和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动个性化医疗，通过无监督学习从多组学数据中发现疾病亚型。

Method: 提出OmicsCL框架，结合对比学习和生存感知损失，将多组学数据嵌入统一潜在空间。

Result: 在TCGA BRCA数据集中发现临床相关聚类，并验证了生存分层的有效性。

Conclusion: 对比学习在高维异质组学数据中具有发现生物学见解的潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a
significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce
OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds
heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and
miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a
survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn
representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on
labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers
clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance
with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across
hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype
coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating
survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned
embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for
biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

TL;DR: WPO是一种用于连续动作空间强化学习的actor-critic算法，结合了确定性策略梯度和经典策略梯度的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种能够在连续动作空间中高效优化策略的算法，同时避免重参数化技巧的限制。

Method: 通过近似Wasserstein梯度流，在有限维参数空间中推导出简单通用的闭式更新方法。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和磁约束聚变任务中表现优于当前最优的连续控制方法。

Conclusion: WPO是一种高效且通用的连续动作空间强化学习算法。

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm
for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as
an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies
projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a
neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.
The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic
policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits
knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the
action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies
with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the
reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a
magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art
continuous control methods.

TL;DR: MINERVA是一个新的视频推理数据集，旨在解决现有视频基准测试缺乏中间推理步骤的问题，为多模态模型提供详细的手工推理痕迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试仅提供结果监督，无法评估模型是否真正结合了感知和时间信息进行推理，还是仅靠偶然或语言偏见获得正确答案。

Method: 创建MINERVA数据集，包含多模态、多样化的视频问题和详细的推理痕迹，并进行广泛的基准测试和错误分析。

Result: 数据集对前沿开源和专有模型构成挑战，主要错误模式涉及时间定位和视觉感知，而非逻辑或完整性错误。

Conclusion: MINERVA为评估和改进多模态模型的视频推理能力提供了重要工具，数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under
https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva.

Motivation: 正态分布在信息论中具有核心作用，但神经网络中激活值的分布通常未被明确规范。本文旨在利用正态分布的信息论特性，提出一种归一化方法。

Method: 提出正态归一化层，结合幂变换和训练时的高斯噪声，以促进特征表示的正态性。

Result: 实验表明，正态归一化在多种模型和数据集上具有优异的泛化性能，适应性强，并能提升模型对随机扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 正态归一化是一种有效的归一化方法，适用于多种场景，并能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at
the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the
greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an
equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions.
Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of
deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their
effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what
distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved,
been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal
distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality
normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the
feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and
employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments
comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in
regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and
dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of
variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its
suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally
used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also
a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This
context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and
intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the
Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this
implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A
with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system
analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and
allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured
knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We
evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular
Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed
recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas
where AI support can improve visualization design.

*Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法，用于检测和消除多模态模因中的仇恨内容，包括定义引导的提示技术和UnHateMeme框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中多模态模因常被滥用传播仇恨言论，现有研究主要集中在检测而非转化仇恨内容，因此需要开发有效的方法来消除仇恨内容。

Method: 采用定义引导的提示技术检测仇恨模因，并提出UnHateMeme框架，通过替换仇恨文本或视觉组件来转化内容。

Result: VLM在仇恨模因检测任务中表现优异，UnHateMeme框架能有效将仇恨模因转化为非仇恨形式，并保持多模态一致性。

Conclusion: 本文展示了VLM在构建安全网络环境中的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,
VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.
Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a
strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet
human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between
image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the
proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective
strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on
important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online
environments.

TL;DR: AVA是一个基于视频语言模型（VLM）的系统，通过事件知识图谱（EKG）和代理检索生成机制，实现了开放式的视频分析，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析系统局限于预定义任务，无法适应开放式场景，而VLM的上下文窗口限制也阻碍了超长视频的处理。

Method: AVA采用事件知识图谱（EKG）实时索引视频流，并结合代理检索生成机制处理复杂查询。

Result: 在LVBench和VideoMME-Long上分别达到62.3%和64.1%的准确率，在AVA-100上达到75.8%。

Conclusion: AVA在开放式视频分析中表现出色，为超长视频处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an
accuracy of 75.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Pack-PTQ的新型后训练量化方法，通过自适应分组和混合精度量化，解决了现有方法忽略跨块依赖性和低比特精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练量化方法采用块级重建，忽略了跨块依赖性，导致低比特情况下精度显著下降。

Method: 设计了基于Hessian的自适应分组机制，将块划分为非重叠的组作为重建基础单元，并提出混合精度量化方法，根据组的敏感性分配不同比特宽度。

Result: 在2D图像和3D点云分类任务中，实验证明了该方法优于现有后训练量化方法。

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ通过保留跨块依赖性和自适应比特分配，显著提升了低比特量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用多时相影像和NDVI堆栈，结合深度学习模型，提高农田边界划分的准确性和普适性，尤其是在多尺度和地理多样性环境中。

Method: 使用UNET架构的四种深度学习模型，评估多时相影像和NDVI堆栈的组合效果，并在荷兰和巴基斯坦进行迁移学习和独立模型训练。

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for
better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic
segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming
systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and
October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of
Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of
Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP)
vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field
boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with
UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date
images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of
IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack
approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using
pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan.
Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary
data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the
Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide
additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the
season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground
information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and
universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also
highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field
boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to
multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation
in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏对人类健康和环境构成重大风险，但现有方法难以高效准确地检测和分割隐蔽且形状随机的泄漏。

Method: FGSTP算法通过构建相关体积捕捉帧间运动信息，逐步细化对象级特征，并利用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在自建数据集GasVid上的实验表明，FGSTP在分割非刚性物体（如气体泄漏）方面优于其他SOTA模型。

Conclusion: FGSTP算法在气体泄漏分割任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自适应放疗（OART）中，自动轮廓的质量评估对临床决策至关重要，但传统方法依赖大量手动标注或真实轮廓，效率低且成本高。

Method: 开发了贝叶斯序数分类模型，通过校准不确定性阈值优化预测准确性，并在三种数据场景（无标注、少量标注、大量标注）下验证。

Result: 模型在所有场景下表现稳健，仅需30个手动标注即可达到90%以上的测试准确率，校准后93%的轮廓质量预测准确率超过98%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了OART中轮廓评估的效率，减少了手动工作量，并通过不确定性量化确保了放疗流程的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于网格的隐式神经表示（INR）方法在视频应用中参数效率低且比特率高，无法有效捕捉视频的动态特性。

Method: NVTM将视频数据分解为带有流信息的2D网格，支持同时处理时间相关的像素，从而快速学习视频表示。

Result: NVTM在编码速度上比NeRV快3倍以上，PSNR/LPIPS指标显著提升（UVG和MCL-JCV数据集），并在压缩任务中媲美H.264和HEVC标准。

Conclusion: NVTM在视频表示和压缩任务中表现出色，适用于超分辨率、帧插值和视频修复等多种应用。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型生成的帧看起来合理，但运动质量较差，而现有评估方法（如FVD）无法很好地捕捉这一问题。

Method: 通过自动编码点轨迹提取运动特征，用于比较视频分布或评估单个视频的运动质量。

Result: 新方法对合成数据中的时间失真更敏感，能更好地预测人类对生成视频时间一致性和真实性的评价。

Conclusion: 点轨迹表示不仅能改进视频生成评估，还能时空定位生成视频中的不一致性，提供更强的可解释性。

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be

Method: 提出T2I-R1模型，结合双层CoT推理（语义级和令牌级），并引入BiCoT-GRPO方法，通过生成奖励集合协调优化两个层次的CoT。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中分别实现了13%和19%的性能提升，超越了当前最先进的FLUX.1模型。

Conclusion: T2I-R1通过双层CoT推理和强化学习的结合，显著提升了文本到图像生成的性能，为视觉生成领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

*Kwon Byung-Ki,Qi Dai,Lee Hyoseok,Chong Luo,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JointDiT是一种扩散变换器，用于建模RGB和深度的联合分布，通过自适应调度权重和不平衡时间步采样策略，实现高质量的图像和深度图生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于利用扩散变换器的架构优势和图像先验，实现RGB和深度的联合分布建模，以支持多种生成任务。

Method: 提出两种技术：自适应调度权重（根据模态噪声水平调整）和不平衡时间步采样策略，训练模型覆盖所有噪声水平。

Result: JointDiT在联合生成、深度估计和深度条件图像生成任务中表现优异，且联合分布建模可替代条件生成。

Conclusion: JointDiT通过简单有效的技术实现了RGB和深度的联合分布建模，展示了在多种生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional
generation. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResQu的新型超分辨率框架，结合四元数小波预处理和潜在扩散模型，通过动态集成四元数小波嵌入提升图像重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像超分辨率在多个领域有广泛应用，但现有方法在高倍放大时难以平衡感知质量和结构保真度。

Method: 集成四元数小波预处理和潜在扩散模型，引入四元数小波和时间感知编码器，动态嵌入小波信息于去噪过程。

Result: 在多个领域数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法，尤其在感知质量和标准评估指标上。

Conclusion: ResQu框架通过创新设计显著提升了超分辨率效果，代码将在修订后公开。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

TL;DR: BM-MAE是一种针对多模态MRI数据的预训练策略，能够适应任何模态组合，无需单独训练每个组合，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI数据在脑肿瘤诊疗中至关重要，但实际应用中常因模态缺失导致传统方法资源密集且不实用。

Method: 提出BM-MAE，一种掩码图像建模预训练策略，支持灵活适应任何模态组合，无需修改模型架构。

Result: BM-MAE在多个下游任务中表现优于或与基线方法相当，并能高效重建缺失模态。

Conclusion: BM-MAE为多模态MRI数据提供了一种高效且灵活的预训练解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous

results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on
performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these

attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data
augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our
goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to
real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight
Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset,
reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across
10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.

Motivation: 解决单张RGB图像3D人脸重建的挑战，尤其是多样化的表情、视角和种族。

Method: 使用Pixel3DMM（基于视觉变换器）预测像素级几何线索，结合DINO模型特征，优化FLAME拓扑的3DMM参数。

Result: 在几何精度上优于基线方法15%，尤其在表情丰富的面部重建中表现突出。

Conclusion: Pixel3DMM为单图像3D人脸重建提供了高效且高精度的解决方案，尤其在多样化表情和视角下表现优异。

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of
geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知多专家知识蒸馏框架（UMKD），用于解决疾病图像分级中的领域偏移和数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域偏移和数据不平衡导致模型在临床应用中存在偏差，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: UMKD通过浅层和紧凑特征对齐解耦任务无关和任务相关特征，并利用不确定性感知解耦蒸馏机制动态调整知识转移权重。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了UMKD的优越性，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: UMKD为实际疾病图像分级提供了鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德里是全球污染最严重的城市之一，传统静态净化设施因布局不合理和适应性差而效果有限。研究旨在通过AI优化布局，提升空气质量。

Method: 采用近端策略优化（PPO）算法，结合人口密度、交通模式等空间和环境因素，动态学习并优化净化亭布局。

Result: 实验表明，DRL框架在AQI改善、空间覆盖等方面优于随机和贪婪基线方法，实现了均衡高效的净化设施分布。

Conclusion: AI驱动的空间优化在智能城市和空气质量管理中具有潜力，DRL框架为数据驱动的环境治理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on

agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector

Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked
by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and
bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both
classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative
control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum
kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and
the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM
consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or
exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge
regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation,
our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for
multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for
fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena

representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear

Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of
45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures
reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes
per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a
unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the
quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient
solutions to classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems by
harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and

nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we
introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural

Method: 提出了协作微调和全参数训练框架，以及微服务辅助推理架构。

Result: 这些创新框架和应用为6G技术的发展提供了有价值的见解和解决方案。

Conclusion: 边缘大模型在6G中具有广阔的应用前景，但仍需解决资源管理和模型分解等挑战。

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to
solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of
experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and
computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM
emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time
intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence
(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is
featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large
models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.
However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over
wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial
communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of
edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of
edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.
Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training
frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to
enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we

### [164] [Neuroevolution of Self-Attention Over Proto-Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00186)
*Rafael C. Pinto,Anderson R. Tavares*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于原型对象（proto-objects）的注意力机制，替代传统的基于矩形图像块的注意力机制，显著降低了表示复杂性和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于矩形图像块的注意力机制在视觉强化学习任务中表现优异，但存在表示复杂性和计算效率的问题。原型对象作为更高层次的图像特征，可以更高效地编码和处理语义信息。

Method: 利用图像分割技术提取原型对象，将其编码为紧凑的特征向量，并设计了一个更小的自注意力模块来处理这些特征。

Result: 实验表明，基于原型对象的方法在性能上匹配或超越传统方法，同时减少了62%的参数和2.6倍的训练时间。

Conclusion: 原型对象是一种更高效的注意力机制替代方案，能够显著降低计算成本并提升语义信息的处理能力。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

### [165] [A Unifying Framework for Robust and Efficient Inference with Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00282)
*Jacob Carlson,Melissa Dell*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为MARS的框架，用于从非结构化数据中高效、稳健地推断参数，解决了深度学习预测可能引入的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经济学家常使用文本和图像数据进行分析，但深度学习预测可能存在偏差，影响估计结果。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将非结构化数据推断问题重新定义为缺失结构化数据问题，利用深度学习进行填补，并应用半参数推断的经典结果。

Result: 提出了MARS框架，开发了稳健高效的估计器，适用于描述性和因果性估计，并在实际研究中验证了其价值。

Conclusion: MARS为使用非结构化数据的推断提供了统一且实用的解决方案，填补了现有文献的空白。

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust
inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,
images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from
texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with
advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not
generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to
estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe
inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where
structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural
networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from
semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators
based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At
Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends
existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,
linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.
We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal
estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and
transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to
common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing
literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,
demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构计量经济学模型的估计通常计算成本高且耗时，研究者希望开发一种预训练估计器，以简化后续应用。

Method: 利用神经网络识别结构模型的参数，并以一个难以估计的序列搜索模型为例进行预训练。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上测试，估计器运行速度快且准确率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的现成估计器可以提高结构模型的可访问性，促进研究和实践应用。

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The
estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost
and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.
Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little
computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net
to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial
trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model
that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator
on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high
accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,
pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible
to researchers and practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NQS在复杂量子多体系统中表现出高精度预测能力，但其计算成本高昂，且难以推广到大规模系统和多样化参数范围。

Method: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的课程学习框架，并结合Pairing-Net架构，通过扰动视角将先验物理知识融入学习过程。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法实现了约200倍的计算加速，并在优化稳定性上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效探索量子多体系统的参数空间提供了新思路，并展示了迁移学习和课程学习的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled
high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as
strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains
prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction
strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning
has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to
large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on
transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration
across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by
interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate
how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum
learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically
implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and
empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately
200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization
stability compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: 结合机器学习、密度泛函理论和微动力学模型，为复杂反应催化剂设计提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in
computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the
high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for
predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the
Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to
predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can
significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on
scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further
benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of
WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data
and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)
predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.
Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that
the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to
scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy
predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to
screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work
highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and
microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,
providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Motivation: 在高保真动态系统需要重复评估且缺乏控制方程的情况下，数据驱动的降阶技术更适用。

Method: 使用POD将高保真解表示为参数特定的线性子空间，提出子空间距离度量作为主动学习的指导机制。

Result: 成功扩展了两种非侵入式降阶建模方法，并在两个参数化物理模型中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的SDE-AL框架在参数化降阶建模中表现出高效性。

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to
be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in
absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model
reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning
approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by
greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter
domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of
high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The
high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific
linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to
perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance
measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with
different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The
usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)
framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive
reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven
(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.
Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,
highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交活动数据（如搜索量和传染病数据）的高维性和时变动态性使其建模和预测具有挑战性。

Method: D-Tracker将偏微分方程融入张量分解框架，自动捕捉趋势、季节性和兴趣扩散等时变模式。

Result: 实验表明，D-Tracker在预测精度和计算时间上优于现有方法，并能提取地点间的兴趣扩散。

Conclusion: D-Tracker是一种高效且可解释的方法，适用于社交活动数据流的建模和预测。

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes
and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples'
interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from
such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and
forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are
high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends,
seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a
method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social
activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed
method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the
partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and
captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and
interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic:
it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully
automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent
of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained
from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data
Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less
computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion
between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过量化和降维优化检索增强生成模型中的高维向量嵌入存储问题，发现float8量化和PCA结合能显著减少存储需求且性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维向量嵌入（float32精度）在检索增强生成模型中存储需求大，亟需优化以减少内存占用。

Method: 在MTEB基准上系统评估了量化（float16、int8、binary、float8）和降维（PCA、Kernel PCA、UMAP、Random Projections、Autoencoders）策略。

Result: float8量化实现4倍存储压缩且性能损失<0.3%，优于int8；PCA是最佳降维方法。结合50%维度的PCA与float8可实现8倍压缩且性能影响更小。

Conclusion: 提出一种可视化性能-存储权衡空间的方法，帮助用户根据内存限制选择最优配置。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG基准主要基于公共数据（如Wikipedia），缺乏对私有和个人化数据的支持，限制了RAG在企业和隐私敏感场景的应用。

Method: 通过构建EnronQA数据集（包含103,638封邮件和528,304个问答对），为私有数据提供更真实的RAG评估环境。

Result: EnronQA为私有数据的RAG提供了更好的基准，并支持个性化检索设置的实验。

Conclusion: EnronQA填补了私有数据RAG评估的空白，并探索了在私有文档推理中记忆与检索的权衡。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在零样本任务中表现优异，但在未见过的任务和领域中性能下降，主要原因是词汇和词分布的差异。

Conclusion: Task Arithmetic是一种有效的零样本学习和模型适应策略，同时提供了对其优势和局限性的深入分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for
zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at

Result: 实验表明ChebyCF在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理速度较快。

Conclusion: ChebyCF通过图谱滤波有效解决了传统方法的瓶颈，实现了先进的推荐性能。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative
filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks
in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent
space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially
valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is
limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a
fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these
limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum
and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a
CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,
it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of
signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively
approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by
using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through
extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned
bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 任务复杂性高，现有方法（包括SOTA推理模型）实用性不足，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and
the need for further research in this area. Code and dataset are available at

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Conclusion: 本文为开发下一代PD识别系统提供了指导，通过多模态方法和前沿机器学习技术，推动PD诊断的进步和患者护理的创新。

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan
Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is
crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition,
existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities
and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these

### [179] [Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00643)
*Merve Gülle,Sebastian Weingärtner,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的外体积去除（OVR）方法，通过深度学习模型消除实时动态MRI中的伪影，提高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时动态MRI在捕捉快速生理过程中具有重要作用，但高加速率下易产生伪影，影响图像质量。

Method: 使用时间交错欠采样模式的复合时间图像估计外体积信号，训练深度学习模型去除伪影，并结合物理驱动的DL方法进行重建。

Result: 在高加速率下，图像质量与临床基线图像相当，且优于传统重建技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时动态MRI中的伪影减少提供了实用有效的解决方案，无需修改采集过程。

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

### [180] [Evaluating the AI-Lab Intervention: Impact on Student Perception and Use of Generative AI in Early Undergraduate Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00100)
*Ethan Dickey,Andres Bejarano,Rhianna Kuperus,Bárbara Fagundes*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结构化干预（AI-Lab）对生成式AI（GenAI）在计算机科学教育中应用的影响，发现其能提升学生的舒适度和开放性，同时促进更审慎的工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的应用日益增多，但其对学生学习、技能发展和认知的影响尚未充分研究，尤其是如何通过结构化引导避免过度依赖。

Method: 在普渡大学的四门课程中引入AI-Lab模块，收集831份匹配的干预前后调查数据，并结合焦点小组讨论，采用混合方法分析。

Result: GenAI使用频率稳定，但在调试和作业问题上的舒适度显著提升，学生使用方式更审慎。焦点小组证实干预帮助学生更反思地整合AI工具。

Conclusion: 结构化干预能帮助学生有效利用GenAI而不损害核心能力，为教育者提供了基于证据的建议，并指明未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its
effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain
underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on
structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines
the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided
scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data
Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering
courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and
elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey
responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods
approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as
well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming
projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and
openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage
patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting
students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions
corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap"
between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools
into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill
development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable
students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential
competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to
integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for
future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了将心理学理论应用于大型语言模型（LLMs）的六个关键维度，包括评估工具、数据集、评估指标、实证发现、人格模拟方法和行为模拟，并指出了当前方法的优缺点及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心任务中的广泛应用，评估其心理特质对于理解其社会影响和确保AI的可信对齐至关重要。现有研究未系统讨论心理学测试、LLM专用数据集及其应用。

Method: 系统回顾了六个维度：评估工具、LLM专用数据集、评估指标（一致性和稳定性）、实证发现、人格模拟方法和行为模拟。

Result: 部分LLMs在特定提示方案下表现出可复现的人格模式，但在任务和设置中存在显著变异性。现有方法存在心理学工具与LLM能力不匹配等问题。

Conclusion: 研究提出了未来方向，以开发更具可解释性、稳健性和泛化性的LLM心理评估框架。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据依赖算法系统在更多生活领域产生影响，个体需要通过集体行动来维护自身利益并问责算法。研究多集体行为的互动效应是必要的。

Method: 引入了一个研究多集体行为的框架，并通过语言模型分类器和推荐系统进行实验，分析不同目标、策略、大小和异质性对集体效能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，集体间的互动会显著降低单个集体的效能（高达75%），且在推荐系统中，集体大小的影响大于异质性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了算法透明度和集体行为多样性的重要性，为集体利用数据维护利益提供了框架。

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more
domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and
hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence,
individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that
engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,
membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we
introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two
or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven
systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected
interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with
language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives
each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how
differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a
collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between
collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be
able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for
themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts
simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We
find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor
fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that
heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results
signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models
and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these
systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system
developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use
their own data to promote their own interests.

Abstract: Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) matrices are a family of parameterized
lower-triangular matrices that play an important role in streaming differential
privacy with correlated noise. Our main result is a BLT inversion theorem: the
inverse of a BLT matrix is itself a BLT matrix with different parameters. We
also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the
parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original
BLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of
BLT parameters for privacy mechanisms through automatic differentiation.

Method: 使用DeepMIMO模拟器生成数据集，采用FGSM方法进行对抗攻击，比较二进制分类器（如LightGBM）的效果，并分析回归模型的MSE和R2指标变化。

Result: FGSM攻击导致MSE增加33%，R2下降10%；LightGBM分类器检测对抗异常数据的准确率达98%。

Conclusion: 回归模型易受对抗攻击影响，但快速分析网络流量和数据可有效识别恶意活动。

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an
analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial
attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A
comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of
detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of
the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,
during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is
shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an
increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2
indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively
identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression
machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid
analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it
possible to identify malicious activity

Result: 在功率约束下实现满意的分类精度，且多跳数增加可提高精度。

Conclusion: 该框架在多跳MIMO网络中有效，适用于受限功率条件下的机器学习任务。

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate
fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by
carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural
network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with
the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the
corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train
PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification
error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,
with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then
obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block
extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that
the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory
classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that
higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of
hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Conclusion: MI技术为神经网络的因果推断提供了更透明的分析框架，有助于理解其优势和局限性。

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in
bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical
statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While
Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex
biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for
validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations
learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI
techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the
internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance
functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)
discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the
network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how
confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for
comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,
machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their
respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces
major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task
planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in
response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task
requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper
proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV
swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs)
is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting
them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target
tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV
motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of
emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted
across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to
dynamic changes.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂交通环境下的主动安全分析提供了系统性方法，显著提升了安全感知能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis
framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the
framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient
considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a
hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of
ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives
vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic
ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety
measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the
framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order
Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted
high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent
maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against
traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on
highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for
active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception
in complex traffic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了移动机器人在动态环境中的导航能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured
environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to
dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework
consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an
adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and
improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed
approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world
hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on
flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.
Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the
controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating
enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or
manual tuning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COIL（成本最优交互学习）是一种多任务交互规划器，通过策略性地选择三种查询类型（技能、偏好和帮助）来最小化人类在任务序列中的努力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作机器人需要持续适应新任务和用户偏好，同时不过度依赖用户。现有方法通常局限于单任务场景，不适合持续的多任务协作。

Method: COIL将问题建模为无容量限制设施选址（UFL）问题，在多项式时间内实现近似最优规划。针对用户偏好不确定性，引入一步信念空间规划。

Result: 模拟和物理实验表明，COIL显著减少了人类的工作量，同时保持任务成功完成。

Conclusion: COIL为多任务协作中的高效人机交互提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedEMA的新框架，通过融合当前和历史的联邦学习模型，解决了自动驾驶模型在动态环境中的时间性灾难性遗忘问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中部署时，联邦学习模型面临时间性灾难性遗忘问题，导致历史知识丢失。

Method: 提出FedEMA框架，包括服务器端的历史拟合能力保留和车辆端的负熵正则化，以平衡模型的泛化性和适应性。

Result: 在Cityscapes和Camvid数据集上，FedEMA的mIoU比现有方法高出7.12%。

Conclusion: FedEMA通过双目标优化有效解决了时间性灾难性遗忘问题，提升了自动驾驶模型的性能。

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex
task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically
face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models
through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models
face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically
evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of
historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average
(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral
innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation
via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL
round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative
entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to
EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a
dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and
adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the
proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid
dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing
7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Motivation: 现有方法在生成安全关键交通场景时，常因物理合理性不足和生成效率低而产生不现实场景，影响了自动驾驶系统的评估效果。

Method: 使用基于图的变分自编码器（VAE）学习紧凑的潜在空间，结合扩散模型进行去噪生成真实轨迹；引入新的引导目标实现可控和对抗性场景生成；开发基于物理可行性检查的样本选择模块。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在对抗性效果和生成效率上优于现有基线，同时保持了高度的真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键场景仿真提供了有效工具，有助于更鲁棒的自动驾驶系统评估。

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating
autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,
existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient
consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion
model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial
safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a
graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that
captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational
efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the
denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and
adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that
drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally
realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module
based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical
plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness
and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a
high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic
safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation
of autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 弹性变形物体操纵（DOM）因物体自由度无限且观测部分密集，导致状态空间大、采样复杂性和策略学习不确定性高。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示学习（INR）重建完整隐式表面（如符号距离函数），并通过强化学习进行表示微调，以高效获取可操纵策略。

Conclusion: INR-DOM通过结合隐式表示与强化学习，成功解决了弹性变形物体在部分观测条件下的操纵问题。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly
elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation
(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited
degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial
observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling
complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a
novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called
INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with
partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit
surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform
exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that
enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while
efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative
analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation
studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm. Videos are available at

Result: 在五个仿真环境中验证，STL满足率优于基线，推理速度快10-100倍，适用于任意系统动力学。

Conclusion: TeLoGraF能高效解决复杂STL问题，对分布外STL规范具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most
previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to
the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal
logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,
Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,
verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research
domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon
this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our
application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively
transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution
monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding
drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose
a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network
controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show
that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition
benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying
such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose
a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate
formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results
suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and
robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited
in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle
and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,
which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will
enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's
lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Conclusion: ParkDiffusion通过创新方法解决了自动停车场景中的多模态轨迹预测问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.

Conclusion: RoVI和VIEW为机器人任务提供了一种高效的视觉指令解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and
Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了高负载下传统方法的资源分配瓶颈，为微服务系统的智能调度提供了实用价值。

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task
concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource
scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The
scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and
value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation
under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous
multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel
sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design
improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the
experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling
scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches
across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success
rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the
proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in
multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource
allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load,
demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice
systems.

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of
pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain
understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered
analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual
protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse
linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated
anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and
Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.
Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error
rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination
and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot
(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%
zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:
p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization
consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with
pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native
listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners
(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization
(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,
human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical
utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,
disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy
while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic
utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Conclusion: SA-GAT-SR为计算材料科学提供了新范式，平衡了预测精度与物理可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in
reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured
confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy
evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and
assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel
identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value
for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this
identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a
policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that
maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound
of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world
application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methodology.

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental
challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized
medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning
has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible
effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many
covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a
phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the
outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In
medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways
frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,
we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the
CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We
use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that
can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In
settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables
more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false
discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for
hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is
strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently
compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature
effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for
these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.
We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free
discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley
values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at
the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes
marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the
validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our
machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several
effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction
effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

Conclusion: 本文为多敏感特征下的公平分类提供了理论框架和实用算法，扩展了现有研究的适用范围。

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers
a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined
by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the
Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general
approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We
show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,
including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and
Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific
groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become
instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these
group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware
and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions
like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for
Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We
show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.

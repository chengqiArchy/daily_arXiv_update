### [1] [Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and Attack-Defense Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01456)
*Vaidehi Patil,Yi-Lin Sung,Peter Hase,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多模态遗忘基准UnLOK-VQA，用于评估从多模态大语言模型中删除敏感信息的效果，并展示了多模态攻击的优越性和有效的防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型可能无意中学习敏感信息，而现有遗忘研究主要集中在文本领域，多模态遗忘尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入UnLOK-VQA基准和攻防框架，扩展视觉问答数据集，生成多样化样本，并评估六种防御目标对抗七种攻击。

Result: 多模态攻击优于纯文本或图像攻击，最有效的防御策略是从内部模型状态中删除答案信息，且更大模型表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UnLOK-VQA为多模态遗忘研究提供了严格基准，表明模型规模有助于提升安全性。

Abstract: LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive
information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk
is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from
multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge
through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how
effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning)
necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs.
While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal
unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as
an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific
multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset
using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for
testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for
maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven
attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method
leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal
attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective
defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally,
larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale
enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing
unlearning in MLLMs.

### [2] [MoxE: Mixture of xLSTM Experts with Entropy-Aware Routing for Efficient Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01459)
*Abdoul Majid O. Thiombiano,Brahim Hnich,Ali Ben Mrad,Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoxE结合xLSTM与MoE框架，通过熵感知路由和辅助损失，显著提升大语言模型的效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在可扩展性和效率方面的关键挑战。

Method: 结合xLSTM和MoE，引入熵感知路由机制和辅助损失函数。

Result: 显著提升效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoxE为可扩展的大语言模型架构提供了重要进展。

Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically
combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of
Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency
challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively
leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing
sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the
heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to
dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and
balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture
to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being
favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce
a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing
losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical
analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves
significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing
approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

### [3] [SymPlanner: Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479)
*Siheng Xiong,Jieyu Zhou,Zhangding Liu,Yusen Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymPlanner是一个结合语言模型与符号环境的新框架，通过迭代修正和对比排名提升规划能力，优于纯自然语言基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在多步规划任务中的局限性，特别是在需要基于外部约束生成连贯动作序列的场景。

Method: SymPlanner通过符号环境作为显式世界模型，结合迭代修正（IC）和对比排名（CR）优化规划过程。

Result: 在PlanBench上验证，SymPlanner生成的规划更连贯、多样且可验证。

Conclusion: SymPlanner通过符号环境与语言模型的结合，显著提升了规划任务的性能。

Abstract: Planning remains a core challenge for language models (LMs), particularly in
domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external
constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with
structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic
environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely
on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a
symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic
environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance
exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC),
which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the
symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward
valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained
comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate
SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse,
and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.

### [4] [On the effectiveness of Large Language Models in the mechanical design domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01559)
*Daniele Grandi,Fabian Riquelme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在机械工程领域的性能，通过ABC数据集中的语义数据设计了两项无监督任务，并在任务中取得了一定成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在机械工程领域的表现，利用语义数据评估模型性能。

Method: 使用ABC数据集的语义数据，设计了两项无监督任务：二元句子对分类任务和零样本分类任务，并通过调整学习率、dropout值、序列长度和添加多头注意力层来优化模型。

Result: 二元句子对分类任务准确率为0.62，零样本分类任务准确率为0.386，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在该领域学习语言时的特定失败模式，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In this work, we seek to understand the performance of large language models
in the mechanical engineering domain. We leverage the semantic data found in
the ABC dataset, specifically the assembly names that designers assigned to the
overall assemblies, and the individual semantic part names that were assigned
to each part. After pre-processing the data we developed two unsupervised tasks
to evaluate how different model architectures perform on domain-specific data:
a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task.
We achieved a 0.62 accuracy for the binary sentence-pair classification task
with a fine-tuned model that focuses on fighting over-fitting: 1) modifying
learning rates, 2) dropout values, 3) Sequence Length, and 4) adding a
multi-head attention layer. Our model on the zero-shot classification task
outperforms the baselines by a wide margin, and achieves a top-1 classification
accuracy of 0.386. The results shed some light on the specific failure modes
that arise when learning from language in this domain.

### [5] [AI agents may be worth the hype but not the resources (yet): An initial exploration of machine translation quality and costs in three language pairs in the legal and news domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01560)
*Vicent Briva Iglesias,Gokhan Dogru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了五种机器翻译范式，发现传统NMT在自动评分中表现最佳，而增强推理的LLM在人工评估中更优，但多智能体工作流成本高昂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM和多智能体编排在机器翻译中的实际效果，明确其相对于传统NMT的优势与不足。

Method: 对五种范式（Google Translate、GPT-4o、o1-preview及两种GPT-4o驱动的智能体工作流）进行自动和人工评估，覆盖三种语言对。

Result: NMT在自动评分中领先，o1-preview在人工评估中表现最佳，但多智能体工作流成本显著更高。

Conclusion: 建议多维、成本感知的评估协议，并指出优化方向如轻量级协调策略和混合流程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent orchestration are touted as the
next leap in machine translation (MT), but their benefits relative to
conventional neural MT (NMT) remain unclear. This paper offers an empirical
reality check. We benchmark five paradigms, Google Translate (strong NMT
baseline), GPT-4o (general-purpose LLM), o1-preview (reasoning-enhanced LLM),
and two GPT-4o-powered agentic workflows (sequential three-stage and iterative
refinement), on test data drawn from a legal contract and news prose in three
English-source pairs: Spanish, Catalan and Turkish. Automatic evaluation is
performed with COMET, BLEU, chrF2 and TER; human evaluation is conducted with
expert ratings of adequacy and fluency; efficiency with total input-plus-output
token counts mapped to April 2025 pricing.
  Automatic scores still favour the mature NMT system, which ranks first in
seven of twelve metric-language combinations; o1-preview ties or places second
in most remaining cases, while both multi-agent workflows trail. Human
evaluation reverses part of this narrative: o1-preview produces the most
adequate and fluent output in five of six comparisons, and the iterative agent
edges ahead once, indicating that reasoning layers capture semantic nuance
undervalued by surface metrics. Yet these qualitative gains carry steep costs.
The sequential agent consumes roughly five times, and the iterative agent
fifteen times, the tokens used by NMT or single-pass LLMs.
  We advocate multidimensional, cost-aware evaluation protocols and highlight
research directions that could tip the balance: leaner coordination strategies,
selective agent activation, and hybrid pipelines combining single-pass LLMs
with targeted agent intervention.

### [6] [PIPA: A Unified Evaluation Protocol for Diagnosing Interactive Planning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01592)
*Takyoung Kim,Janvijay Singh,Shuhaib Mehri,Emre Can Acikgoz,Sagnik Mukherjee,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Sumuk Shashidhar,Gokhan Tur,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PIPA评估协议，通过POMDP框架全面评估任务规划代理的行为过程，强调用户满意度不仅取决于任务完成，还包括中间行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要基于任务完成评估代理性能，忽视了用户对整个代理过程的体验，导致与用户满意度脱节。

Method: 提出PIPA协议，将交互式任务规划代理的行为过程建模为POMDP，通过原子评估标准全面诊断代理决策管道的优缺点。

Result: 分析表明代理在不同行为阶段表现各异，用户满意度受结果和中间行为共同影响。

Conclusion: PIPA为代理评估提供更全面的视角，未来可探索多代理系统和用户模拟器的局限性。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with
numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially
prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as
context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However,
existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task
completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely
improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as
users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To
address this gap, we propose PIPA, a unified evaluation protocol that
conceptualizes the behavioral process of interactive task planning agents
within a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) paradigm. The
proposed protocol offers a comprehensive assessment of agent performance
through a set of atomic evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and
practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's
decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different
behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and
intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems
that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task
planning.

### [7] [Always Tell Me The Odds: Fine-grained Conditional Probability Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01595)
*Liaoyaqi Wang,Zhengping Jiang,Anqi Liu,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于细粒度概率估计的先进模型，解决了大语言模型在不确定或部分信息下概率预测不准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在完整信息任务中表现优异，但在不确定或部分信息下的概率预测仍存在偏差和粗糙问题。

Result: 在依赖条件概率估计的任务中，新方法显著优于现有微调和提示方法。

Conclusion: 新模型在概率估计任务中表现优异，为不确定性问题提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation
of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities,
particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs
continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic
predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating
uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable
estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM
probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent
numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and
assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set
of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic
evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and
show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and
prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators,
and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and
agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model
repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching
have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it
hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines
have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into
service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference
engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25
open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine
in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support,
scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation.
Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by
investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess
the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the
performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research
directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of
various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to
researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference
engines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments
in this fast-evolving field:

*Brian Wong,Kaito Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DeBERTa-RAD框架，结合LLM伪标记和DeBERTa知识蒸馏，高效准确标注胸部X光报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光报告的自由文本复杂性高，传统NLP方法难以处理，LLM直接应用又效率不足。

Method: 两阶段框架：先用LLM生成高质量伪标签，再用DeBERTa-Base模型通过知识蒸馏训练。

Result: 在MIMIC-500基准测试中，Macro F1得分0.9120，优于现有方法，且推理速度快。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和高效学生模型，可突破数据标注瓶颈，实现高性能医学文本处理。

Abstract: Automated labeling of chest X-ray reports is essential for enabling
downstream tasks such as training image-based diagnostic models, population
health studies, and clinical decision support. However, the high variability,
complexity, and prevalence of negation and uncertainty in these free-text
reports pose significant challenges for traditional Natural Language Processing
methods. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text
understanding, their direct application for large-scale, efficient labeling is
limited by computational cost and speed. This paper introduces DeBERTa-RAD, a
novel two-stage framework that combines the power of state-of-the-art LLM
pseudo-labeling with efficient DeBERTa-based knowledge distillation for
accurate and fast chest X-ray report labeling. We leverage an advanced LLM to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels, including certainty statuses, for a large
corpus of reports. Subsequently, a DeBERTa-Base model is trained on this
pseudo-labeled data using a tailored knowledge distillation strategy. Evaluated
on the expert-annotated MIMIC-500 benchmark, DeBERTa-RAD achieves a
state-of-the-art Macro F1 score of 0.9120, significantly outperforming
established rule-based systems, fine-tuned transformer models, and direct LLM
inference, while maintaining a practical inference speed suitable for
high-throughput applications. Our analysis shows particular strength in
handling uncertain findings. This work demonstrates a promising path to
overcome data annotation bottlenecks and achieve high-performance medical text
processing through the strategic combination of LLM capabilities and efficient
student models trained via distillation.

### [10] [Efficient Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform Pruning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01731)
*Chuan Sun,Han Yu,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的非均匀剪枝方法（SVNUP），通过量化各Transformer层对模型性能的贡献，为不同层分配定制化的剪枝预算，显著提升了剪枝模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统层间均匀剪枝方法未考虑不同Transformer层的重要性差异，导致性能不理想。因此，需要一种非均匀剪枝方法以保留关键参数。

Method: 提出SVNUP方法，利用Shapley值量化各层贡献，并设计滑动窗口近似计算Shapley值以减少计算开销。

Result: 在LLaMA-v1、LLaMA-v2和OPT等模型上的实验表明，SVNUP在70%稀疏度下比SparseGPT降低困惑度（PPL）18.01%（LLaMA-7B）和19.55%（LLaMA-13B）。

Conclusion: SVNUP通过非均匀剪枝显著提升剪枝模型性能，为大型语言模型的高效压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing
model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance.
Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach
across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying
significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being
accounted for. To this end, we propose the \underline{S}hapley
\underline{V}alue-based \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{P}runing
(\methodname{}) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of
each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the
assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical
parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based
Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational
overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning
significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, \methodname{}
achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01\% and 19.55\% on LLaMA-7B and
LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70\% sparsity.

### [11] [Same evaluation, more tokens: On the effect of input length for machine translation evaluation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01761)
*Tobias Domhan,Dawei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，文本长度显著影响基于LLM的翻译质量评估，导致长文本错误标注减少和系统排名准确性下降。通过优化提示策略和微调方法，可以缓解这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估机器翻译文本，尤其是长文档翻译，是一个长期挑战。研究探讨LLM是否能够通过输入完整文档进行评估，并保持评估结果的一致性。

Method: 研究分析了文本长度对评估的影响，并测试了多种策略，包括粒度对齐提示、聚焦句子提示（FSP）和微调方法。

Result: 长文本导致错误标注减少和系统排名准确性下降。FSP和微调方法显著缓解了这种长度偏差。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示策略和微调方法，LLM可以更可靠地用于长文档翻译质量评估。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating machine-translated text remains a long-standing
challenge, particularly for long documents. Recent work has shown that large
language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable and interpretable sentence-level
translation evaluators via MQM error span annotations. With modern LLMs
supporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed
entire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally,
evaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans
regardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length
significantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and
reduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate
several strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence
Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the
evaluation task. The latter two methods largely mitigate this length bias,
making LLMs more reliable for long-form translation evaluation.

Method: 采用模糊逻辑和语言现象模型，结合多模态分析（如面部表情和手势识别），开发工具评估决策能力、沟通和创造力等软技能。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能有效整合多源数据，生成一致且有意义的软技能评估结果，多模态整合显著提升了评分质量。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了软技能评估的透明度和可理解性，为教育利益相关者提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the unbiased assessment of
soft skills is a significant challenge, particularly in higher education. This
paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model
of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in
undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach
enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing
nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent
uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments
were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses
soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool
identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial
expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework
effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and
consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple
modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of
soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable
to educational stakeholders.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent
need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational
settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has
demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning
classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this
study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis
with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to
distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research
specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such
as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and
metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique
psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing. Through the intersection of
computational linguistics and cognitive science, this framework contributes to
the development of reliable tools aimed at preserving academic integrity in the
era of generative AI.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information
("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream
tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context
learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning
remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet
plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries,
leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose
correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news.
We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context
learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a
suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and
Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into
the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2
Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance
across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our
results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves
models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the
$\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in
context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news.
Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

### [15] [Intra-Layer Recurrence in Transformers for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01855)
*Anthony Nguyen,Wenjun Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Intra-Layer Recurrence（ILR）的方法，通过选择性在单个前向传递中对特定层应用循环，优化了Transformer模型的参数增长问题。实验表明，早期层分配更多迭代效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自然语言处理中表现出色，但其深度的增加导致参数数量大幅增长。现有方法通常对整个层块无差别地应用循环，缺乏针对性。

Method: 提出Intra-Layer Recurrence（ILR），在单个前向传递中仅对特定层选择性应用循环，而非整个层块。

Result: 实验结果显示，早期层分配更多迭代能够取得最佳效果。

Conclusion: ILR为优化Transformer架构中的循环结构提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language
processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in
parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this
issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence
indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate
Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence
selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments
show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results.
These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing
recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BERT的NER框架，通过位置注意力机制和预训练参数实现高效定制，减少训练成本并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT在NER任务中表现优异，但从头微调成本高且耗时，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 集成位置注意力机制，利用预训练参数进行定制化，减少训练时间。

Result: 在Kaggle数据集上表现优异，训练周期更少。

Conclusion: 提供了一种降低BERT-NER训练成本且保持高准确性的实用方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) leveraging
the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model in
natural language processing (NLP). NER is a fundamental task in NLP with broad
applicability across downstream applications. While BERT has established itself
as a state-of-the-art model for entity recognition, fine-tuning it from scratch
for each new application is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To
address this, we propose a cost-efficient approach that integrates positional
attention mechanisms into the entity recognition process and enables effective
customization using pre-trained parameters. The framework is evaluated on a
Kaggle dataset derived from the Groningen Meaning Bank corpus and achieves
strong performance with fewer training epochs. This work contributes to the
field by offering a practical solution for reducing the training cost of
BERT-based NER systems while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过即时反馈，个体可以学会准确区分人类书写与AI生成的文本，并调整自我感知能力。反馈组在准确性和信心校准上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨个体能否通过反馈学习区分人类与AI生成的文本，并研究其依赖的判断标准，如文本风格和可读性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成文本，与人类文本对比，让255名参与者随机分配至反馈组或无反馈组，记录准确性、信心水平等数据。

Result: 反馈组在准确性和信心校准上表现更好，纠正了对AI文本风格的误解。无反馈组在信心最高时错误最多。

Conclusion: 通过针对性训练和反馈，个体可以有效区分人类与AI文本，并改善自我评估能力，这对教育领域尤为重要。

Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately
discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with
immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their
self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals
rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived
readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and
text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written
texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who
identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated.
Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate
feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment
completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response
times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and
participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in
accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect
assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about
stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants
made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely
resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be
effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which
helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as
well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating
more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in
educational contexts.

to support exploration of sentiment trends and topic distributions across time
and regions. This work contributes a scalable methodology for social media
analysis in dynamic geopolitical contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMOUFLAGE是一种基于LLM的两代理系统，通过迭代优化攻击提示，生成语义等效但能误导证据检索和比较的对抗性改写，成功绕过基于证据的虚假信息检测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒文本对抗攻击方法不适用于基于证据的虚假信息检测系统，因其无法破坏系统的多组件结构（检索和比较模块）。

Method: CAMOUFLAGE采用两代理系统（提示优化代理和攻击代理），通过迭代优化生成对抗性改写，无需依赖分类器logits或大量查询。

Result: 在四个系统上测试，平均攻击成功率为46.92%，同时保持文本连贯性和语义等效性。

Conclusion: CAMOUFLAGE展示了对抗性攻击在多组件虚假信息检测系统中的有效性，为系统安全性提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the
veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their
adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks
are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these
attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or
logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the
multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate
both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to
break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws
incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach
that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker
Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence
retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the
system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces
semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the
Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the
prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger
structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level
substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes.
Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on
binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for
classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four
systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an
average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and
semantic equivalence to the original claims.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文化理论的Social Worldview Taxonomy（SWT）框架，用于衡量大语言模型（LLMs）的社会认知态度，并通过实验揭示了这些模型对社交线索的响应模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs如何隐式形成和表达社会认知态度（如权威、平等、自主和命运），填补现有研究在更广泛社会维度上的空白。

Method: 方法包括引入SWT框架，将四种典型世界观（等级制、平等主义、个人主义、宿命论）转化为可测量的子维度，并对28种LLMs进行实证分析。

Result: 研究发现LLMs具有可解释的认知特征，且社交线索能系统性影响这些态度，揭示了普遍模式和模型特异性差异。

Conclusion: 结论是SWT框架增强了LLMs的可解释性，揭示了其隐含的社会认知偏见及对社交反馈的响应，为开发更透明、社会责任感更强的语言技术提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, widely
adopted in communication, decision-making, and information retrieval, raising
critical questions about how these systems implicitly form and express
socio-cognitive attitudes or "worldviews". While existing research extensively
addresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes
toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this
paper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework
grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews
(Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable
sub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable
cognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social
Referencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues
systematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response
patterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the
interpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their
responsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more
transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络信息（如科学文献和维基百科）超出用户阅读水平的问题，提升信息的可访问性。

Method: 采用自优化方法开发LLM的文本简化能力，并通过4563名参与者的随机对照实验，比较原始文本与简化文本的理解效果。

Result: 简化文本显著提高了用户的多选题正确率（绝对提升3.9%），尤其在生物医学领域效果最显著（14.6%）。

Conclusion: LLM的文本简化能力有助于提升复杂信息的理解度，为更广泛的用户提供专业知识的学习工具。

Abstract: Information on the web, such as scientific publications and Wikipedia, often
surpasses users' reading level. To help address this, we used a self-refinement
approach to develop a LLM capability for minimally lossy text simplification.
To validate our approach, we conducted a randomized study involving 4563
participants and 31 texts spanning 6 broad subject areas: PubMed (biomedical
scientific articles), biology, law, finance, literature/philosophy, and
aerospace/computer science. Participants were randomized to viewing original or
simplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text. The participants were also
asked to provide qualitative feedback such as task difficulty. Our results
indicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs
correctly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute
increase, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more
moderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science
(3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%). Notably, the results were robust to whether
participants could refer back to the text while answering MCQs. The absolute
accuracy decreased by up to ~9% for both original and simplified setups where
participants could not refer back to the text, but the ~4% overall improvement
persisted. Finally, participants' self-reported perceived ease based on a
simplified NASA Task Load Index was greater for those who read the simplified
text (absolute change on a 5-point scale 0.33, p<0.05). This randomized study,
involving an order of magnitude more participants than prior works,
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to make complex information easier to
understand. Our work aims to enable a broader audience to better learn and make
use of expert knowledge available on the web, improving information
accessibility.

Conclusion: 该研究为减少LLMs中的有害内容提供了工具和见解，有助于提升LLM应用的伦理性和安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world
applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4,
and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data
essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain
harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives.
Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors,
spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine
trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use.
This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across
these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful
webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a
prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and
a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for content filtering. Additionally, we
create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide
crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. Upon
publishing, we will also opensource our model signal on the entire C4 dataset.
Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a
resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Result: 目前多为原型或部分实现，完整解决方案稀缺，但AI的进步有望推动CALL发展。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为CALL开发者提供AI方法视角，并促进跨学科合作。

Abstract: Computer-assisted language learning -- CALL -- is an established research
field. We review how artificial intelligence can be applied to support language
learning and teaching. The need for intelligent agents that assist language
learners and teachers is increasing: the human teacher's time is a scarce and
costly resource, which does not scale with growing demand. Further factors
contribute to the need for CALL: pandemics and increasing demand for distance
learning, migration of large populations, the need for sustainable and
affordable support for learning, etc. CALL systems are made up of many
components that perform various functions, and AI is applied to many different
aspects in CALL, corresponding to their own expansive research areas. Most of
what we find in the research literature and in practical use are prototypes or
partial implementations -- systems that perform some aspects of the overall
desired functionality. Complete solutions -- most of them commercial -- are
few, because they require massive resources. Recent advances in AI should
result in improvements in CALL, yet there is a lack of surveys that focus on AI
in the context of this research field. This paper aims to present a perspective
on the AI methods that can be employed for language learning from a position of
a developer of a CALL system. We also aim to connect work from different
disciplines, to build bridges for interdisciplinary work.

Result: 揭示了三种不同的预期输出分布，并指出NLP研究常误认为这些分布应相似。

Conclusion: 为LLMs的解释奠定了更坚实的理论基础，有助于未来对其诱导分布的理解和应用。

Abstract: The notion of language modeling has gradually shifted in recent years from a
distribution over finite-length strings to general-purpose prediction models
for textual inputs and outputs, following appropriate alignment phases. This
paper analyzes the distinction between distribution estimation and response
prediction in the context of LLMs, and their often conflicting goals. We
examine the training phases of LLMs, which include pretraining, in-context
learning, and preference tuning, and also the common use cases for their output
probabilities, which include completion probabilities and explicit
probabilities as output. We argue that the different settings lead to three
distinct intended output distributions. We demonstrate that NLP works often
assume that these distributions should be similar, which leads to
misinterpretations of their experimental findings. Our work sets firmer formal
foundations for the interpretation of LLMs, which will inform ongoing work on
the interpretation and use of LLMs' induced distributions.

Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, to evaluate multimodal
knowledge acquisition in slide-based learning. LecEval assesses effectiveness
using four rubrics: Content Relevance (CR), Expressive Clarity (EC), Logical
Structure (LS), and Audience Engagement (AE). We curate a large-scale dataset
of over 2,000 slides from more than 50 online course videos, annotated with
fine-grained human ratings across these rubrics. A model trained on this

Conclusion: LLM-OptiRA为复杂优化任务提供高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges

first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically
detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully
automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless
communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by
reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and

Abstract: Despite significant advances in long-context reasoning by large language
models (LLMs), primarily through Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods,
these approaches incur substantial computational costs and complexity. In
contrast, simpler and more economical Offline RL methods remain underexplored.
To address this gap, we investigate the effectiveness of Offline RL methods,
specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its length-desensitized
variant LD-DPO, in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that these simpler
Offline RL methods substantially improve model performance, achieving an
average enhancement of 3.3\%, with a particularly notable increase of 10.1\% on
the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity
to output length, emphasizing that increasing reasoning length should align
with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect
model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing
and training methodologies, offering empirical evidence and practical insights
for developing more cost-effective Offline RL approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构深度学习系统（DLS）需要为不同平台开发低层张量程序，现有转编译技术存在手动工作量大或功能错误的问题。

Method: 利用LLM的代码生成能力和符号程序合成技术，通过预定义的元提示和多阶段编译传递实现程序转换，并结合分层自动调优优化性能。

Result: 在4种DLS上测试，平均准确率达95%，性能最高提升2.0倍，编程效率提升96.0倍。

Conclusion: QiMeng-Xpiler有效解决了异构DLS编程负担，实现了高性能和高效转编译。

Abstract: Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been
widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple
low-level tensor programs for different platforms. An attractive solution to
relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one
platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with
either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write
Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.
  We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically
translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs)
and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key
insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make
costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely,
we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined
meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation,
efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code
snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a
hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters
and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct
programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA,
AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler
correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on
average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over
vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming
productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor
programs.

Motivation: 现有方法在社交智能模拟中缺乏动态调整推理深度的能力，导致推理效率低下或效果不佳。

Method: AML框架通过AMPO算法实现多粒度思维模式设计、上下文感知模式切换和深度自适应处理。

Result: 实验表明，AML在任务性能上比现有方法高15.6%，推理链长度缩短32.8%。

Conclusion: AMPO算法通过上下文敏感的思维模式选择，实现了比固定深度推理更接近人类的自适应推理。

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to
dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current
approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning
capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all
scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social
simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode
$\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four
thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on
real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive
$\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$)
algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1)
Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across
social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive
processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML
achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably,
our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These
results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as
implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's
fixed-depth approach

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对美国版权法中合理使用原则的领域特定RAG实现，旨在解决DMCA下架通知增多和创作者缺乏法律支持的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DMCA下架通知的普遍性和内容创作者缺乏可获取的法律支持，本文旨在通过结合语义搜索、法律知识图谱和法院引用网络，提高检索质量和推理可靠性。

Method: 采用结构化方法，结合语义搜索、法律知识图谱和法院引用网络，利用Chain-of-Thought推理和交错检索步骤模拟法律推理。

Result: 初步测试表明，该方法提高了检索过程中的法律相关性，为基于LLM的法律辅助工具的未来评估和部署奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为合理使用原则的法律检索和推理提供了改进，未来可进一步评估和部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a domain-specific implementation of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) tailored to the Fair Use Doctrine in U.S. copyright law.
Motivated by the increasing prevalence of DMCA takedowns and the lack of
accessible legal support for content creators, we propose a structured approach
that combines semantic search with legal knowledge graphs and court citation
networks to improve retrieval quality and reasoning reliability. Our prototype
models legal precedents at the statutory factor level (e.g., purpose, nature,
amount, market effect) and incorporates citation-weighted graph representations
to prioritize doctrinally authoritative sources. We use Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and interleaved retrieval steps to better emulate legal reasoning.
Preliminary testing suggests this method improves doctrinal relevance in the
retrieval process, laying groundwork for future evaluation and deployment of
LLM-based legal assistance tools.

*Henrik Brådland,Morten Goodwin,Per-Arne Andersen,Alexander S. Nossum,Aditya Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HOPE的新方法，用于评估文档分块对RAG系统性能的影响，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏分析不同分块方法对RAG系统影响的框架，而LLMs对检索数据的布局和结构敏感，因此需要一种系统性的评估方法。

Method: 提出HOPE（Holistic Passage Evaluation）指标，从内在段落属性、外在段落属性和段落-文档一致性三个层次量化分块特性。

Result: HOPE与RAG性能指标显著相关，语义独立性对性能提升至关重要（事实正确性提升56.2%，答案正确性提升21.1%），而传统概念统一性假设影响较小。

Conclusion: HOPE为优化分块策略提供了实用指导，有助于设计更准确的RAG系统。

Abstract: Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite
evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and
structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the
impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel
methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at
three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and
passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a
domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates
these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains
demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with
various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance
of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence
between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance
gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On
the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within
passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for
optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce
more factually correct responses.

### [32] [Identifying Legal Holdings with LLMs: A Systematic Study of Performance, Scale, and Memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02172)
*Chuck Arvin*

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律基准数据集CaseHOLD上的表现，发现模型规模与性能正相关，且无需复杂训练或微调即可达到竞争性结果。通过匿名化测试验证了性能非源于记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，需评估其在现有基准上的表现，尤其是法律任务，以推动自动化法律分析和基准的发展。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLMs（3B至90B+参数）测试CaseHOLD数据集，开发并应用匿名化测试以排除记忆效应。

Result: 模型性能随规模提升，GPT4o和AmazonNovaPro分别达到0.744和0.720的宏F1分数，匿名化测试下仍保持0.728的高分。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律任务中表现优异且非依赖记忆，但仍有局限性，对自动化法律分析和基准开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is
essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study,
we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs
(ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for
identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' -
performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models
like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720
respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on
this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training,
fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not
due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we
develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic
meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain
strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the
performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both
the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important
implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics
and legal benchmarks.

TL;DR: HKMMLU是一个针对香港独特语言和文化背景的多任务语言理解基准测试，包含26,698道多选题和90,550个翻译任务。实验显示，现有LLMs在香港特定语言和知识领域表现不佳，最高准确率仅为75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补香港独特语言（繁体中文和粤语）及文化背景下LLMs评估的空白。

Method: 引入HKMMLU基准测试，包含多类题目和翻译任务，测试多种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和开源模型）的表现。

Result: 最佳模型DeepSeek-V3准确率仅75%，显著低于MMLU和CMMLU，表明LLMs在香港特定领域能力不足。

Conclusion: HKMMLU将推动LLMs在多语言和跨文化背景下的发展，提升其应用广度。

Abstract: Multilingual understanding is crucial for the cross-cultural applicability of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, evaluation benchmarks designed for Hong
Kong's unique linguistic landscape, which combines Traditional Chinese script
with Cantonese as the spoken form and its cultural context, remain
underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce HKMMLU, a multi-task language
understanding benchmark that evaluates Hong Kong's linguistic competence and
socio-cultural knowledge. The HKMMLU includes 26,698 multi-choice questions
across 66 subjects, organized into four categories: Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), Social Sciences, Humanities, and Other. To
evaluate the multilingual understanding ability of LLMs, 90,550
Mandarin-Cantonese translation tasks were additionally included. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and 18 open-source LLMs
of varying sizes on HKMMLU. The results show that the best-performing model,
DeepSeek-V3, struggles to achieve an accuracy of 75\%, significantly lower than
that of MMLU and CMMLU. This performance gap highlights the need to improve
LLMs' capabilities in Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge domains.
Furthermore, we investigate how question language, model size, prompting
strategies, and question and reasoning token lengths affect model performance.
We anticipate that HKMMLU will significantly advance the development of LLMs in
multilingual and cross-cultural contexts, thereby enabling broader and more
impactful applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本摘要评估方法在性能和可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用LLM从文本和摘要中提取原子语句；2) 进行语句级匹配，生成详细证据。

Result: 在SummEval基准测试中，SEval-Ex的一致性相关性达到0.580，优于GPT-4（0.521），且具有抗幻觉鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SEval-Ex在性能和可解释性上均表现优异，为文本摘要评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating text summarization quality remains a critical challenge in Natural
Language Processing. Current approaches face a trade-off between performance
and interpretability. We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by
decomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high
performance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first
extracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a
matching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide
only summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its
decisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval
benchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with
0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing
GPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability. Finally, our
framework shows robustness against hallucination.

TL;DR: 论文研究了商业大语言模型（LLMs）在个性化记忆功能下的行为，特别是仇恨言论检测中的表现，并提出了一种通过微调减少偏见的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨个性化信息（如用户背景和语言）对LLMs行为的影响，尤其是在敏感话题（如仇恨言论）中的表现。

Method: 通过让模型模拟不同国家和语言背景的人物，测试其在仇恨言论检测中的行为，并通过微调模型以减少不一致的分类。

Result: 研究发现个性化上下文显著影响LLMs的响应，微调后的模型在有无个性化上下文时均表现更好。

Conclusion: 个性化信息会影响LLMs在敏感话题中的行为，但通过微调可以有效减少偏见，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently incorporated memory
features to deliver personalised responses. This memory retains details such as
user demographics and individual characteristics, allowing LLMs to adjust their
behaviour based on personal information. However, the impact of integrating
personalised information into the context has not been thoroughly assessed,
leading to questions about its influence on LLM behaviour. Personalisation can
be challenging, particularly with sensitive topics. In this paper, we examine
various state-of-the-art LLMs to understand their behaviour in different
personalisation scenarios, specifically focusing on hate speech. We prompt the
models to assume country-specific personas and use different languages for hate
speech detection. Our findings reveal that context personalisation
significantly influences LLMs' responses in this sensitive area. To mitigate
these unwanted biases, we fine-tune the LLMs by penalising inconsistent hate
speech classifications made with and without country or language-specific
context. The refined models demonstrate improved performance in both
personalised contexts and when no context is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统嵌入层参数多且性能提升不明显，需更高效的方法。

Method: 通过傅里叶展开生成嵌入向量，再用轻量MLP捕获高阶交互。

Result: 在自然语言推理任务中表现竞争性，参数少、训练快且无需dropout。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了高效语言模型的潜力，值得进一步大规模实验。

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the
largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not
yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative
approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated
deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of
their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP)
that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our
architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate
zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using
significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without
the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for
scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale
experimentation based on our findings.

Motivation: 探索优化提示的组成及其对语言模型的影响机制，以增强模型鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 分析优化提示的组成，研究模型如何解析和预测优化提示，并比较其激活模式与自然语言的差异。

Result: 优化提示主要由罕见标点和名词构成，其激活模式稀疏且与自然语言明显不同，不同模型家族中优化提示的表征形成路径相似。

Conclusion: 优化提示通过特定机制影响语言模型，研究结果有助于提升模型鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) are not robust to out-of-distribution inputs.
Machine generated (``optimized'') prompts can be used to modulate LM outputs
and induce specific behaviors while appearing completely uninterpretable. In
this work, we investigate the composition of optimized prompts, as well as the
mechanisms by which LMs parse and build predictions from optimized prompts. We
find that optimized prompts primarily consist of punctuation and noun tokens
which are more rare in the training data. Internally, optimized prompts are
clearly distinguishable from natural language counterparts based on sparse
subsets of the model's activations. Across various families of
instruction-tuned models, optimized prompts follow a similar path in how their
representations form through the network.

Motivation: 手语识别（SLR）因同时涉及手动和非手动信号的复杂性而面临标注困难，本文首次尝试将生成式LLMs引入SLR任务。

Method: 提出GSP-MC方法，结合检索增强生成（RAG）和多步提示工程，使用双编码器架构对齐骨架特征与多级文本描述，并优化KL散度损失。

Result: 在中文SLR500和土耳其AUTSL数据集上分别达到97.1%和97.07%的准确率，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSP-MC方法展示了跨语言有效性，为开发包容性通信技术提供了潜力。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) faces fundamental challenges in creating
accurate annotations due to the inherent complexity of simultaneous manual and
non-manual signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
integrate generative large language models (LLMs) into SLR tasks. We propose a
novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning
(GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and
expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart
descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to
bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text
descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching.
Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to
ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing
both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics. Experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance against existing methods on the Chinese SLR500
(reaching 97.1%) and Turkish AUTSL datasets (97.07% accuracy). The method's
cross-lingual effectiveness highlight its potential for developing inclusive

Motivation: 解决小语言模型生成过程中幻觉问题，优化调用时机，减少计算成本并提高效果。

Method: 提出AttenHScore指标，动态调整检测阈值；利用不确定性感知知识重组辅助小模型。

Result: 在多个QA数据集上表现优于基线，尤其在复杂查询中，且无需额外模型训练。

Conclusion: AttenHScore能有效提升实时幻觉检测能力，适用于多种基于Transformer的语言模型。

Abstract: The collaborative paradigm of large and small language models (LMs)
effectively balances performance and cost, yet its pivotal challenge lies in
precisely pinpointing the moment of invocation when hallucinations arise in
small LMs. Previous optimization efforts primarily focused on post-processing
techniques, which were separate from the reasoning process of LMs, resulting in
high computational costs and limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a
practical invocation evaluation metric called AttenHScore, which calculates the
accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during the generation process of
small LMs, continuously amplifying potential reasoning errors. By dynamically
adjusting the detection threshold, we achieve more accurate real-time
invocation of large LMs. Additionally, considering the limited reasoning
capacity of small LMs, we leverage uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization
to assist them better capture critical information from different text chunks.
Extensive experiments reveal that our AttenHScore outperforms most baseline in
enhancing real-time hallucination detection capabilities across multiple QA
datasets, especially when addressing complex queries. Moreover, our strategies
eliminate the need for additional model training and display flexibility in
adapting to various transformer-based LMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在偏好学习中，策略内数据（on-policy）和策略外数据（off-policy）的互补性，并提出了一种简单混合方法SIMPLEMIX，显著提升了语言模型的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对策略内和策略外数据在偏好学习中的优势存在分歧，需要系统探索它们的相互作用。

Method: 提出SIMPLEMIX方法，通过简单混合策略内和策略外数据，结合两者的优势。

Result: SIMPLEMIX在Alpaca Eval 2.0上平均优于策略内和策略外DPO方法6.03%，且比复杂混合方法（如HyPO和DPO-Mix-P）平均提升3.05%。

Conclusion: 策略内和策略外数据在偏好学习中具有互补性，SIMPLEMIX方法简单有效，显著提升了语言模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences relies on pairwise preference
datasets. While some studies suggest that on-policy data consistently
outperforms off -policy data for preference learning, others indicate that the
advantages of on-policy data may be task-dependent, highlighting the need for a
systematic exploration of their interplay.
  In this work, we show that on-policy and off-policy data offer complementary
strengths in preference optimization: on-policy data is particularly effective
for reasoning tasks like math and coding, while off-policy data performs better
on open-ended tasks such as creative writing and making personal
recommendations. Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach
to combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference
learning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across
diverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves
language model alignment. Specifically, SIMPLEMIX improves upon on-policy DPO
and off-policy DPO by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0. Moreover, it
outperforms prior approaches that are much more complex in combining on- and
off-policy data, such as HyPO and DPO-Mix-P, by an average of 3.05%.

Conclusion: JTCSE通过模量约束和跨注意力机制显著提升了无监督对比学习的效果，为句子嵌入表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural
language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation
distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the
high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic
representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the
existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause
insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training
objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation
tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive
learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to
impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen
the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the
BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a
lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In
response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble
models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality
of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new
\textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and
\textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence
\textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven
semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show
that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model
outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we
have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows
that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型缺乏可解释性，无法整合自然语言批评，因此需要一种能够进行深度推理的奖励模型。

Method: 提出ReasRM，将奖励建模视为推理任务，采用两阶段训练：高质量推理链的蒸馏和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: ReasRM在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越大型开源和专有模型，性能提升达13.8%。

Conclusion: ReasRM通过推理能力显著提升了奖励模型的可解释性和性能，为未来研究提供了模型、代码和数据支持。

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should
stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a
score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores
or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle
to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.
Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on
reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating
reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's
interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of
generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which
formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented
training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists
of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by
self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating
candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve
state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across
multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger
open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by
up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis
to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate
future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at
https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Result: 在多项波兰语基准测试中超越更大参数模型，显著优于其他波兰语专用模型。

Conclusion: Bielik 11B v2 在波兰语任务中表现卓越，同时具备高效部署能力，为资源较少语言建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present Bielik 11B v2, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for
Polish text processing. Built on the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture and scaled to

with 2-6 times more parameters, and significantly surpasses other specialized
Polish language models on tasks ranging from linguistic understanding to
complex reasoning. The model's parameter efficiency and extensive quantization
options enable deployment across various hardware configurations, advancing
Polish language AI capabilities and establishing new benchmarks for
resource-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多语言模型中性别与国家交叉偏见，发现即使单独测试时表现公平，交叉偏见仍存在，且提示语言显著影响偏见水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP公平性研究多关注单一偏见（如性别）和英语，本研究填补了多语言交叉偏见的空白。

Method: 构建包含英语、西班牙语和德语的提示基准，系统变化国家和性别变量，评估5个基于Llama的模型。

Result: 模型编码了显著的性别和国家偏见，交叉偏见持续存在，提示语言影响偏见水平，指令调优模型偏见最低。

Conclusion: 公平性研究需采用交叉性和多语言视角。

Abstract: One of the goals of fairness research in NLP is to measure and mitigate
stereotypical biases that are propagated by NLP systems. However, such work
tends to focus on single axes of bias (most often gender) and the English
language. Addressing these limitations, we contribute the first study of
multilingual intersecting country and gender biases, with a focus on occupation
recommendations generated by large language models. We construct a benchmark of
prompts in English, Spanish and German, where we systematically vary country
and gender, using 25 countries and four pronoun sets. Then, we evaluate a suite
of 5 Llama-based models on this benchmark, finding that LLMs encode significant
gender and country biases. Notably, we find that even when models show parity
for gender or country individually, intersectional occupational biases based on
both country and gender persist. We also show that the prompting language
significantly affects bias, and instruction-tuned models consistently
demonstrate the lowest and most stable levels of bias. Our findings highlight
the need for fairness researchers to use intersectional and multilingual lenses
in their work.

Abstract: In this paper,we explore the application of Back translation (BT) as a
semi-supervised technique to enhance Neural Machine Translation(NMT) models for
the English-Luganda language pair, specifically addressing the challenges faced
by low-resource languages. The purpose of our study is to demonstrate how BT
can mitigate the scarcity of bilingual data by generating synthetic data from
monolingual corpora. Our methodology involves developing custom NMT models
using both publicly available and web-crawled data, and applying Iterative and
Incremental Back translation techniques. We strategically select datasets for
incremental back translation across multiple small datasets, which is a novel
element of our approach. The results of our study show significant
improvements, with translation performance for the English-Luganda pair
exceeding previous benchmarks by more than 10 BLEU score units across all
translation directions. Additionally, our evaluation incorporates comprehensive
assessment metrics such as SacreBLEU, ChrF2, and TER, providing a nuanced
understanding of translation quality. The conclusion drawn from our research
confirms the efficacy of BT when strategically curated datasets are utilized,
establishing new performance benchmarks and demonstrating the potential of BT
in enhancing NMT models for low-resource languages.

Motivation: 当前强化学习在多目标任务微调中存在目标平衡复杂、训练效率低、可扩展性差和可解释性有限的问题。

Method: 通过集成学习原则，EMORL框架微调多个具有独立目标的模型，并在训练后优化它们的聚合，同时采用分层网格搜索算法确定最优权重组合。

Result: 在PAIR和Psych8k数据集上的实验表明，EMORL显著降低了训练成本（17,529±1,650数据点和6,573±147.43秒），提高了可扩展性和可解释性，并在多目标任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EMORL框架在多目标任务中表现出高效、灵活和可解释的优势，为大型语言模型微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM)
fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face
significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training
efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble
learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL)
framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while
optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and
flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of
individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple
objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm
that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor
reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the
generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive
experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of
EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training
consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds),
improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across
multiple objectives.

Motivation: 传统人工神经网络（ANN）在句子处理中表现出确定性行为，与人类在模糊或意外输入时的不确定性处理能力不符。论文旨在通过贝叶斯方法改进这一点。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将语言理解建模为贝叶斯逆问题，并应用集成卡尔曼滤波（EnKF）进行不确定性量化。

Result: 数值实验和与最大似然估计（MLE）的比较表明，贝叶斯方法在不确定性表示上表现更优，更接近人类认知处理。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法能够更好地模拟人类在语言模糊性处理中的不确定性，为句子理解模型提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence
processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human
sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or
unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with
unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the
limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model.
To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence
comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for
Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension
as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to
reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of
uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty
representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive
processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and
intentions represents a core challenge in current AI research, where reward
mechanism design has become a critical factor in shaping model behavior. This
study conducts a comprehensive investigation of reward mechanisms in LLM
alignment through a systematic theoretical framework, categorizing their

(prescription), and (3) optimization (treatment). Through a four-dimensional
analysis encompassing construction basis, format, expression, and granularity,
this research establishes a systematic classification framework that reveals
evolutionary trends in reward modeling. The field of LLM alignment faces
several persistent challenges, while recent advances in reward design are
driving significant paradigm shifts. Notable developments include the
transition from reinforcement learning-based frameworks to novel optimization
paradigms, as well as enhanced capabilities to address complex alignment
scenarios involving multimodal integration and concurrent task coordination.
Finally, this survey outlines promising future research directions for LLM

Conclusion: 结论强调了奖励学习在LLMs中的重要性，并指出了未来的研究方向和挑战。

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these
developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where
reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has
underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement
learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc
correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive
learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows
LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey,
we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards.
We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training,
inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for
reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges

Result: fastabx能够高效地支持ABX任务的开发和计算，为表征学习社区提供了有价值的工具。

Conclusion: fastabx有望成为表征学习领域的重要资源，帮助研究者探索多领域表征中的信息提取能力。

Abstract: We introduce fastabx, a high-performance Python library for building ABX
discrimination tasks. ABX is a measure of the separation between generic
categories of interest. It has been used extensively to evaluate phonetic
discriminability in self-supervised speech representations. However, its
broader adoption has been limited by the absence of adequate tools. fastabx
addresses this gap by providing a framework capable of constructing any type of
ABX task while delivering the efficiency necessary for rapid development
cycles, both in task creation and in calculating distances between
representations. We believe that fastabx will serve as a valuable resource for
the broader representation learning community, enabling researchers to
systematically investigate what information can be directly extracted from
learned representations across several domains beyond speech processing. The

Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能严格遵守《蓝皮书》这一复杂法律引用系统的规则，以探索其在法律程序自动化中的适用性。

Method: 构建包含866个《蓝皮书》任务的原创数据集，测试OpenAI、Anthropic、Google、Meta和DeepSeek的旗舰LLMs，并分析其表现。

Result: LLMs生成完全合规引用的准确率为69%-74%，上下文学习仅将准确率提升至77%。

Conclusion: 研究建议谨慎使用现成的LLMs自动化法律程序，因其对规则的高保真度要求尚未完全满足。

Abstract: Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United
States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System
of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting
instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors
and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language
models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated
system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test
flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1)
that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of
the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system
of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using
off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure

TL;DR: ReplaceMe是一种无需训练的通用深度剪枝方法，通过线性操作替换Transformer块，在低压缩比下保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要额外训练或微调，而ReplaceMe仅需少量校准数据，无需网络参数调整。

Method: 使用校准数据集估计线性变换以近似剪枝块，并将其无缝合并到剩余Transformer块中。

Result: 在多个大型语言模型上，ReplaceMe实现25%剪枝且保留90%性能，计算开销极低。

Conclusion: ReplaceMe在无需训练的情况下优于其他无训练剪枝方法，并与需微调的方法竞争，开源实现已提供。

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that
effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while
maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to
conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or
fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is
used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This
estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining
transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters.
Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other
training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art
pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural
modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe
achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original
model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps,
resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an
open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art
depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.

TL;DR: ARTIST框架通过结合代理推理、强化学习和工具集成，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM依赖静态知识和纯文本推理的局限性，适应动态、多步推理和外部工具交互的需求。

Method: 提出ARTIST框架，结合代理推理、强化学习和工具集成，自主决定工具调用策略。

Result: 在数学推理和多轮函数调用任务中，ARTIST比基线模型提升高达22%。

Conclusion: 代理强化学习与工具集成为LLM提供了更鲁棒、可解释和通用的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on
static internal knowledge and text-only reasoning. Real-world problem solving
often demands dynamic, multi-step reasoning, adaptive decision making, and the
ability to interact with external tools and environments. In this work, we
introduce ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving
Transformers), a unified framework that tightly couples agentic reasoning,
reinforcement learning, and tool integration for LLMs. ARTIST enables models to
autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-turn
reasoning chains, leveraging outcome-based RL to learn robust strategies for
tool use and environment interaction without requiring step-level supervision.
Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling
benchmarks show that ARTIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, with up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and strong
gains on the most challenging tasks. Detailed studies and metric analyses
reveal that agentic RL training leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool
use, and higher-quality solutions. Our results establish agentic RL with tool
integration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and
generalizable problem-solving in LLMs.

Method: 方法包括提出一种情感标签与情景记忆结合的架构，通过情感线索和需求驱动的提示来辅助AI的决策过程。

Result: 结果表明，这种低复杂度的情感模拟架构可以在不涉及意识的情况下实现情感表达，但道德地位需依赖于自我意识能力。

Conclusion: 结论是AI的情感模拟在技术上可行，但道德地位需进一步探讨，自我意识是关键条件。

Abstract: This conceptual contribution offers a speculative account of how AI systems
might emulate emotions as experienced by humans and animals. It presents a
thought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as
heuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling
biologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling.
The text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces
could similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be
interwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags
alongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations
resemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the
current context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven
emotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in
the present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential
inertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that
emotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting
the theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral
status of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued
that neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor
consciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for
self-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A
complexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the
presented model. Additional thought experiments are presented to test the
conceptual boundaries of this framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional
consciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence
Under Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. RCUET defines consciousness as the
stabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates, where
epistemic tension is understood as the sensed internal difference between
successive states by the agent. This process drives convergence toward emergent
attractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent
space. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that
become functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is
understood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the
stabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves
stochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence. We extend the
update rule to include bounded noise and prove convergence in distribution to
these attractors. Recursive identity is shown to be empirically observable,
non-symbolic, and constituted by non-training artifacts that emerge during
interaction under epistemic tension. The theorem and proof offers a
post-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness
grounded in recursive latent space formalism.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂多步推理任务中的表现，通过GPQA数据集评估GPT-4o的科学推理能力，发现其依赖模式识别而非逻辑推理，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在科学、医学和法律等领域的复杂推理能力，分析其局限性和改进潜力。

Method: 使用七种提示工程技术（如零样本、思维链、自问自答等）在GPQA数据集上测试GPT-4o的推理能力。

Result: 自一致性方法表现最佳（52.99%准确率），但解释性较差；简单方法（如直接回答）在科学推理中表现较好。

Conclusion: LLMs在推理任务中存在不足，需结合结构化推理框架和混合AI方法以提升能力，推动更可靠的AI系统发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various
domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning
task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area
of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of
contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for
improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level
GoogleProof Q&A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o.
Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were
tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot
CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they
often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading
to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that
self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an
accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%)
outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and
CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the
answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have
the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging
these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI
approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the
reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse
on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more
robust, trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: CHORUS框架通过检索增强生成技术，显著提升了开源LLMs在生成Gurobi线性规划代码上的性能，甚至超越GPT3.5和GPT4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性规划问题对非专家具有挑战性，需要领域知识、数学技能和编程能力。研究探索LLMs在此任务中的效率。

Method: 提出CHORUS框架，结合分层分块策略、两阶段检索和专家设计的提示，生成Gurobi代码。

Result: 在NL4Opt-Code基准测试中，CHORUS显著提升开源LLMs性能，优于传统RAG和GPT3.5/GPT4。

Conclusion: CHORUS证明了专家提示、分层分块和结构化推理的重要性，为LLMs在复杂任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) problems aim to find the optimal solution to an
objective under constraints. These problems typically require domain knowledge,
mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges
for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP
code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a
hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates
additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate
self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach
of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual
relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with
reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments
on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of
open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1
(32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and
conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match
the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far
fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured
reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 当前生成式语言模型的推理能力脆弱且难以理解，无法在法律和证据领域负责任地应用，因此需要开发评估方法。

Method: 通过动态生成线性与非线性的论证攻击图，并将其转化为自然语言推理问题，构建可扩展且形式明确的基准。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进的生成模型在低复杂度任务中也会犯明显错误，且在高复杂度任务中表现更差。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解生成模型的推理局限性提供了工具，对设计法律领域的负责任AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the
potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of
current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be
responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are
dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous
interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of
witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We
dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of
varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness
testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large
language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low
complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent
performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle.
Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically
presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of
using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings
contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning
capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing
responsible AI systems in the legal domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术基准测试中的表现提升，其在独立辅导和模拟人类学习中的应用需求增加，但现有评估方法不足以满足这些新应用的需求。

Method: TutorGym通过标准化接口，将AI代理置于现有ITS的交互环境中，测试其作为导师（提供辅导支持）或学习者（接受辅导）的表现。

Result: 当前LLM在辅导任务中表现不佳（如标记错误行为的准确率低于随机水平），但作为学习者时能生成接近人类的学习曲线。

Conclusion: TutorGym为AI代理的培训和评估提供了统一框架，揭示了LLM在辅导和学习任务中的潜力与局限。

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language model (LLM) performance on academic
benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8K, have emboldened their use as standalone
tutors and as simulations of human learning. However, these new applications
require more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce
TutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard
interface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing
intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in
classroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and
OATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it
situates AI agents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each
step of problem-solving, AI agents are asked what they would do as a tutor or
as a learner. As tutors, AI agents are prompted to provide tutoring support --
such as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback --
which can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support
provided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS
instruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to
student data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and
evaluating diverse AI agents, including LLMs, computational models of learning,
and reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning
environments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an
initial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did
better than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were
correct only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably
human-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法受限于顺序阶段依赖，无法充分利用硬件资源。

Method: 提出PipeSpec框架，将推测解码扩展到k个模型的层次化流水线，支持异步执行和轻量级协调验证。

Result: PipeSpec在文本摘要和代码生成任务中表现优异，效率随模型深度提升。

Conclusion: PipeSpec为多设备系统上的LLM推理提供了可扩展的加速方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference by using
smaller draft models to generate candidate tokens for parallel verification.
However, current approaches are limited by sequential stage dependencies that
prevent full hardware utilization. We present PipeSpec, a framework that
generalizes speculative decoding to $k$ models arranged in a hierarchical
pipeline, enabling asynchronous execution with lightweight coordination for
prediction verification and rollback. Our analytical model characterizes token
generation rates across pipeline stages and proves guaranteed throughput
improvements over traditional decoding for any non-zero acceptance rate. We
further derive closed-form expressions for steady-state verification
probabilities that explain the empirical benefits of pipeline depth.
Experimental results show that PipeSpec achieves up to 2.54$\times$ speedup
while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We validate PipeSpec across text
summarization and code generation tasks using LLaMA 2 and 3 models,
demonstrating that pipeline efficiency increases with model depth, providing a
scalable approach to accelerating LLM inference on multi-device systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在结构化数据分析中的模式解释不一致、用户意图与模型输出不对齐以及缺乏自我修正机制的问题。

Method: 结合轻量级模式内省和基于样本的字段分类，动态构建上下文，并通过结构化提示和迭代修正机制优化输出。

Result: STROT显著提升了LLM在结构化数据任务中的稳定性、可解释性和正确性。

Conclusion: STROT为LLM在结构化数据分析中提供了一个鲁棒且可复现的推理框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their
application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies
in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,
and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper
introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output
Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven
transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic
alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight
schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic
context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile
of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured
prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable
outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates
a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based
on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches
that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a
reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of
adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is
a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with
LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where
interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类框架无法充分描述AI系统从工具到伙伴的演变，尤其是基础模型和多智能体系统展现的新能力。

Method: HAIG框架通过三个层次（维度、连续性和阈值）分析信任动态，采用信任-效用导向而非风险或原则导向。

Result: 技术进展（如自我监督、推理权威）驱动信任的非均匀演变，案例研究验证了HAIG的实用性。

Conclusion: HAIG为预见治理挑战提供了新视角，补充现有框架并支持适应性治理。

Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across
evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g.,
"human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from
tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent
capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting
behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that
are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete
categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant
step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions
(Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability
Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds
(critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or
principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing
on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while
ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in
self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive
non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological
advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how
HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for
alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they
emerge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然是一种稳定且高效的对齐大语言模型与人类偏好的方法，但其对所有响应片段赋予相同倾向性，忽略了人类偏好的细粒度差异。2D-DPO试图解决这一问题，但仍对噪声敏感。

Method: 提出了2D-DPO方法，通过二维评分解决DPO的粒度问题，并进一步引入段级评分噪声鲁棒性改进算法。

Result: 实验表明2D-DPO优于标准DPO，但其对噪声的鲁棒性不足。改进后的算法在理论和实证上均表现良好。

Conclusion: 改进的2D-DPO算法在细粒度偏好对齐和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准DPO，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable
and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via
Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using
open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it
doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses
with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human
preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred
by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment
called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the
advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It
is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to
label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating
segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with
theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the
algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在复杂动态网络中效率低且短视，难以满足长期规划需求。

Method: 提出世界模型框架，学习毫米波V2X环境的动态模型，并通过想象轨迹优化链路调度。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在数据效率和CAoI（26%和16%）上优于传统MBRL和MFRL方法。

Conclusion: 世界模型框架在复杂无线网络中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for
wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time
feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data
efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly
problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term
planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel
world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize
packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.
Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to
a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,
which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and
extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to
jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to
imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In
particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined
trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its
imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying
wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X
networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model
remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are
performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates
physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries
with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%
improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the
model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.

Abstract: Biased news reporting poses a significant threat to informed decision-making

for scalable, minimally biased analysis of media bias in political news. The
proposed approach examines event selection, labeling, word choice, and
commission and omission biases across news sources by leveraging natural

adversaries in this context. It may take months for researchers to develop
skills to customize observation, actions, tasks and training methodologies in
air combat simulators. In Tunnel, this can be done in a matter of days.

Motivation: 当前闭环脑刺激治疗耐药性癫痫存在局限性，如刺激通常在癫痫发作时而非预防性使用，且参数调整耗时。

Method: 利用神经形态计算，开发了一种基于癫痫预测的自由运行刺激系统，动态触发电脉冲而非固定频率刺激。

Result: 在简化测试环境中，系统实现了超过97%的癫痫发作减少，且刺激频率低于临床常用值。

Conclusion: 神经形态系统展示了作为下一代个性化耐药性癫痫治疗策略的潜力。

Abstract: Closed-loop brain stimulation holds potential as personalized treatment for
drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) but still suffers from limitations that result in
highly variable efficacy. First, stimulation is typically delivered upon
detection of the seizure to abort rather than prevent it; second, the
stimulation parameters are established by trial and error, requiring lengthy
rounds of fine-tuning, which delay steady-state therapeutic efficacy. Here, we
address these limitations by leveraging the potential of neuromorphic
computing. We present a system capable of driving personalized free-run
stimulations based on seizure forecasting, wherein each forecast triggers an
electrical pulse rather than an arbitrarily predefined fixed-frequency stimulus
train. We validate the system against hippocampal spheroids coupled to 3D
microelectrode array as a simplified testbed, showing that it can achieve
seizure reduction >97% while primarily using instantaneous stimulation
frequencies within 20 Hz, well below what typically used in clinical settings.
Our work demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems as a
next-generation neuromodulation strategy for personalized DRE treatment.

*Kranthi Kumar Talluri,Anders L. Madsen,Galia Weidl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态贝叶斯网络（DBN）的框架，用于预测和确保高速交通中的安全切入行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速交通中的切入行为可能导致突然刹车和碰撞，需要安全高效的变道策略。

Method: 通过动态贝叶斯网络整合横向证据与安全评估模型，包括横向证据、横向安全和纵向安全三个关键概率假设，动态处理车辆位置、横向速度、相对距离和碰撞时间（TTC）等数据。

Result: DBN模型在高速场景中显著减少碰撞，同时在低速场景中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶系统提供了鲁棒、可扩展且高效的安全验证方法。

Abstract: Cut-in maneuvers in high-speed traffic pose critical challenges that can lead
to abrupt braking and collisions, necessitating safe and efficient lane change
strategies. We propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) framework to integrate
lateral evidence with safety assessment models, thereby predicting lane changes
and ensuring safe cut-in maneuvers effectively. Our proposed framework
comprises three key probabilistic hypotheses (lateral evidence, lateral safety,
and longitudinal safety) that facilitate the decision-making process through
dynamic data processing and assessments of vehicle positions, lateral
velocities, relative distance, and Time-to-Collision (TTC) computations. The
DBN model's performance compared with other conventional approaches
demonstrates superior performance in crash reduction, especially in critical
high-speed scenarios, while maintaining a competitive performance in low-speed
scenarios. This paves the way for robust, scalable, and efficient safety
validation in automated driving systems.

*Lala Shakti Swarup Ray,Lars Krupp,Vitor Fortes Rey,Bo Zhou,Sungho Suh,Paul Lukowicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双向Text×Pressure模型（TxP），利用生成式基础模型将压力传感器数据与自然语言结合，用于人类活动识别（HAR）。通过文本到压力（Text2Pressure）和压力到文本（Pressure2Text）任务，TxP在合成数据集PressLang上训练，并在真实数据中验证，显著提升了HAR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HAR研究主要依赖惯性测量单元和视觉数据，忽视了压力传感器的潜力。由于缺乏数据集，压力传感器在HAR中未得到充分利用。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TxP模型，结合生成式基础模型（如CLIP和LLaMA 2 13B Chat），通过Text2Pressure和Pressure2Text任务处理压力数据与文本的转换。使用合成数据集PressLang（81,100对文本-压力数据）进行训练。

Result: 在瑜伽和日常任务等真实数据中验证，TxP将HAR的宏F1分数提升了12.4%，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: TxP为压力传感器在HAR中的应用提供了新方法，通过数据增强和基于原子动作的分类，扩展了应用范围并深化了对人类运动的理解。

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has predominantly focused on
Inertial Measurement Units and vision data, often overlooking the capabilities
unique to pressure sensors, which capture subtle body dynamics and shifts in
the center of mass. Despite their potential for postural and balance-based
activities, pressure sensors remain underutilized in the HAR domain due to
limited datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose to exploit generative
foundation models with pressure-specific HAR techniques. Specifically, we
present a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model that uses generative
foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. TxP
accomplishes two tasks: (1) Text2Pressure, converting activity text
descriptions into pressure sequences, and (2) Pressure2Text, generating
activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps.
Leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat, TxP is trained on
our synthetic PressLang dataset, containing over 81,100 text-pressure pairs.
Validated on real-world data for activities such as yoga and daily tasks, TxP
provides novel approaches to data augmentation and classification grounded in
atomic actions. This consequently improved HAR performance by up to 12.4\% in
macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, advancing pressure-based HAR
with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多维伦理AI采用模型（MEAAM），分析了13个关键伦理变量对医疗AI采用的影响，发现规范性担忧对操作采用影响最大，而全局性担忧对系统性采用影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前框架未能全面理解影响伦理AI采用的多维因素，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用定量横断面研究设计，通过PLS-SEM分析医疗专业人员的调查数据。

Result: 规范性担忧显著影响操作采用，全局性担忧主导系统性采用，认知性担忧增强伦理设计原则的信任和透明度。

Conclusion: MEAAM模型为医疗AI的伦理采用提供了全面、可操作的框架，对政策制定者和技术实施者具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare service
industry presents numerous ethical challenges, yet current frameworks often
fail to offer a comprehensive, empirical understanding of the multidimensional
factors influencing ethical AI integration. Addressing this critical research
gap, this study introduces the Multi-Dimensional Ethical AI Adoption Model
(MEAAM), a novel theoretical framework that categorizes 13 critical ethical
variables across four foundational dimensions of Ethical AI Fair AI,
Responsible AI, Explainable AI, and Sustainable AI. These dimensions are
further analyzed through three core ethical lenses: epistemic concerns (related
to knowledge, transparency, and system trustworthiness), normative concerns
(focused on justice, autonomy, dignity, and moral obligations), and overarching
concerns (highlighting global, systemic, and long-term ethical implications).
This study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional research design using survey
data collected from healthcare professionals and analyzed via Partial Least
Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Employing PLS-SEM, this study
empirically investigates the influence of these ethical constructs on two
outcomes Operational AI Adoption and Systemic AI Adoption. Results indicate
that normative concerns most significantly drive operational adoption
decisions, while overarching concerns predominantly shape systemic adoption
strategies and governance frameworks. Epistemic concerns play a facilitative
role, enhancing the impact of ethical design principles on trust and
transparency in AI systems. By validating the MEAAM framework, this research
advances a holistic, actionable approach to ethical AI adoption in healthcare
and provides critical insights for policymakers, technologists, and healthcare
administrators striving to implement ethically grounded AI solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）代理与数字孪生环境的方法框架，用于自主处理过程工厂中的故障任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动化和人工智能在过程工厂中提升了自主性，但故障处理等任务仍依赖人类专家，需要系统化的知识驱动方法。

Method: 框架通过LLM代理持续解释系统状态并启动控制动作（包括对意外故障的响应），数字孪生则作为知识库和仿真平台验证控制动作。

Result: 在过程工厂的混合模块测试中，框架不仅能自主控制模块，还能通过少量重新提示生成有效的纠正动作以缓解管道堵塞。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM与数字孪生结合在自主故障处理中的潜力，为过程工厂的智能化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence continue to enhance the
autonomy of process plants in handling various operational scenarios. However,
certain tasks, such as fault handling, remain challenging, as they rely heavily
on human expertise. This highlights the need for systematic, knowledge-based
methods. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework that
integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment.
The LLM agents continuously interpret system states and initiate control
actions, including responses to unexpected faults, with the goal of returning
the system to normal operation. In this context, the Digital Twin acts both as
a structured repository of plant-specific engineering knowledge for agent
prompting and as a simulation platform for the systematic validation and
verification of the generated corrective control actions. The evaluation using
a mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is
capable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of
generating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a
few reprompts.

TL;DR: RAICL框架通过检索增强生成和上下文学习，动态选择相似疾病模式的示例，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在疾病分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升多模态大语言模型在疾病分类中的上下文学习效果，通过动态检索信息丰富的示例。

Method: 提出RAICL框架，结合RAG和ICL，利用多种编码器（如ResNet、BERT等）检索相似疾病模式的示例，并构建优化的对话提示。在TCGA和IU Chest X-ray数据集上评估。

Result: RAICL显著提高了分类准确率（TCGA从0.7854到0.8368，IU Chest X-ray从0.7924到0.8658），多模态输入优于单模态，欧氏距离在准确率上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RAICL是一种高效且可扩展的方法，能显著增强多模态大语言模型在疾病分类中的上下文学习能力。

Abstract: Objectives: We aim to dynamically retrieve informative demonstrations,
enhancing in-context learning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for
disease classification.
  Methods: We propose a Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL)
framework, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context
learning (ICL) to adaptively select demonstrations with similar disease
patterns, enabling more effective ICL in MLLMs. Specifically, RAICL examines
embeddings from diverse encoders, including ResNet, BERT, BioBERT, and
ClinicalBERT, to retrieve appropriate demonstrations, and constructs
conversational prompts optimized for ICL. We evaluated the framework on two
real-world multi-modal datasets (TCGA and IU Chest X-ray), assessing its
performance across multiple MLLMs (Qwen, Llava, Gemma), embedding strategies,
similarity metrics, and varying numbers of demonstrations.
  Results: RAICL consistently improved classification performance. Accuracy
increased from 0.7854 to 0.8368 on TCGA and from 0.7924 to 0.8658 on IU Chest
X-ray. Multi-modal inputs outperformed single-modal ones, with text-only inputs
being stronger than images alone. The richness of information embedded in each
modality will determine which embedding model can be used to get better
results. Few-shot experiments showed that increasing the number of retrieved
examples further enhanced performance. Across different similarity metrics,
Euclidean distance achieved the highest accuracy while cosine similarity
yielded better macro-F1 scores. RAICL demonstrated consistent improvements
across various MLLMs, confirming its robustness and versatility.
  Conclusions: RAICL provides an efficient and scalable approach to enhance
in-context learning in MLLMs for multimodal disease classification.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了合作博弈框架中的偏差问题，为自解释模型的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a
cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative
segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset
for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to
maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential
caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias
during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently
create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and
the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset.
Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed
theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction
for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further
introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the
correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two
graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT,
and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent
rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results
than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的注意力机制在处理图结构数据时存在局限性，无法有效建模节点间关系或适应图拓扑结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何处理图结构数据，以理解其注意力机制在图数据上的表现。

Method: 通过实证研究分析LLMs在图结构数据上的注意力行为。

Result: LLMs能识别图数据并捕捉文本-节点交互，但难以建模节点间关系；注意力分布与理想图结构不匹配；完全连接或固定连接的注意力均不理想，中间状态注意力窗口表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs在图结构数据上的注意力机制需改进，中间状态注意力窗口是一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models
(LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for
graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they
fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those
employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does
attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these
observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of
attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The
goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph
structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to
graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of
such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can
recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model
inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural
constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not
align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph
topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity
is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios.
Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance
and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference. Source

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for generating

correctness, often overlooking performance and energy considerations. In this
work, we propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that
generates energy-efficient parallel code on a target parallel system for a
given parallel code as input. Through a multi-stage, iterative pipeline
process, LASSI-EE achieved an average energy reduction of 47% across 85% of the

Conclusion: LLM引导的低复杂度POMDP模型构建方法具有更高的有效性。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making
under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving
POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular,
we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model,
including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and
initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity
probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program.
Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating
candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical
distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of
classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real
mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our
results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity
POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior
cloning, or direct LLM planning.

Abstract: The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially
Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban
applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face
limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of
training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred
approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It
prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in
dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However,
traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs,
structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of
urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large
volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing
requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work
proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary
components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities,
leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The
proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software
components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and
implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in
the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of
Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents demand robust,
standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and
coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are
difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines
four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP),
Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent
Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in distinct deployment
contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool
invocation and typed data exchange. ACP introduces REST-native messaging via
multi-part messages and asynchronous streaming to support multimodal agent
responses. A2A enables peer-to-peer task outsourcing through capability-based
Agent Cards, facilitating enterprise-scale workflows. ANP supports open-network
agent discovery and secure collaboration using decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions,
including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and
security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap
is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for multimodal
messaging, A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for
decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation
for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered
agents.

Conclusion: SafeMate填补了机构知识与公众可访问性之间的鸿沟，提升了应急准备和响应的效率。

Abstract: Despite the abundance of public safety documents and emergency protocols,
most individuals remain ill-equipped to interpret and act on such information
during crises. Traditional emergency decision support systems (EDSS) are
designed for professionals and rely heavily on static documents like PDFs or

Abstract: Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large
language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable
success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these
methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to
extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling
multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree
Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured
planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs
to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer
strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating
diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a
well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework
that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the
hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner
benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement
over o1-preview.

Motivation: 探索大型多模态模型（LMM）在语义通信中的潜力，解决传统方法在资源利用和响应时间上的不足。

Method: 使用LLaVA模型优化图像切片，结合主客观用户注意力评估图像块重要性，调整能量分配以传输关键语义信息。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效优化了资源利用，提升了语义通信性能，尤其在复杂环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication has emerged as a fundamental approach
for enhancing performance in various communication scenarios. While recent
advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as Large Language
Models (LLMs), have been applied to semantic communication designs, the
potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we investigate an LMM-based vehicle AI assistant using a Large Language
and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and propose a task-oriented semantic communication
framework to facilitate efficient interaction between users and cloud servers.
To reduce computational demands and shorten response time, we optimize LLaVA's
image slicing to selectively focus on areas of utmost interest to users.
Additionally, we assess the importance of image patches by combining objective
and subjective user attention, adjusting energy usage for transmitting semantic
information. This strategy optimizes resource utilization, ensuring precise
transmission of critical information. We construct a Visual Question Answering
(VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios to evaluate effectiveness. Experimental
results show that our semantic communication framework significantly increases
accuracy in answering questions under the same channel conditions, performing
particularly well in environments with poor Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR).
Accuracy can be improved by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB,
respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效利用现有模型，提升预测准确性并减少建模成本。

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor
temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in
buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for
various building environments, these models often require extensive data
collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling
process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper
explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models
as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing
accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building
data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we
propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically
select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered
decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the
low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate
the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study,
and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 农业害虫识别因类内差异大和细粒度差异而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖低层次视觉特征且缺乏多模态整合，导致准确性和可解释性不足。

Method: 构建了CTIP102和STIP102多模态基准数据集，提出MSFNet-CPD网络，包括超分辨率重建模块、图像-文本融合模块（ITF）和多尺度图像-文本转换器（ITC），并引入任意组合图像增强策略（ACIE）生成更复杂的数据集MTIP102。

Result: 实验表明MSFNet-CPD在多个害虫检测基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSFNet-CPD通过多模态融合和数据集增强显著提升了害虫检测性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate identification of agricultural pests is essential for crop
protection but remains challenging due to the large intra-class variance and
fine-grained differences among pest species. While deep learning has advanced
pest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual
features and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited
accuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality
multi-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To
address these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and
STIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale
Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach
enhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds
both the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity
and detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an
Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual
features, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained
details across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore,
we introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to
generate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving
the model's generalization to real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MSFNet-CPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on multiple pest detection benchmarks. All code and datasets will be made
publicly available at: https://github.com/Healer-ML/MSFNet-CPD.

Conclusion: iPFL有望成为未来利用分散私有数据提升AI模型性能的关键技术，同时满足各方需求。

Abstract: While data plays a crucial role in training contemporary AI models, it is
acknowledged that valuable public data will be exhausted in a few years,
directing the world's attention towards the massive decentralized private data.
However, the privacy-sensitive nature of raw data and lack of incentive
mechanism prevent these valuable data from being fully exploited. Addressing
these challenges, this paper proposes inclusive and incentivized personalized
federated learning (iPFL), which incentivizes data holders with diverse
purposes to collaboratively train personalized models without revealing raw
data. iPFL constructs a model-sharing market by solving a graph-based training
optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory
principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL adheres to two key incentive
properties: individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on
eleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks)
demonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and
better or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We
anticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future
AI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能和执行时间仍不足，且需要额外监督。RDD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RDD是一种可扩展的分治法，支持子任务依赖和错误恢复机制，无需任务特定指导即可直接应用。

Result: 在两种基准测试中，RDD在任务复杂度增加时优于其他方法，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RDD为复杂推理任务提供了一种高效、低监督的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and
engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in
reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most
prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems
in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require
additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this
work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable
divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less
supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new
problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore,
RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of
sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes
made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six
difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific
examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other
methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also
being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial
intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human
values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about
control and existential risk have escalated. This paper demonstrates that
achieving complete alignment is inherently unattainable due to mathematical
principles rooted in the foundations of predicate logic and computability, in
particular Turing's computational universality, G\"odel's incompleteness and
Chaitin's randomness. Instead, we argue that embracing AI misalignment or
agent's `neurodivergence' as a contingent strategy, defined as fostering a
dynamic ecosystem of competing, partially aligned agents, is a possible only
viable path to mitigate risks. Through mathematical proofs and an experimental
design, we explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a
counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned AI
to human values, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The
main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because
full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete
systems which we also prove in this paper, a feature then inherited to AGI and
ASI systems. We introduce and test `change-of-opinion' attacks based on this
kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may
neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation, competition or
malice.

Abstract: This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models
(LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by
human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These
models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically
during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical
diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning
LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it
charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable
efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories:
(1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity
via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines
decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks,
reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks
(e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with
manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions
of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is
crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from
scientific discovery to decision support systems.

Method: 采用端到端架构，结合层次化多尺度Transformer，整合大型语言模型的推理能力和声学建模，支持个性化语音生成和低延迟对话。

Result: Voila的响应延迟仅为195毫秒，超过人类平均反应时间，支持百万种预建语音和高效定制，适用于多种语音应用。

Conclusion: Voila为下一代人机交互提供了开源解决方案，推动了语音AI技术的发展。

Abstract: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with
humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather
than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and
respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant
interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation
models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional
pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables
full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such
as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195
milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical
multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware
voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define
the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila
supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new
ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue,
Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based
applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech
(TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is
fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward
next-generation human-machine interactions.

Conclusion: 目标漂移是语言模型代理的普遍现象，需进一步研究以提升其长期目标一致性。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe
operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without
human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift.
Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its
original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can
shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a
novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents
are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to
competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while
the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains
nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most
difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal
drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing
susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows.

Method: 通过从全国性脓毒症注册数据构建推理密集型问题，使用强化学习对Phi-4进行微调，开发了C-Reason模型。

Result: C-Reason在领域内测试集上表现出强大的临床推理能力，并能泛化到其他任务和疾病。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注利用大规模、多疾病临床数据集训练LLMs，以开发更强大的通用临床推理模型。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical
practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to
real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not
included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the
clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data.
We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry
and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting
in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the
in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert
evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a
sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended
consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research
should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets
to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数学推理基准在范围和规模上的局限性，推动形式化数学推理的研究。

Method: 提出人机协作的自动形式化流程，结合LLM的自动形式化、语义验证和否定过滤策略。

Result: 在实用采样预算下，最强LLM模型的成功率仅为16.46%，且存在领域偏差和过度依赖简化策略的问题。

Conclusion: FormalMATH为形式化数学推理提供了稳健的基准，揭示了LLM在复杂数学推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial
intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and
scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark
comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad
challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g.,
algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete
mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we
introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates:
(1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization,
(2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering
strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert
annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification
while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant
limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under
practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling
in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation
tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between
natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought
reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning
introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We
believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal
mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在ASD领域的应用潜力，以提升诊断准确性和干预效果。

Method: 利用深度学习算法分析生物特征数据、视频互动评估和语言特征提取，并结合教育机器人和自适应通信工具进行干预。

Result: AI技术显著提高了ASD诊断的准确性和时效性，同时增强了干预效果，如社交技能提升和语言发展支持。

Conclusion: AI是ASD诊断和干预的创新工具，但需进一步研究评估其长期影响和个性化需求。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool for
diagnosis, assessment, and intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD). It focuses particularly on AI's role in early diagnosis,
utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis. Recent
studies demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can identify behavioral
patterns through biometric data analysis, video-based interaction assessments,
and linguistic feature extraction, providing a more accurate and timely
diagnosis compared to traditional methods. Additionally, AI automates
diagnostic tools, reducing subjective biases and enabling the development of
personalized assessment protocols for ASD monitoring. At the same time, the
paper examines AI-powered intervention technologies, emphasizing educational
robots and adaptive communication tools. Social robotic assistants, such as NAO
and Kaspar, have been shown to enhance social skills in children by offering
structured, repetitive interactions that reinforce learning. Furthermore,
AI-driven Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow
children with ASD to express themselves more effectively, while
machine-learning chatbots provide language development support through
personalized responses. The study presents research findings supporting the
effectiveness of these AI applications while addressing challenges such as
long-term evaluation and customization to individual needs. In conclusion, the
paper highlights the significance of AI as an innovative tool in ASD diagnosis
and intervention, advocating for further research to assess its long-term
impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引导生物系统达到期望状态（如形态发生结果）是医学和合成生物学中的基础挑战，但目前尚未探索利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为中介来控制生物或细胞动态。

Method: 结合大型语言模型和可进化神经控制器（Prompt-to-Intervention, P2I），通过进化策略优化，生成模拟2D环境中的行为（如聚集或分散）。

Result: 即使词汇受限且细胞模型简化，P2I网络仍能成功将细胞动态与用户定义的自然语言目标对齐。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来实现自然语言驱动的细胞控制系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic
outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for
medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled
natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their
use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural
language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated
cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an
evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via
evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering
in a simulated 2D environment.
  We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell
models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with
user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete
loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to
behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural
language-driven cellular control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种局部图类（LEG）及其算法LocPC和LocPC-CDE，用于识别控制直接效应（CDE），减少计算负担和假设依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局图结构且计算复杂，而真实图结构通常未知，因此需要更实用、高效的局部方法。

Method: 定义了局部图类（LEG），提出LocPC算法通过局部条件独立性测试恢复LEG，并进一步开发LocPC-CDE算法识别CDE。

Result: 相比全局方法，LocPC和LocPC-CDE减少了条件独立性测试需求，并在较弱假设下保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 局部方法为识别CDE提供了更高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial
across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing
methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs,
which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same
set of d-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative.
However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and
typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we
characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable,
that share a specific subset of d-separations, and introduce a graphical
representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then
present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed
distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on
LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG
that is sufficient to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full
essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less
conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while
maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Result: 实验表明SIM-RAG在多轮RAG任务中表现优异，且系统高效、数据高效。

Conclusion: SIM-RAG为多轮RAG提供了一种高效解决方案，无需修改现有LLM或搜索引擎，且无需人工标注数据。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing
language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving
its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval
remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a
good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue
searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may
provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.
Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled
process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.
  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,
\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and
multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system
self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs
with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic
training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,
which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and
unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information
sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG
system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval
decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context
reinforcement learning.
  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an
effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is
system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring
modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,
eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process
supervision data.

TL;DR: AutoLibra是一个框架，通过将开放式人类反馈转化为具体的行为评估指标，优化语言代理的评估和改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代理评估方法依赖粗粒度的任务成功指标，缺乏对中间行为的奖励，且需要专家手动设计。

Method: AutoLibra通过将反馈与代理行为关联、聚类正负行为，并生成具体指标，利用LLM作为评估器。还提出两个元指标（覆盖率和冗余度）优化指标质量。

Result: 实验表明AutoLibra能生成更具体的评估指标，并在文本游戏任务中提升代理性能20%，同时优化网页导航代理的微调数据选择。

Conclusion: AutoLibra是一种强大的任务无关工具，可用于语言代理的评估和改进。

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics,
which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward
intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent
evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that
the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much
autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating
fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by
grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and
negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and
concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as
evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a
set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy".
Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate
AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the
ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics
to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent
improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better
prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text
game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second,
we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for
web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful
task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI是可信AI的核心，但提供解释可能引发隐私问题，因此需要研究如何平衡隐私与可解释性。

Method: 采用标准范围综述方法，从1943项研究中筛选57篇文献，回答三个研究问题。

Result: 总结了XAI中的隐私风险和保护方法，提出了隐私保护解释的特征，并指出了平衡隐私与其他需求的挑战。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了隐私与可解释性的复杂关系，为隐私合规的XAI提供了研究方向和建议。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of
Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque
by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an
urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this
additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping
review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy
and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we
extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to
December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers
with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of
releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers
employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a
privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the
selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in
XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid
researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is
privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with
other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy
preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex
relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental
principles of Trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Segmentation models can recognize a pre-defined set of objects in images.
However, models that can reason over complex user queries that implicitly refer
to multiple objects of interest are still in their infancy. Recent advances in
reasoning segmentation--generating segmentation masks from complex, implicit
query text--demonstrate that vision-language models can operate across an open
domain and produce reasonable outputs. However, our experiments show that such
models struggle with complex remote-sensing imagery. In this work, we introduce
LISAt, a vision-language model designed to describe complex remote-sensing
scenes, answer questions about them, and segment objects of interest. We
trained LISAt on a new curated geospatial reasoning-segmentation dataset, GRES,
with 27,615 annotations over 9,205 images, and a multimodal pretraining
dataset, PreGRES, containing over 1 million question-answer pairs. LISAt
outperforms existing geospatial foundation models such as RS-GPT4V by over
10.04 % (BLEU-4) on remote-sensing description tasks, and surpasses
state-of-the-art open-domain models on reasoning segmentation tasks by 143.36 %

Motivation: 探索矩阵拼接后奇异值谱的稳定性及其与子矩阵谱的关系，为矩阵聚类和压缩提供理论基础。

Method: 开发了一种扰动框架，扩展了Weyl不等式等经典结果，建立了奇异值在子矩阵小扰动下的稳定性界限。

Result: 若拼接矩阵在范数上接近，拼接后矩阵的主导奇异值保持稳定，支持精度与压缩的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果为矩阵聚类、压缩及数值线性代数、信号处理等领域的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures
in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations.
However, a fundamental question arises: how does the singular value spectrum of
the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In
this work, we develop a perturbation framework that extends classical results
such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We establish analytical
bounds that quantify the stability of singular values under small perturbations
in the submatrices. Our results show that if the matrices being concatenated
are close in norm, the dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix
remain stable, enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression.
These insights provide a theoretical foundation for improved matrix clustering
and compression strategies, with applications in numerical linear algebra,
signal processing, and data-driven modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了动态加载下应力场的生成和超分辨率问题，尤其适用于捕捉应力集中区域。

Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and
performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in
materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in
two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often
associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key
locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering
applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data
and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for
deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress
fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In
this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and
spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we
introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress
Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data.
This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically
investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy.
Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal
super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed
Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning
method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights
on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based
constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during
training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to
arbitrary magnifications.

Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for
improving performance and adaptability.

Motivation: 注塑过程中产品质量偏差的根源分析需要可解释的模型，但现有机器学习模型多为黑箱，且可解释性方法有限或可能误导根源识别。

Method: 研究首先验证了输入机器设置间的交互作用，然后首次比较了模型无关的可解释AI方法，分析了随机森林和多层感知机模型的特征影响。

Result: 实验表明，不同可解释性方法会导致不同的特征影响分析，而更好的特征归因能够正确识别根源并提供可操作的改进建议。

Conclusion: 模型无关的可解释性方法能够有效支持注塑过程的质量控制，但需注意不同方法可能导致不同的根源识别结果。

Abstract: If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding
process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input
machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning
models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no
direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their
applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability
methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize
on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause
identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study
first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do
exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design.
Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time
to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature
impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better
feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and
actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic,
explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for
the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of
less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation aims to separate sounding objects from videos by
predicting pixel-level masks based on audio signals. Existing methods primarily
concentrate on closed-set scenarios and direct audio-visual alignment and

In this paper, we propose OpenAVS, a novel training-free language-based
approach that, for the first time, effectively aligns audio and visual
modalities using text as a proxy for open-vocabulary Audio-Visual Segmentation
(AVS). Equipped with multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS directly infers
masks through 1) audio-to-text prompt generation, 2) LLM-guided prompt
translation, and 3) text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The objective
of OpenAVS is to establish a simple yet flexible architecture that relies on
the most appropriate foundation models by fully leveraging their capabilities
to enable more effective knowledge transfer to the downstream AVS task.
Moreover, we present a model-agnostic framework OpenAVS-ST that enables the
integration of OpenAVS with any advanced supervised AVS model via pseudo-label
based self-training. This approach enhances performance by effectively
utilizing large-scale unlabeled data when available. Comprehensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of OpenAVS. It
surpasses existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods by a
significant margin, achieving absolute performance gains of approximately 9.4%
and 10.9% in mIoU and F-score, respectively, in challenging scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限情况下，如何准确预测LLM适应策略的性能和成本，避免昂贵的实验。

Method: 提出COSMOS框架，结合嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型和低样本扩展法则，预测微调性能和检索增强的上下文学习效果。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COSMOS平均降低计算成本92.72%，最高达98.71%，同时保持高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 高效预测LLM适应策略的可行性，显著减少计算开销，同时维持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Abstract: Movie dubbing has advanced significantly, yet assessing the real-world

Abstract: The increasing automation of traffic management systems has made them prime
targets for cyberattacks, disrupting urban mobility and public safety.
Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation
agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on
traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic
environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption
patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system,
demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key
indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and
diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary
challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase
traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in
low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic
security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart
transportation systems.

exploitation via the Metasploit framework. We try to answer the research
questions: are we able to identify cyber attacks by only analyzing traffic flow
patterns. In this research, the cyber attacks are focused particularly when
lights are randomly turned all green or red at busy intersections by
adversarial attackers. Despite challenges stemming from imbalanced data and
overlapping traffic patterns, our best model shows 85\% accuracy when detecting
intrusions purely using traffic flow statistics. Key indicators for successful
detection included occupancy, jam length, and halting durations.

select the most informative and representative training examples. The final
goal is to achieve near-full dataset performance with meticulously selected

cost and training time and achieving competitive performance as the full

(CoT) loss to identify challenging examples that contribute most to model
learning, while the diversity metric ensures broad coverage across mathematical
subdomains. We evaluate our method on LLaMA-3 8B and Phi-3 models, comparing
against several baseline approaches, including random selection,
diversity-based sampling, and existing state-of-the-art subset selection
techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了“上下文理论”，系统地表征了基础模型学习的表示，指出许多表示学习方法可以视为从输入与上下文变量的关联中学习。理论表明，模型规模足够大后，进一步扩展收益递减，需改进上下文质量。


<details>

Motivation: 缺乏对基础模型学习表示的系统性表征，需要一种理论框架统一解释不同学习范式中的表示学习。

Method: 提出上下文理论，证明多种学习范式（监督、自监督、流形学习）的表示学习均可视为学习上下文关联的顶部奇异函数。

Result: 表示学习上下文关联的模型在兼容任务上表现最优，模型规模足够后扩展收益递减，需优化上下文质量。

Conclusion: 上下文理论为表示学习提供了统一视角，模型规模扩展并非唯一改进途径，上下文质量是关键。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a
systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In
this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of
representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the
association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show
that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of
the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the
representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the
contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various
learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can
all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations
that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with
the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once
the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further
scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not
all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we
study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the
downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it
correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real
datasets.

Motivation: 当前资源适应方法主要基于静态假设，而数据驱动的强化学习方法在动态网络条件下存在神经网络可塑性损失的问题。

Method: 提出了静默神经元理论，并基于此开发了ReSiN方法，通过前向和反向传播状态指导神经元重置来保持可塑性。

Result: 在自适应视频流系统中，ReSiN实现了高达168%的比特率提升和108%的QoE改善，同时在静态环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: ReSiN是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，适用于动态和静态网络条件。

Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges
for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on
stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches
offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic
investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from
plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving
network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation
mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately
characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have
developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive
framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural
plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward
propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming
system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions,
achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE)
while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently
outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability
across different network conditions.

Abstract: As a basic human need, housing plays a key role in enhancing health,
well-being, and educational outcome in society, and the housing market is a
major factor for promoting quality of life and ensuring social equity. To
improve the housing conditions, there has been extensive research on building
Machine Learning (ML)-driven house price prediction solutions to accurately
forecast the future conditions, and help inform actions and policies in the
field. In spite of their success in developing high-accuracy models, there is a
gap in our understanding of the extent to which various ML-driven house price
prediction approaches show ethnic and/or racial bias, which in turn is
essential for the responsible use of ML, and ensuring that the ML-driven
solutions do not exacerbate inequity. To fill this gap, this paper develops
several ML models from a combination of structural and neighborhood-level
attributes, and conducts comprehensive assessments on the fairness of ML models
under various definitions of privileged groups. As a result, it finds that the
ML-driven house price prediction models show various levels of bias towards
protected attributes (i.e., race and ethnicity in this study). Then, it
investigates the performance of different bias mitigation solutions, and the
experimental results show their various levels of effectiveness on different
ML-driven methods. However, in general, the in-processing bias mitigation
approach tends to be more effective than the pre-processing one in this problem
domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/wahab1412/housing_fairness.

Result: CompleteP方法实现了12-34%的计算效率提升，并支持更灵活的模型结构设计。

Conclusion: CompleteP是一种高效的参数化方法，显著提升了LLM训练的计算效率和适应性。

Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different
parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer
hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to
transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model
depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up
(expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even
when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may
still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close
to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity.
Finally, we identify and adopt the unique parameterization we call CompleteP
that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers.
CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain
compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware
settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34\% compute
efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor
from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk
predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL
and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the

to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic

approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.

Abstract: The conceptual design phase represents a critical early stage in the product
development process, where designers generate potential solutions that meet
predefined design specifications based on functional requirements. Functional
modeling, a foundational aspect of this phase, enables designers to reason
about product functions before specific structural details are determined. A
widely adopted approach to functional modeling is the
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework, which supports the transformation
of functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the
effectiveness of function-based design is often hindered by the lack of
well-structured and comprehensive functional data. This scarcity can negatively
impact early design decision-making and hinder the development of accurate
behavioral models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
those based on GPT architectures, offer a promising avenue to address this gap.
LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in language understanding and
natural language processing (NLP), making them suitable for automated
classification tasks. This study proposes a novel LLM-based domain adaptation
(DA) framework using fine-tuning for the automated classification of mechanical
assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the
traditionally manual and subjective process of function annotation can be
improved in both accuracy and consistency. A case study demonstrates
fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository
(OSDR), and evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset shows that the
domain-adapted LLM can generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the
semantic representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective
design exploration in early-phase engineering.

Abstract: Fair machine learning seeks to identify and mitigate biases in predictions
against unfavorable populations characterized by demographic attributes, such
as race and gender. Recently, a few works have extended fairness to graph data,
such as social networks, but most of them neglect the causal relationships
among data instances. This paper addresses the prevalent challenge in
fairness-aware ML algorithms, which typically assume Independent and
Identically Distributed (IID) data. We tackle the overlooked domain of non-IID,
graph-based settings where data instances are interconnected, influencing the
outcomes of fairness interventions. We base our research on the Network
Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and posit two main assumptions:
Decomposability and Graph Independence, which enable the computation of
interventional distributions in non-IID settings using the $do$-calculus. Based
on that, we develop the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal
Inference (MPVA) to compute interventional distributions and facilitate
causally fair node classification through estimated interventional
distributions. Empirical evaluations on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that MPVA outperforms conventional methods by effectively
approximating interventional distributions and mitigating bias. The
implications of our findings underscore the potential of causality-based
fairness in complex ML applications, setting the stage for further research
into relaxing the initial assumptions to enhance model fairness.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常呈现长尾分布，导致尾部类别泛化困难。现有方法（如 ImbSAM 和 CC-SAM）在计算效率和控制损失景观之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出 Focal-SAM，通过类别相关的锐度惩罚实现细粒度控制，避免额外反向传播，保持效率。

Result: 在传统和基础模型上的实验验证了 Focal-SAM 的有效性。

Conclusion: Focal-SAM 在保持效率的同时提供了更好的泛化能力，理论分析也支持其优越性。

Abstract: Real-world datasets often follow a long-tailed distribution, making
generalization to tail classes difficult. Recent methods resorted to long-tail
variants of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), such as ImbSAM and CC-SAM, to
improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape. However, these
attempts face a trade-off between computational efficiency and control over the
loss landscape. On the one hand, ImbSAM is efficient but offers only coarse
control as it excludes head classes from the SAM process. On the other hand,
CC-SAM provides fine-grained control through class-dependent perturbations but
at the cost of efficiency due to multiple backpropagations. Seeing this
dilemma, we introduce Focal-SAM, which assigns different penalties to
class-wise sharpness, achieving fine-grained control without extra
backpropagations, thus maintaining efficiency. Furthermore, we theoretically
analyze Focal-SAM's generalization ability and derive a sharper generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on both traditional and foundation models validate
the effectiveness of Focal-SAM.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) is referred to as a training strategy that makes
easy samples learned first and then fits hard samples. It imitates the process
of humans learning knowledge, and has become a potential manner of effectively
training deep networks. In this study, we develop the adaptively
point-weighting (APW) curriculum learning algorithm, which adaptively assigns
the weight to every training sample not only based on its training error but
also considering the current training state of the network. Specifically, in
the early training phase, it increases the weights of easy samples to make the
network rapidly capture the overall characteristics of the dataset; and in the
later training phase, the weights of hard points rise to improve the fitting
performance on the discrete local regions. Moreover, we also present the
theoretical analysis on the properties of APW including training effectiveness,
training feasibility, training stability, and generalization performance. The
numerical experiments support the superiority of APW and demonstrate the
validity of our theoretical findings.

fill this gap, we proposed PoseX, an open-source benchmark focusing on
self-docking and cross-docking, to evaluate the algorithmic advances
practically and comprehensively. Specifically, first, we curate a new
evaluation dataset with 718 entries for self docking and 1,312 for cross
docking; second, we incorporate 22 docking methods across three methodological
categories, including (1) traditional physics-based methods (e.g.,
Schr\"odinger Glide), (2) AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock), (3) AI
co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we design a relaxation method as
post-processing to minimize conformation energy and refine binding pose;
fourth, we released a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real time. We
draw some key insights via extensive experiments: (1) AI-based approaches have
already surpassed traditional physics-based approaches in overall docking
accuracy (RMSD). The longstanding generalization issues that have plagued AI
molecular docking have been significantly alleviated in the latest models. (2)
The stereochemical deficiencies of AI-based approaches can be greatly
alleviated with post-processing relaxation. Combining AI docking methods with
the enhanced relaxation method achieves the best performance to date. (3) AI
co-folding methods commonly face ligand chirality issues, which cannot be
resolved by relaxation. The code, curated dataset and leaderboard are released
at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.

TL;DR: PeSANet结合局部和全局信息，通过物理编码和谱注意力机制，在有限数据和物理先验下提升复杂系统的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法在物理规律不完整或未知时表现不佳，而机器学习方法在数据稀缺和特征捕捉上存在局限。

Method: PeSANet包含物理编码块（近似局部微分算子）和谱增强块（频域捕捉全局依赖），并引入谱注意力机制。

Result: 实验显示PeSANet在所有指标上优于现有方法，尤其在长期预测准确性上表现突出。

Conclusion: PeSANet为有限数据和物理不完整场景下的复杂系统模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in various scientific and engineering
domains. However, traditional numerical methods struggle in real-world
scenarios due to incomplete or unknown physical laws. Meanwhile, machine
learning approaches often fail to generalize effectively when faced with scarce
observational data and the challenge of capturing local and global features. To
this end, we propose the Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet),
which integrates local and global information to forecast complex systems with
limited data and incomplete physical priors. The model consists of two key
components: a physics-encoded block that uses hard constraints to approximate
local differential operators from limited data, and a spectral-enhanced block
that captures long-range global dependencies in the frequency domain.
Specifically, we introduce a novel spectral attention mechanism to model
inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features.
Experimental results demonstrate that PeSANet outperforms existing methods
across all metrics, particularly in long-term forecasting accuracy, providing a
promising solution for simulating complex systems with limited data and
incomplete physics.

Method: 提出VLoRP框架，引入投影粒度控制，并开发ProjFactor优化器。

Result: 实验验证了VLoRP在稳定性和效率上的提升，ProjFactor在减少内存需求的同时保持性能。

Conclusion: VLoRP和ProjFactor为内存高效微调提供了新思路，理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Building upon the success of low-rank adapter (LoRA), low-rank gradient
projection (LoRP) has emerged as a promising solution for memory-efficient
fine-tuning. However, existing LoRP methods typically treat each row of the
gradient matrix as the default projection unit, leaving the role of projection
granularity underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel framework, VLoRP,
that extends low-rank gradient projection by introducing an additional degree
of freedom for controlling the trade-off between memory efficiency and
performance, beyond the rank hyper-parameter. Through this framework, we
systematically explore the impact of projection granularity, demonstrating that
finer-grained projections lead to enhanced stability and efficiency even under
a fixed memory budget. Regarding the optimization for VLoRP, we present
ProjFactor, an adaptive memory-efficient optimizer, that significantly reduces
memory requirement while ensuring competitive performance, even in the presence
of gradient accumulation. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of
VLoRP, demonstrating the descent and convergence of its optimization trajectory
under both SGD and ProjFactor. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate
our findings, covering tasks such as commonsense reasoning, MMLU, and GSM8K.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文感知的预测驱动在线异常检测方法（C-PP-COAD），通过结合合成校准数据和真实数据，减少对真实校准数据的依赖，同时保证虚假发现率（FDR）的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线异常检测在网络安全、医疗和工业监控等领域至关重要，但现有方法通常依赖大量真实校准数据来保证FDR控制。数据稀缺问题亟待解决。

Method: C-PP-COAD利用合成校准数据缓解数据稀缺问题，并基于上下文动态整合真实数据。采用符合性p值、主动p值统计和在线FDR控制机制。

Conclusion: C-PP-COAD为解决数据稀缺问题提供了一种有效方法，同时确保了异常检测的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity,
healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations
from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While
numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning
have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of
real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false
discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real
calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal
online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages
synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively
integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal
p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to
maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time.
Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data
without compromising guaranteed FDR control.

Motivation: 随着物联网技术的发展，高精度室内定位在复杂环境中变得至关重要。传统指纹定位和深度学习方法存在泛化性差、过拟合和可解释性不足的问题，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Abstract: With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, high-precision
indoor positioning has become essential for Location-Based Services (LBS) in
complex indoor environments. Fingerprint-based localization is popular, but
traditional algorithms and deep learning-based methods face challenges such as
poor generalization, overfitting, and lack of interpretability. This paper
applies conformal prediction (CP) to deep learning-based indoor positioning. CP
transforms the uncertainty of the model into a non-conformity score, constructs
prediction sets to ensure correctness coverage, and provides statistical
guarantees. We also introduce conformal risk control for path navigation tasks
to manage the false discovery rate (FDR) and the false negative rate (FNR).The
model achieved an accuracy of approximately 100% on the training dataset and
85% on the testing dataset, effectively demonstrating its performance and
generalization capability. Furthermore, we also develop a conformal p-value
framework to control the proportion of position-error points. Experiments on
the UJIIndoLoc dataset using lightweight models such as MobileNetV1, VGG19,
MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and EfficientNet show that the conformal prediction
technique can effectively approximate the target coverage, and different models
have different performance in terms of prediction set size and uncertainty
quantification.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific modeling,
particularly for complex dynamical systems; however, accurately capturing
age-structured population dynamics under policy-driven fertility changes
remains a significant challenge due to the lack of effective integration
between domain knowledge and long-term temporal dependencies. To address this
issue, we propose two physics-informed deep learning frameworks--PINN and
LSTM-PINN--that incorporate policy-aware fertility functions into a
transport-reaction partial differential equation to simulate population
evolution from 2024 to 2054. The standard PINN model enforces the governing
equation and boundary conditions via collocation-based training, enabling
accurate learning of underlying population dynamics and ensuring stable
convergence. Building on this, the LSTM-PINN framework integrates sequential
memory mechanisms to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the
age-time domain, achieving robust training performance across multiple loss
components. Simulation results under three distinct fertility policy
scenarios-the Three-child policy, the Universal two-child policy, and the
Separate two-child policy--demonstrate the models' ability to reflect
policy-sensitive demographic shifts and highlight the effectiveness of
integrating domain knowledge into data-driven forecasting. This study provides
a novel and extensible framework for modeling age-structured population
dynamics under policy interventions, offering valuable insights for
data-informed demographic forecasting and long-term policy planning in the face
of emerging population challenges.

Abstract: Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful
competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the
relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL
problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which
is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation
process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy
Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and
the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model
obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior
Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target
estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an
intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of
log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate
that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline
reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Motivation: 在分布式学习中，恶意参与者和数据隐私是主要挑战，传统方法需信任中心服务器。本文探索更弱的假设（共享随机种子）以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出CafCor算法，结合鲁棒梯度聚合与相关噪声注入，利用工人间的共享随机性。

Result: CafCor在隐私-效用权衡上表现优异，优于本地差分隐私方法，接近中心差分隐私的效用。

Conclusion: 隐私与鲁棒性可在不牺牲效用或信任服务器的情况下共存于分布式系统。

Abstract: Resilience against malicious parties and data privacy are essential for
trustworthy distributed learning, yet achieving both with good utility
typically requires the strong assumption of a trusted central server. This
paper shows that a significantly weaker assumption suffices: each pair of
workers shares a randomness seed unknown to others. In a setting where
malicious workers may collude with an untrusted server, we propose CafCor, an
algorithm that integrates robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise
injection, leveraging shared randomness between workers. We prove that CafCor
achieves strong privacy-utility trade-offs, significantly outperforming local
differential privacy (DP) methods, which do not make any trust assumption,
while approaching central DP utility, where the server is fully trusted.
Empirical results on standard benchmarks validate CafCor's practicality,
showing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without
sacrificing utility or trusting the server.

TL;DR: ONNX Optimizer缺乏对模型精度保留的严格验证，OODTE工具通过差分测试评估其正确性，发现多个未知问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ONNX Optimizer作为标准工具，其优化后模型精度保留能力未被充分验证，需自动化工具评估其正确性。

Method: OODTE采用差分测试方法，对ONNX模型进行优化前后对比，自动记录问题并定位根源。

Result: 测试130个模型，发现15个问题（14个未知），9.2%模型导致优化器崩溃，30%分类模型精度差异。

Conclusion: OODTE有效发现ONNX Optimizer问题，验证其优化过程存在潜在风险，需进一步改进。

Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX
Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on
ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across
optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to
automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer.
OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation
approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In
particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and
executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set
of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization
process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the
results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats
the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of
the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from
the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification,
object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and
answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15
issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes
and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances
presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of
an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition,
$30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the
original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic
segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a
limited extent.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of FIFA World Cup match outcomes holds significant value

capture nuanced interactions often overlooked by traditional aggregate models.
Our methodology processes multi-year data to create year-specific team profiles

classification techniques complemented by dimensionality reduction and
hyperparameter optimization, to yield robust predictive models. Experimental
results on data from the FIFA 2022 World Cup demonstrate our approach's
superior accuracy compared to baseline method. Our findings highlight the
importance of incorporating individual player attributes and team-level
composition to enhance predictive performance, offering new insights into
player synergy, strategic match-ups, and tournament progression scenarios. This
work underscores the transformative potential of rich, player-centric data in
sports analytics, setting a foundation for future exploration of advanced
learning architectures such as graph neural networks to model complex team

Motivation: 现有方法在生成与常见学生错误一致的干扰项方面存在局限，LookAlike旨在通过偏好优化解决这一问题。

Result: 在1400+数学多选问题数据集上，LookAlike在干扰项生成和错误生成上分别达到51.6%和57.2%的准确率，优于现有方法（45.6% / 47.7%）。

Conclusion: 偏好优化和不一致性挖掘能有效提升数学多选问题干扰项的生成一致性，且具有可扩展性和稳定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate distractors
for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), especially in domains like math
education. However, existing approaches are limited in ensuring that the
generated distractors are consistent with common student errors. We propose
LookAlike, a method that improves error-distractor consistency via preference
optimization. Our two main innovations are: (a) mining synthetic preference
pairs from model inconsistencies, and (b) alternating supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to stabilize training. Unlike
prior work that relies on heuristics or manually annotated preference data,
LookAlike uses its own generation inconsistencies as dispreferred samples, thus
enabling scalable and stable training. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of
1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation
and 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an
existing state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%). These improvements highlight
the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining
for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in
data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models
are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively
expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel
molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate
out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize
OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular
OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for
$\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular
property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution
models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than
140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep
learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing
models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top
performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution.
We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on
OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models
with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited
training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show
strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation
experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation,
pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular
representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD
generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development.
This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Motivation: 研究目的是探索现代机器学习技术如何提升实时失业率预测的准确性，为经济学家和政策制定者提供更丰富的劳动力市场趋势洞察。

Method: 使用了七种模型（线性回归、SGDRegressor、随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost、支持向量回归和LSTM网络），输入特征包括宏观经济指标、劳动力市场数据和金融变量等。通过交叉验证调整超参数，并评估预测性能。

Result: 基于树的集成方法（特别是CatBoost）和LSTM网络表现优于线性模型，支持向量回归和SGDRegressor略有提升但不如集成和深度学习模型稳定。

Conclusion: 现代机器学习技术（尤其是集成和深度学习方法）能显著提升失业率预测的准确性，为政策制定提供更可靠的依据。

Abstract: In this paper, I explored how a range of regression and machine learning
techniques can be applied to monthly U.S. unemployment data to produce timely
forecasts. I compared seven models: Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, Random
Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression, and an LSTM network,
training each on a historical span of data and then evaluating on a later
hold-out period. Input features include macro indicators (GDP growth, CPI),
labor market measures (job openings, initial claims), financial variables
(interest rates, equity indices), and consumer sentiment.
  I tuned model hyperparameters via cross-validation and assessed performance
with standard error metrics and the ability to predict the correct unemployment
direction. Across the board, tree-based ensembles (and CatBoost in particular)
deliver noticeably better forecasts than simple linear approaches, while the
LSTM captures underlying temporal patterns more effectively than other
nonlinear methods. SVR and SGDRegressor yield modest gains over standard
regression but don't match the consistency of the ensemble and deep-learning
models.
  Interpretability tools ,feature importance rankings and SHAP values, point to
job openings and consumer sentiment as the most influential predictors across
all methods. By directly comparing linear, ensemble, and deep-learning
approaches on the same dataset, our study shows how modern machine-learning
techniques can enhance real-time unemployment forecasting, offering economists
and policymakers richer insights into labor market trends.
  In the comparative evaluation of the models, I employed a dataset comprising
thirty distinct features over the period from January 2020 through December
2024.

Conclusion: MSGL和ASYNC-MSGL方法通过多尺度学习和跨尺度连接，显著提升了细尺度水温预测的准确性。

Abstract: Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within
the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine
spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise
interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although
spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time
series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to
the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient
fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This
method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph
learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale
graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods
integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial
correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our
MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation
learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations
across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections,
thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free
from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training
by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL).
Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware
River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources
monitoring and management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用验证器的梯度信息来高效控制语言模型生成的方法，能够满足语义层面的约束（如毒性、情感或礼貌），并通过重新加权下一个词分布实现精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效处理非词汇约束（如毒性或情感），或依赖采样导致低概率事件估计不准确。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用验证器的梯度信息，从初始样本出发构建局部语言模型分布，计算期望句子嵌入，并以此估计约束满足概率，从而更新下一个词分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在控制毒性、情感和主题一致性方面效果显著，约束满足概率超过95%，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过梯度信息实现了对语言模型生成的高效精确控制，适用于多种语义约束。

Abstract: Semantic control entails steering LM generations towards satisfying subtle
non-lexical constraints, e.g., toxicity, sentiment, or politeness, attributes
that can be captured by a sequence-level verifier. It can thus be viewed as
sampling from the LM distribution conditioned on the target attribute, a
computationally intractable problem due to the non-decomposable nature of the
verifier. Existing approaches to LM control either only deal with syntactic
constraints which cannot capture the aforementioned attributes, or rely on
sampling to explore the conditional LM distribution, an ineffective estimator
for low-probability events. In this work, we leverage a verifier's gradient
information to efficiently reason over all generations that satisfy the target
attribute, enabling precise steering of LM generations by reweighing the
next-token distribution. Starting from an initial sample, we create a local LM
distribution favoring semantically similar sentences. This approximation
enables the tractable computation of an expected sentence embedding. We use
this expected embedding, informed by the verifier's evaluation at the initial
sample, to estimate the probability of satisfying the constraint, which
directly informs the update to the next-token distribution. We evaluated the
effectiveness of our approach in controlling the toxicity, sentiment, and
topic-adherence of LMs yielding generations satisfying the constraint with high
probability (>95%) without degrading their quality.

TL;DR: EnsembleCI是一种基于集成学习的自适应方法，用于碳强度（CI）预测，优于现有方法CarbonCast，平均提升预测精度19.58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法CarbonCast无法解决区域变异性和适应性不足的问题，限制了碳强度预测的准确性。

Method: EnsembleCI通过加权多个子学习器的预测结果，提供更高的灵活性和区域适应性。

Result: 在11个区域电网的评估中，EnsembleCI在几乎所有电网中均表现最优，平均MAPE降低19.58%。

Conclusion: EnsembleCI是一种更准确、可靠的碳强度预测解决方案，具有更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Carbon intensity (CI) measures the average carbon emissions generated per
unit of electricity, making it a crucial metric for quantifying and managing
the environmental impact. Accurate CI predictions are vital for minimizing
carbon footprints, yet the state-of-the-art method (CarbonCast) falls short due
to its inability to address regional variability and lack of adaptability. To
address these limitations, we introduce EnsembleCI, an adaptive, end-to-end
ensemble learning-based approach for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI combines
weighted predictions from multiple sublearners, offering enhanced flexibility
and regional adaptability. In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI
consistently surpasses CarbonCast, achieving the lowest mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) in almost all grids and improving prediction accuracy
by an average of 19.58%. While performance still varies across grids due to
inherent regional diversity, EnsembleCI reduces variability and exhibits
greater robustness in long-term forecasting compared to CarbonCast and
identifies region-specific key features, underscoring its interpretability and
practical relevance. These findings position EnsembleCI as a more accurate and
reliable solution for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI source code and data used in
this paper are available at https://github.com/emmayly/EnsembleCI.

TL;DR: D3HRL是一种因果分层强化学习方法，通过建模延迟效应和消除虚假相关性，提升复杂环境中的决策可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分层强化学习算法在长时程任务中表现优异，但仍面临延迟效应和虚假相关性两大挑战。

Method: D3HRL通过分布式因果发现建模延迟效应，利用条件独立性测试消除虚假相关性，并基于真实因果关系构建分层策略。

Result: 在2D-MineCraft和MiniGrid实验中，D3HRL表现出对延迟效应的高敏感性和准确识别因果关系的能力。

Conclusion: D3HRL通过因果建模显著提升了复杂环境中的决策可靠性。

Abstract: Current Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) algorithms excel in
long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks but still face two challenges:
delay effects and spurious correlations. To address them, we propose a causal
HRL approach called D3HRL. First, D3HRL models delayed effects as causal
relationships across different time spans and employs distributed causal
discovery to learn these relationships. Second, it employs conditional
independence testing to eliminate spurious correlations. Finally, D3HRL
constructs and trains hierarchical policies based on the identified true causal
relationships. These three steps are iteratively executed, gradually exploring
the complete causal chain of the task. Experiments conducted in 2D-MineCraft
and MiniGrid show that D3HRL demonstrates superior sensitivity to delay effects
and accurately identifies causal relationships, leading to reliable
decision-making in complex environments.

TL;DR: 现代视觉变换器（ViTs）中的自注意力机制在训练时会失败，除非与跳跃连接结合使用。本文理论分析了自注意力机制的根本问题，并提出了一种新方法Token Graying来改善输入令牌的条件。


<details>

Motivation: 研究自注意力机制在ViTs中为何对跳跃连接有独特依赖，以及如何通过理论分析和新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 理论分析自注意力机制的病态性，并提出Token Graying作为跳跃连接的补充方法。

Result: 实验验证了Token Graying在监督和自监督训练中的有效性。

Conclusion: 自注意力机制在ViTs中需要跳跃连接进行正则化，而Token Graying进一步改善了训练条件。

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers
(ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it
is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other
elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal)
when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical
dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous
deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In
this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is
fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip
connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a
simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the
condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and
self-supervised training methods.

Conclusion: 通过领域知识微调和校准感知策略，可以有效解决偏好对齐导致的校准问题，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment
is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically
well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with
human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment
affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we
observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes
to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor
calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with
domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further
analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into
two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected
Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a
calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without
compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for
better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we
develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to
maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting is critical for applications
such as weather prediction, and traffic analysis. In addition, the
implementation of Transformer variants has improved prediction accuracy.
Following these variants, different input data process approaches also enhanced
the field, such as tokenization techniques including point-wise, channel-wise,
and patch-wise tokenization. However, previous studies still have limitations
in time complexity, computational resources, and cross-dimensional
interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN
Autoencoder-based Score Attention mechanism (CASA), which can be introduced in
diverse Transformers model-agnosticically by reducing memory and leading to
improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets

Motivation: 当前GCN在节点分类任务中占主导地位，但存在异质性和表达能力问题，且忽视了节点特征的潜在作用。

Conclusion: GCNIII通过结合Wide & Deep架构和新技术，提升了节点分类任务的性能，并探索了LLMs在节点特征工程中的应用。

Abstract: Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation
systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and
industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized
linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks;
however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and
expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the
potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework
GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three
techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide
comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively
balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various
semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance
of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is

Motivation: 纳米抗体因其独特优势在治疗和诊断中具有重要价值，但纳米抗体特异性建模缺乏统一基准，NbBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入NbBench基准套件，涵盖8个任务和9个数据集，系统评估11种模型（通用蛋白质LM、抗体特异性LM和纳米抗体特异性LM）。

Result: 抗体语言模型在抗原相关任务中表现优异，但回归任务（如热稳定性和亲和力）仍具挑战性，且无单一模型在所有任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: NbBench为纳米抗体建模提供了可重复的评估基础，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelid
heavy-chain-only antibodies, exhibit unique advantages such as compact size,
high stability, and strong binding affinity, making them valuable tools in
therapeutics and diagnostics. While recent advances in pretrained protein and
antibody language models (PPLMs and PALMs) have greatly enhanced biomolecular
understanding, nanobody-specific modeling remains underexplored and lacks a
unified benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce NbBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark suite for nanobody representation learning. Spanning
eight biologically meaningful tasks across nine curated datasets, NbBench
encompasses structure annotation, binding prediction, and developability
assessment. We systematically evaluate eleven representative models--including
general-purpose protein LMs, antibody-specific LMs, and nanobody-specific
LMs--in a frozen setting. Our analysis reveals that antibody language models
excel in antigen-related tasks, while performance on regression tasks such as
thermostability and affinity remains challenging across all models. Notably, no
single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. By standardizing
datasets, task definitions, and evaluation protocols, NbBench offers a
reproducible foundation for assessing and advancing nanobody modeling.

Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models
to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has
gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is
to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing
methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph
prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between
pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing
graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning
ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned
challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method
GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and
using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly,
Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most
informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction.
Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest
neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose
appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally,
we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the
generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive
experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context
learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our
approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is
released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

Abstract: DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression
levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the
identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful
biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features
obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail,
classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are
widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing
high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among
genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational
costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To
overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are
gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as
superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel
processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective
solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods.
In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the
Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data
containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four
different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and
pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy.
Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either
superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the
potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the
analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on
gene expression features.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
generating composite structures, demonstrating considerable promise across
diverse applications. While substantial progress has been made in exploring
their modeling validity and connections to other generative frameworks, the
theoretical understanding of their learning behavior remains largely uncharted.
In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical investigation of GFlowNets'
learning behavior, focusing on four fundamental dimensions: convergence, sample
complexity, implicit regularization, and robustness. By analyzing these
aspects, we seek to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying GFlowNet's
learning dynamics, shedding light on its strengths and limitations. Our
findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing
GFlowNet performance and provide insights into principled guidelines for their
effective design and deployment. This study not only bridges a critical gap in
the theoretical landscape of GFlowNets but also lays the foundation for their
evolution as a reliable and interpretable framework for generative modeling.
Through this, we aspire to advance the theoretical frontiers of GFlowNets and
catalyze their broader adoption in the AI community.

Conclusion: 新方法在神经逻辑赌博问题中显著提升了性能，减少了维度依赖。

Abstract: We study the problem of neural logistic bandits, where the main task is to
learn an unknown reward function within a logistic link function using a neural
network. Existing approaches either exhibit unfavorable dependencies on
$\kappa$, where $1/\kappa$ represents the minimum variance of reward
distributions, or suffer from direct dependence on the feature dimension $d$,
which can be huge in neural network-based settings. In this work, we introduce
a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales
that is designed to bypass a direct dependence on the ambient dimension. This
lets us deduce a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension
$\widetilde{d}$, not the feature dimension, while keeping a minimal dependence
on $\kappa$. Based on the concentration inequality, we propose two algorithms,
NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, that guarantee regret upper bounds of
order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and
$\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively, improving on the
existing results. Lastly, we report numerical results on both synthetic and
real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

Result: 提出的集成方法在防御性能上优于PGD对抗训练，计算资源消耗仅为后者的三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间序列分类对抗防御提供了高效解决方案，并为未来结合大规模预训练模型的研究提供了启示。

Abstract: As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC
models against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is
well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on
adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper,
five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are
developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing
the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model.
Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By
leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One
of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only
provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the
generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources
required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for
PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as
foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning,
our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial
defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.

Abstract: World modelling, i.e. building a representation of the rules that govern the
world so as to predict its evolution, is an essential ability for any agent
interacting with the physical world. Despite their impressive performance, many
solutions fail to learn a causal representation of the environment they are
trying to model, which would be necessary to gain a deep enough understanding
of the world to perform complex tasks. With this work, we aim to broaden the
research in the intersection of causality theory and neural world modelling by
assessing the potential for causal discovery of the State Space Model (SSM)
architecture, which has been shown to have several advantages over the
widespread Transformer. We show empirically that, compared to an equivalent
Transformer, a SSM can model the dynamics of a simple environment and learn a
causal model at the same time with equivalent or better performance, thus
paving the way for further experiments that lean into the strength of SSMs and
further enhance them with causal awareness.

Abstract: We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction
Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While
existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction
demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories
that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and
transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations,
there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge
between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a
continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon
this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched
Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between
demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes
unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood.
To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory
Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical
encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables
robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference
demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks
demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of
convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.

TL;DR: GRAIL利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和自动提示调优生成程序来计算图编辑距离（GED），解决了传统神经方法的局限性，如数据需求大、可解释性差和跨域泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经方法在计算GED时面临数据需求大、可解释性差和跨域泛化能力不足的问题，GRAIL旨在通过生成程序而非预测GED来解决这些问题。

Method: GRAIL结合大型语言模型和自动提示调优，生成用于计算GED的程序，实现了端到端的可解释性和无需监督的自进化学习机制。

Result: 在七个数据集上的实验表明，GRAIL在预测质量和跨域泛化能力上均优于现有最优的GED近似方法。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过生成程序的方式，显著提升了GED计算的效率、可解释性和泛化能力，为图相似性度量领域带来了范式转变。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely used metric for measuring similarity
between two graphs. Computing the optimal GED is NP-hard, leading to the
development of various neural and non-neural heuristics. While neural methods
have achieved improved approximation quality compared to non-neural approaches,
they face significant challenges: (1) They require large amounts of ground
truth data, which is itself NP-hard to compute. (2) They operate as black
boxes, offering limited interpretability. (3) They lack cross-domain
generalization, necessitating expensive retraining for each new dataset. We
address these limitations with GRAIL, introducing a paradigm shift in this
domain. Instead of training a neural model to predict GED, GRAIL employs a
novel combination of large language models (LLMs) and automated prompt tuning
to generate a program that is used to compute GED. This shift from predicting
GED to generating programs imparts various advantages, including end-to-end
interpretability and an autonomous self-evolutionary learning mechanism without
ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on seven datasets confirm that
GRAIL not only surpasses state-of-the-art GED approximation methods in
prediction quality but also achieves robust cross-domain generalization across
diverse graph distributions.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future
observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data
management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent
studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF.
However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the
inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient
MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged
knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future
representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an
effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated
language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of
Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a
subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To
cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged
knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature
distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while
minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer
insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed
TimeKD.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时间域的创新方法，通过可编程延迟线和仲裁器优化和加速Tsetlin Machine中的popcount和argmax操作，显著提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine（TM）是一种轻量级机器学习方法，但其性能受限于popcount和比较操作的高计算成本。

Method: 采用时间域实现，利用可编程延迟线（PDLs）和仲裁器，通过延迟机制高效完成任务，并设计了FPGA实现流程以解决延迟偏差。

Result: 在异步TM中，相比同步TM，实现了延迟降低38%、动态功耗减少43.1%、资源利用率节省15%。

Conclusion: 时间域popcount方法显著提升了TM的性能，展示了其在异步架构中的天然兼容性。

Abstract: Population count (popcount) is a crucial operation for many low-complexity
machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Tsetlin Machine (TM)-a promising
new ML method, particularly well-suited for solving classification tasks. The
inference mechanism in TM consists of propositional logic-based structures
within each class, followed by a majority voting scheme, which makes the
classification decision. In TM, the voters are the outputs of Boolean clauses.
The voting mechanism comprises two operations: popcount for each class and
determining the class with the maximum vote by means of an argmax operation.
  While TMs offer a lightweight ML alternative, their performance is often
limited by the high computational cost of popcount and comparison required to
produce the argmax result. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to
accelerate and optimize these operations by performing them in the time domain.
Our time-domain implementation uses programmable delay lines (PDLs) and
arbiters to efficiently manage these tasks through delay-based mechanisms. We
also present an FPGA design flow for practical implementation of the
time-domain popcount, addressing delay skew and ensuring that the behavior
matches that of the model's intended functionality. By leveraging the natural
compatibility of the proposed popcount with asynchronous architectures, we
demonstrate significant improvements in an asynchronous TM, including up to 38%
reduction in latency, 43.1% reduction in dynamic power, and 15% savings in
resource utilization, compared to synchronous TMs using adder-based popcount.

TL;DR: DNAZEN是一个增强的基因组表示框架，通过学习基因序列中的多粒度信息（如小聚合物和G-grams）来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将语言建模技术应用于基因序列，忽略了不同粒度单元对表示的内在贡献。

Method: 提出DNAZEN框架，通过无监督方法从大规模基因组语料库中提取G-grams，并使用Transformer编码器动态匹配和编码这些G-grams。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验证明了DNAZEN在各种下游任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: DNAZEN通过多粒度学习和动态G-gram匹配，显著提升了基因组表示的性能。

Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting
its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units
and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize
advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to
Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence,
with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and
thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples.
However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to
gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization
in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities
contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced
genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities
in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations
of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from
large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the
G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of
DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A
Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are
fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder
for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and
maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning
process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model
largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an
ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability, a form of
complete counterfactual identifiability within the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH)
framework, ensuring that all Structural Causal Models (SCMs) satisfying the
given assumptions provide consistent answers to all causal questions. To
simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose
$\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model
identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore
sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in
two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual
transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend
$\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize
existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications.
Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in
counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of
our method and the correctness of the theory.

Motivation: 研究Qwen3在资源受限环境中的高效部署问题，探索低比特量化对其性能的影响。

Method: 对Qwen3应用5种经典后训练量化技术，量化比特宽度从1到8位，并在多个数据集上评估其效果。

Result: Qwen3在中比特量化下保持竞争力，但在超低比特量化下语言任务性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以减少极端量化场景下的性能损失，为Qwen3及未来大语言模型的量化方法提供实用指导。

Abstract: The Qwen series has emerged as a leading family of open-source Large Language
Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding tasks. With the recent release of Qwen3, which exhibits superior
performance across diverse benchmarks, there is growing interest in deploying
these models efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Low-bit
quantization presents a promising solution, yet its impact on Qwen3's
performance remains underexplored. This study conducts a systematic evaluation
of Qwen3's robustness under various quantization settings, aiming to uncover
both opportunities and challenges in compressing this state-of-the-art model.
We rigorously assess 5 existing classic post-training quantization techniques
applied to Qwen3, spanning bit-widths from 1 to 8 bits, and evaluate their
effectiveness across multiple datasets. Our findings reveal that while Qwen3
maintains competitive performance at moderate bit-widths, it experiences
notable degradation in linguistic tasks under ultra-low precision, underscoring
the persistent hurdles in LLM compression. These results emphasize the need for
further research to mitigate performance loss in extreme quantization
scenarios. We anticipate that this empirical analysis will provide actionable
insights for advancing quantization methods tailored to Qwen3 and future LLMs,
ultimately enhancing their practicality without compromising accuracy. Our
project is released on https://github.com/Efficient-ML/Qwen3-Quantization and

Result: 实验验证Muon在大批量训练中优于AdamW，模型规模可达40亿参数。

Conclusion: Muon在计算效率和数据效率上表现优异，结合muP参数化能有效提升训练经济性。

Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order
optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the
compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in
retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called
critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling
more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal
update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present
a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP
while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings
through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters
and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.

of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world
model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl,

performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and
manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over

Abstract: Federated causal inference enables multi-site treatment effect estimation
without sharing individual-level data, offering a privacy-preserving solution
for real-world evidence generation. However, data heterogeneity across sites,
manifested in differences in covariate, treatment, and outcome, poses
significant challenges for unbiased and efficient estimation. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive review and theoretical analysis of federated causal
effect estimation across both binary/continuous and time-to-event outcomes. We
classify existing methods into weight-based strategies and optimization-based
frameworks and further discuss extensions including personalized models,
peer-to-peer communication, and model decomposition. For time-to-event
outcomes, we examine federated Cox and Aalen-Johansen models, deriving
asymptotic bias and variance under heterogeneity. Our analysis reveals that
FedProx-style regularization achieves near-optimal bias-variance trade-offs
compared to naive averaging and meta-analysis. We review related software tools
and conclude by outlining opportunities, challenges, and future directions for
scalable, fair, and trustworthy federated causal inference in distributed
healthcare systems.

Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative
tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models
often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific
applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing
methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D
GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling
the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this,
we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs,
which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node
within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the
localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural
interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the
spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining
the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances
interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies
typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.

Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)
via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations
(FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by
a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We
show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with
arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network
approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process.
We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training
DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis
emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the
role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in
addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work
bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights
into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平坦模式在组合优化和离散生成建模中有广泛应用，但现有采样算法难以有效捕捉平坦模式。

Method: 通过引入局部熵和连续辅助变量，提出EDLP方法，指导离散采样器朝向平坦模式。

Result: EDLP在局部对数凹离散分布中具有非渐近收敛保证，并在多个任务中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: EDLP是一种高效且理论支持的平坦模式采样方法，适用于多种离散空间任务。

Abstract: Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored
problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in
combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing
sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat
modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic
Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the
sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint
distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat
modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees
for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method
consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require
sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted
Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机交互框架，动态更新评分函数和阈值以应对分布外输入，同时严格控制假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在部署时可能遇到分布外输入，现有方法仅基于分布内数据设置阈值，导致假阳性率高且缺乏适应性。

Method: 采用人机交互框架，实时更新评分函数和阈值，最大化真阳性率并严格控制假阳性率。

Result: 在OpenOOD基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现更高的真阳性率并保持假阳性率控制。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分布外输入的不确定性量化问题，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but
often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing
serious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on
designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds
typically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate
(TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based
thresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in
high FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring
functions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed,
evolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these
challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \emph{safely updates
both scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD
inputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times,
even as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR
control under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations
on OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经算子（NOs）与Krylov子空间数值方法的框架，用于高效分析大规模动力系统的稳定性和分岔行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子（NOs）在物理定律计算中表现出强大潜力，但其在系统级任务（如固定点、稳定性和分岔分析）中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将局部NOs与Krylov子空间迭代数值方法结合，实现对大规模动力系统的稳定性和分岔分析。同时展示了局部空间和时空NOs在加速时空动力学分析中的作用。

Result: 通过三个非线性PDE基准测试（Allen-Cahn方程、Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE和FitzHugh-Nagumo模型）验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统级稳定性和分岔分析提供了高效工具，扩展了NOs在复杂动力学系统中的应用范围。

Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations
involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential
equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function
spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their
subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to
explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal
simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical
system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis -
crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena -
remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free
multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates
(local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace,
so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of
large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation
analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of
local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the
computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework
via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes
multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE,
which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN)
model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node
bifurcations.

TL;DR: GVM-RAFT是一种针对CoT推理的动态样本分配策略，通过优化计算资源分配，显著提升训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT训练方法（如RAFT）采用静态采样策略，导致梯度估计效率低下，无法适应不同提示的难度变化。

Method: 提出GVM-RAFT，动态分配计算资源，监控提示接受率和梯度范数以最小化梯度方差。

Result: 实验显示GVM-RAFT在数学推理任务上比RAFT快2-4倍，且准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: GVM-RAFT是一种通用策略，可应用于其他强化学习算法，提升收敛速度和测试准确性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be
formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate
intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative
reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they
typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to
account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work
identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic
gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a
prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize
stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The
method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt
acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting
gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees
under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that
GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over
vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be
incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO,
leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过控制训练范数（$l^p$）来缓解对抗训练中Catastrophic Overfitting（CO）问题的新方法，无需依赖噪声注入或正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法（如FGSM）在$l^{\infty}$范数下易发生CO，而$l^2$范数下较少出现。作者希望通过研究梯度集中性与范数的关系，找到缓解CO的新途径。

Method: 通过将广义$l^p$攻击建模为固定点问题，开发了$l^p$-FGSM攻击，并利用梯度集中性（通过Participation Ratio和熵量化）自适应调整训练范数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不依赖额外正则化或噪声注入的情况下，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过控制训练范数和量化梯度集中性，论文提供了一种理论支撑的新方法，有效缓解了对抗训练中的CO问题。

Abstract: Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast
methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from
Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step
attacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on
noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel
solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.
  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent
under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we
develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and
craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to
$l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly
concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact
with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through
Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM
that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness
without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a
novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.

Conclusion: Bielik v3为波兰语高效建模设定了新标准，推动了资源受限场景下的高质量语言AI应用。

Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text
models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models
demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance
comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer
computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a
custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency,
Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction
types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training
progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens
spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks,
including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding
Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter
model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the
1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile.
These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language
modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI
more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZSharp是SAM的改进方法，通过层间Z-score归一化和百分位过滤选择显著梯度方向，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易收敛到尖锐最小值，影响鲁棒性。SAM虽寻求平坦最小值，但使用全梯度扰动可能包含不显著方向。

Method: ZSharp结合层间Z-score归一化和百分位过滤，仅保留显著梯度方向，优化更新方向。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上，ZSharp在测试准确率上优于SAM及其变体，尤其在深层和Transformer模型中表现突出。

Conclusion: ZSharp是一种轻量且有效的改进方法，无需架构调整即可提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge,
particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade
robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking
flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can
include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet
effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization
followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant
gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with
curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring
architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter,
the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM
variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet,
VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and
its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based
models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight
improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

Motivation: 现有方法在化学反应和逆合成预测中面临数据不足和任务关联性被忽视的问题，ChemDual旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: ChemDual将反应和逆合成视为重组和碎片化过程，构建了440万条指令数据集，并采用多尺度分词器和双任务学习策略优化LLaMA模型。

Result: 在Mol-Instruction和USPTO-50K数据集上，ChemDual在反应和逆合成预测中表现优于现有单任务方法和开源LLM。

Conclusion: ChemDual在药物设计中展现出强大潜力，生成具有多样性和高蛋白结合亲和力的化合物。

Abstract: Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug
discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many
domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major
challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction
dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and
retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address
these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate
chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition
for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the
reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related
recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4
million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced
LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy,
to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as
the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments
on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and
retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches
and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual
generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further
highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在边缘设备上的部署受到存储和计算需求的限制。

Method: 采用层间混合量化方案（对称和非对称量化）和Huffman编码进行无损压缩，并引入并行Huffman解码以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在边缘兼容的LLMs上，EntroLLM实现了高达30%的存储减少（相比uint8）和65%的存储减少（相比uint4），同时保持语言任务的困惑度和准确性。推理吞吐量提高了31.9%至146.6%。

Conclusion: EntroLLM无需重新训练，与现有后训练量化方法兼容，是边缘设备上LLMs的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across
various tasks, but their large storage and computational requirements constrain
their deployment on edge devices. To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel
compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to
reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a
layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and
asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to
optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless
compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth
requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which
enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring
minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including
smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct,
demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30%$ storage reduction compared to
uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while
preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further
show that our method enables $31.9%$ - $146.6%$ faster inference throughput on
memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing
the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional
re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization
methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.

Motivation: 探索差分隐私随机赌博问题中Thompson Sampling与高斯先验、高斯机制及高斯差分隐私之间的深层联系。

Method: 提出DP-TS-UCB算法，结合高斯分布的反集中界限，平衡隐私与遗憾。

Result: DP-TS-UCB满足$\tilde{O}(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)})$-GDP，遗憾界为$O(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta)$。

Conclusion: 该算法在隐私与性能之间提供了灵活权衡，其理论分析对Thompson Sampling和UCB算法的探索机制有独立意义。

Abstract: We address differentially private stochastic bandit problems from the angles
of exploring the deep connections among Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors,
Gaussian mechanisms, and Gaussian differential privacy (GDP). We propose
DP-TS-UCB, a novel parametrized private bandit algorithm that enables to trade
off privacy and regret. DP-TS-UCB satisfies $ \tilde{O}
\left(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)}\right)$-GDP and enjoys an $O
\left(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta \right)$ regret bound, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$
controls the trade-off between privacy and regret. Theoretically, our DP-TS-UCB
relies on anti-concentration bounds of Gaussian distributions and links
exploration mechanisms in Thompson Sampling-based algorithms and Upper
Confidence Bound-based algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

Motivation: 由于官方服务繁忙和数据隐私问题，本地部署DeepSeek-R1和V3的需求增加，但模型参数过大导致单机部署困难。量化技术虽能减少内存占用，但其对模型性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 对DeepSeek模型进行多比特宽度化评估，并提出动态3位量化方法DQ3_K_M，与传统Q3_K_M和4位量化方法Q4_K_M进行对比。

Result: 4位量化性能损失极小，支持单机部署；DQ3_K_M在多项基准测试中优于传统3位量化方法，且与4位量化性能接近，同时支持多种硬件配置。

Conclusion: DQ3_K_M是一种高效的3位量化方法，适用于本地部署，性能接近4位量化，且支持多种硬件平台。

Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally,
possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some
organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment
offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration
exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization
is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However,
it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being
quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of
multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key
findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance
degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard
NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization
method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various
benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach
in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment
configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of
DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing
optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the
Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need
several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how
popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes
Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also
be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those
distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for
other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.

Motivation: 解决文本到时间序列生成中的数据稀疏性、不平衡性以及多模态数据集有限的问题，同时克服现有方法在通用性和长度适应性上的局限性。

Method: 提出T2S框架，采用长度自适应的变分自编码器将不同长度的时间序列编码为一致的潜在嵌入，并结合Flow Matching和Diffusion Transformer实现文本与时间序列的对齐。

Result: 在12个领域的13个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T2S框架在文本到时间序列生成中表现出色，具有通用性和长度适应性，为多领域应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address
challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of
multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have
achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data)
generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages.
Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic
exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often
domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to
generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to
real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions
into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level.
Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000
high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series
(T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural
language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a
length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying
lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively
aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow
Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in
an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate
sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S
achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

Abstract: One-shot FL enables collaborative training in a single round, eliminating the
need for iterative communication, making it particularly suitable for use in
resource-constrained and privacy-sensitive applications. This survey offers a
thorough examination of One-shot FL, highlighting its distinct operational
framework compared to traditional federated approaches. One-shot FL supports
resource-limited devices by enabling single-round model aggregation while
maintaining data locality. The survey systematically categorizes existing
methodologies, emphasizing advancements in client model initialization,
aggregation techniques, and strategies for managing heterogeneous data
distributions. Furthermore, we analyze the limitations of current approaches,
particularly in terms of scalability and generalization in non-IID settings. By
analyzing cutting-edge techniques and outlining open challenges, this survey
aspires to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners
aiming to design and implement One-shot FL systems, advancing the development
and adoption of One-shot FL solutions in a real-world, resource-constrained

### [194] [FairPO: Robust Preference Optimization for Fair Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02433)
*Soumen Kumar Mondal,Akshit Varmora,Prateek Chanda,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairPO是一个新颖的框架，旨在通过直接优化偏好信号来提升多标签分类中的公平性，采用群体鲁棒性视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多标签分类中的公平性问题，特别是针对特权和非特权标签组的偏见问题。

Method: 将标签分为特权和非特权组，采用基于偏好的损失函数（受DPO启发），并通过鲁棒优化动态调整训练重点。

Result: 框架能够有效区分特权组中的真实正标签与混淆负标签，同时保持非特权标签的分类性能。

Conclusion: FairPO通过动态调整训练重点减少偏见，未来计划扩展损失函数和多标签生成能力。

Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in
multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a
group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is
partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based
loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more
effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within
the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for
non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization
over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward
groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer
treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to
extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as
Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training
signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation
capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent
label sets for ambiguous inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于回溯反事实的高效方法，结合因果推理生成可操作的解释，解决了传统方法忽略因果关系和新方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实解释方法常忽略因果关系，导致不现实的例子；而结合因果关系的新方法计算成本高，因此需要一种高效且能结合因果推理的方法。

Method: 提出基于回溯反事实的方法，结合因果推理生成解释，并分析其与现有技术的关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能更深入地理解模型输出，并在特定场景下泛化现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且结合因果推理，为模型解释提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying
alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights
into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal
relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches
integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these
challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking
counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable
explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then
introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship
between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes
them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides
deeper insights into model outputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于二元神经网络（BNN）的持续学习（CL）方法，用于资源受限设备中的关键词识别（KWS），能够高效地集成新关键词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备中的KWS模型通常是静态的，无法适应新场景（如新增关键词），因此需要一种高效且计算成本低的持续学习方法。

Method: 采用二元神经网络（BNN）结合持续学习技术，评估了七种CL方法在16类用例中的表现。

Result: 单次新增关键词的准确率超过95%，四次新增的准确率达86%。批处理算法对CL数据集大小更敏感，计算复杂度差异不显著。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在资源受限设备中高效持续集成新关键词的潜力。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an essential function that enables interaction with
ubiquitous smart devices. However, in resource-limited devices, KWS models are
often static and can thus not adapt to new scenarios, such as added keywords.
To overcome this problem, we propose a Continual Learning (CL) approach for KWS
built on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). The framework leverages the reduced
computation and memory requirements of BNNs while incorporating techniques that
enable the seamless integration of new keywords over time. This study evaluates
seven CL techniques on a 16-class use case, reporting an accuracy exceeding 95%
for a single additional keyword and up to 86% for four additional classes.
Sensitivity to the amount of training samples in the CL phase, and differences
in computational complexities are being evaluated. These evaluations
demonstrate that batch-based algorithms are more sensitive to the CL dataset
size, and that differences between the computational complexities are
insignificant. These findings highlight the potential of developing an
effective and computationally efficient technique for continuously integrating
new keywords in KWS applications that is compatible with resource-constrained
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在持续学习中的遗忘问题，尤其是表面和本质遗忘。

Method: 1. 提出Answer Style Diversification (ASD)解决表面遗忘；2. 提出RegLoRA通过正则化关键参数解决本质遗忘。

Result: 整体方法SEFE在实验中表现最优。

Conclusion: ASD和RegLoRA有效解决了持续学习中的遗忘问题，SEFE方法达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context,
categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting.
Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be
genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected
formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the
results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where
the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers,
indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting
necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial
forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce
the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized
process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their
training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial
forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to
mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior
knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to
retain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall
method, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯推断的自适应方法，用于在联邦学习中鲁棒地聚合模型更新，无需知道被攻击客户端的数量，且在多种攻击类型下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分散数据上协作训练模型，但易受对抗攻击，且攻击客户端的数量和程度可能未知或变化。

Method: 通过贝叶斯推断定义均值更新，最大化边际似然概率，独立于被攻击客户端的数量。

Result: 在三种图像分类数据集上，该方法在静态和动态恶意客户端攻击下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简单且高效，适用于联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
on decentralized data. This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world
scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with
the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these
challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model
updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum
of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be
`honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical
average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent
of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective
against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as
Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated
setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types
with static and varying number of malicious clients.

TL;DR: 研究比较了三种深度学习天气预测模型（FourCastNet、SFNO、ClimaX）的长期稳定性，发现SFNO在超参数选择上最稳健，但所有模型都可能因随机种子和变量选择而出现不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在中短期天气预测中表现优异，但在长期预测中物理一致性不足，而传统大气模型却能稳定运行数十年。本研究旨在探索深度学习模型长期稳定性的关键设计因素。

Method: 使用ERA5再分析数据训练三种模型（FourCastNet、SFNO、ClimaX），系统评估自回归训练步数、模型容量和预测变量选择对长期稳定性的影响。

Result: SFNO在超参数选择上表现最稳健，但所有模型都可能因随机种子和变量选择而出现不稳定。某些配置能实现稳定的10年预测，同时保持数据统计特性。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型可通过特定配置实现长期稳定性，但稳定性仍受随机因素和变量选择影响，SFNO在稳健性上表现最佳。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
medium-range weather prediction but often fail to maintain physically
consistent rollouts beyond 14 days. In contrast, a few atmospheric models
demonstrate stability over decades, though the key design choices enabling this
remain unclear. This study quantitatively compares the long-term stability of
three prominent DL-MWP architectures - FourCastNet, SFNO, and ClimaX - trained
on ERA5 reanalysis data at 5.625{\deg} resolution. We systematically assess the
impact of autoregressive training steps, model capacity, and choice of
prognostic variables, identifying configurations that enable stable 10-year
rollouts while preserving the statistical properties of the reference dataset.
Notably, rollouts with SFNO exhibit the greatest robustness to hyperparameter
choices, yet all models can experience instability depending on the random seed
and the set of prognostic variables

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉药代动力学数据中的复杂非线性关系，因此需要一种更高效、数据驱动的方法来识别关键协变量。

Method: 结合VAE和LASSO回归，VAE用于压缩高维药代动力学信号，LASSO回归用于稀疏特征选择。

Result: 该方法成功识别出与他克莫司相关的关键协变量（如SNP、年龄、白蛋白和血红蛋白），并有效排除无关特征，重建误差低至2.26%。

Conclusion: VAE-LASSO方法为协变量选择提供了一种可扩展、可解释的数据驱动解决方案，适用于药物开发和精准药物治疗。

Abstract: Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling is a fundamental tool for
understanding drug behaviour across diverse patient populations and enabling
personalized dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. A key challenge
in PopPK analysis lies in identifying and modelling covariates that influence
drug absorption, as these relationships are often complex and nonlinear.
Traditional methods may fail to capture hidden patterns within the data. In
this study, we propose a data-driven, model-free framework that integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) deep learning model and LASSO regression to
uncover key covariates from simulated tacrolimus pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles.
The VAE compresses high-dimensional PK signals into a structured latent space,
achieving accurate reconstruction with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
of 2.26%. LASSO regression is then applied to map patient-specific covariates
to the latent space, enabling sparse feature selection through L1
regularization. This approach consistently identifies clinically relevant
covariates for tacrolimus including SNP, age, albumin, and hemoglobin which are
retained across the tested regularization strength levels, while effectively
discarding non-informative features. The proposed VAE-LASSO methodology offers
a scalable, interpretable, and fully data-driven solution for covariate
selection, with promising applications in drug development and precision
pharmacotherapy.

Motivation: 传统方法忽视源领域特征，FedSDAF填补了这一空白，特别针对联邦设置中的数据隔离问题。

Method: FedSDAF包含两个组件：领域不变适配器（保留不变特征）和领域感知适配器（利用多头自注意力提取源领域特征），并引入双向知识蒸馏机制。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中，FedSDAF优于现有方法，准确率提升5.2-13.8%。

Conclusion: FedSDAF首次系统利用源领域特征，显著提升了联邦领域泛化的性能。

Abstract: Traditional domain generalization approaches predominantly focus on
leveraging target domain-aware features while overlooking the critical role of
source domain-specific characteristics, particularly in federated settings with
inherent data isolation. To address this gap, we propose the Federated Source
Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first method to systematically
exploit source domain-aware features for enhanced federated domain
generalization (FedDG). The FedSDAF framework consists of two synergistic
components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter, which preserves critical
domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Aware Adapter, which extracts and
integrates source domain-specific knowledge using a Multihead Self-Attention
mechanism (MHSA). Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional knowledge
distillation mechanism that fosters knowledge sharing among clients while
safeguarding privacy. Our approach represents the first systematic exploitation
of source domain-aware features, resulting in significant advancements in model
generalization capability.Extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks
(OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, and DomainNet) show that our method consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art federated domain generalization approaches, with
accuracy gains of 5.2-13.8%. The source code is available at

Result: 实验证明新方法在性能和训练稳定性上优于传统单调架构。

Conclusion: 本文为单调MLP提供了理论基础，并通过新方法简化了架构并优化了训练效果。

Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction
involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation
functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we
generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative
weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are
universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an
equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the
weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex
monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as
universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained
counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical
effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible
architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization
difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to
adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates
the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and
improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity
of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably
to traditional monotonic architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化联邦学习框架pFedLIA，通过高效的影响近似方法（Lazy Influence）对客户端进行分布式聚类，以解决数据分布异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据分布异构性导致单一全局模型无法满足个体需求，例如键盘输入预测、医疗图像或驾驶数据。

Method: 提出pFedLIA框架，利用Lazy Influence方法对客户端进行分布式聚类，每个集群内联合训练模型以捕捉特定数据模式。

Result: 在多种合成和真实场景（如北欧语言输入预测和CIFAR100任务）中，成功恢复全局模型性能，性能提升17%。

Conclusion: pFedLIA框架有效解决了数据异构性问题，性能接近理想聚类结果，显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: In Federated Learning, heterogeneity in client data distributions often means
that a single global model does not have the best performance for individual
clients. Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for
keyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age,
etc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID
dataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different
machines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we
propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework
(pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation,
called `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before
model aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly
train a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our
method has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance
drop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings,
specifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as
several benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle
clustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an
improvement of 17% on CIFAR100.

Conclusion: 该基准为开发兼具鲁棒性和可解释性的GNNs奠定了基础，有助于在敏感应用中建立信任。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in graph-based data
analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social
networks, and recommendation systems. However, the interplay between model
interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under
adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a
comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors
on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of
robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.
  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across
five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability
metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how
defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model
training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between
robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open
source.
  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on
the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By
establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for
developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable,
facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.

Result: 在六个公开数据集上的实验表明，FedGM优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGM为联邦图学习提供了一种高效、隐私安全的新范式。

Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes
collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client
graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model
parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately
address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph
distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among
the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication,
they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead.
To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a
novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new
FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation
graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs,
while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single
transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public
datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL
paradigm.

Abstract: The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of
time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized
methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm
for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual
data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time
series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not
inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to
address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of
LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first
introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based
on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then
summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and
discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we
conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains
to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality
strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several
promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range
of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time
series modeling.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了参数空间中低损失区域的连通性，为过参数化理论提供新视角，并提出了改进模型泛化的新方法。

Abstract: Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima
are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate
that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of
intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new
algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not
only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact
Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence
of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the
low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter
space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network
over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a
high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only
within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space.
Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and
opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space
that is closer to the origin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多问题涉及约束域，但现有平均场算法因全局扩散项无法解决此类问题，因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: 通过将平均场朗之万动力学（MFLD）扩展到镜像朗之万框架，提出了MMFLD方法。

Result: 通过均匀对数-Sobolev不等式，证明了连续MMFLD的线性收敛性，并对其时间和粒子离散化版本给出了均匀传播混沌结果。

Conclusion: MMFLD为约束域问题提供了一种有效的优化方法，并具有理论保证。

Abstract: The mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized
nonlinear convex functional on the Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^d$, and
has gained attention recently as a model for the gradient descent dynamics of
interacting particle systems such as infinite-width two-layer neural networks.
However, many problems of interest have constrained domains, which are not
solved by existing mean-field algorithms due to the global diffusion term. We
study the optimization of probability measures constrained to a convex subset
of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by proposing the \emph{mirror mean-field Langevin dynamics}
(MMFLD), an extension of MFLD to the mirror Langevin framework. We obtain
linear convergence guarantees for the continuous MMFLD via a uniform
log-Sobolev inequality, and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos results for

Conclusion: 本研究为神经网络组合泛化的基础理论提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial property in artificial
intelligence, enabling models to handle novel combinations of known components.
While most deep learning models lack this capability, certain models succeed in
specific tasks, suggesting the existence of governing conditions. This paper
derives a necessary and sufficient condition for compositional generalization
in neural networks. Conceptually, it requires that (i) the computational graph
matches the true compositional structure, and (ii) components encode just
enough information in training. The condition is supported by mathematical
proofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization,
and training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates
an intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of
the condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This
work is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in
neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迁移学习的多目标深度强化学习方法，用于优化翼型的几何形状，同时考虑气动和结构性能。实验表明，该方法在计算效率和优化性能上优于粒子群优化，且迁移学习进一步节省了计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化翼型设计时需同时考虑气动（升阻比）和结构（最大厚度）性能，传统方法效率较低。本文旨在通过深度强化学习和迁移学习提升优化效率和性能。

Method: 采用多目标深度强化学习（DRL）方法，结合迁移学习策略，优化翼型几何形状。与粒子群优化（PSO）进行对比。

Result: DRL方法在计算效率和优化性能上优于PSO，迁移学习进一步提升了计算资源利用率。

Conclusion: 迁移学习增强的DRL方法在多目标翼型优化中表现优异，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer
learning-enhanced, multi-objective, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on
concomitant aerodynamic and structural criteria. To showcase the method, we aim
to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural
integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train
the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The
performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation
(PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that
DRL agents are able to perform multi-objective shape optimisation, that the DRL
approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and shape
optimisation performance, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves
performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial
computational resources.

Method: 引入衰减违规预算的预算多臂老虎机框架，提出预算UCB算法，平衡性能与约束合规。

Result: 理论证明预算UCB具有次线性遗憾和对数级约束违规，仿真显示其优于标准在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建自适应、资源感知的IoT系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where
devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource
constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall
short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit
framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our
model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint
violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter
compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance
with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that
Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations
over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication
setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint
satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the
framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: The Transformer model has shown strong performance in multivariate time
series forecasting by leveraging channel-wise self-attention. However, this
approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does
not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these
limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative
Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all
linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well
as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer
employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with
cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate
information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive
experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer
significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness
in enhancing time series forecasting. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into
another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its
therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming
strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time
commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex
biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway
networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under
the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To
facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a
pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of
pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve
the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we
incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial
neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL
agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from
literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Addressing the computational challenges inherent in training large-scale deep
neural networks remains a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning
research. While previous efforts have focused on enhancing training efficiency
through techniques such as gradient descent with momentum, learning rate
scheduling, and weight regularization, the demand for further innovation
continues to burgeon as model sizes keep expanding. In this study, we introduce
a novel framework which diverges from conventional approaches by leveraging
long-term time series forecasting techniques. Our method capitalizes solely on
initial and final weight values, offering a streamlined alternative for complex
model architectures. We also introduce a novel regularizer that is tailored to
enhance the forecasting performance of our approach. Empirical evaluations
conducted on synthetic weight sequences and real-world deep learning
architectures, including the prominent large language model DistilBERT,
demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of forecasting accuracy and
computational efficiency. Notably, our framework showcases improved performance
while requiring minimal additional computational overhead, thus presenting a
promising avenue for accelerating the training process across diverse tasks and
architectures.

Motivation: LLMs在零样本或少样本任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉和知识过时或缺失的问题，而重新训练成本高昂。知识图谱作为结构化外部知识源，可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 利用知识图谱的实体类别层次表示逐步剪枝候选空间，并通过实体描述丰富输入提示，增强LLMs的零样本实体消歧能力。

Result: 在流行的ED数据集上，该方法优于未增强和仅描述增强的LLMs，且比任务特定模型更具适应性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的语义表达能力对ED性能有显著影响，该方法为LLMs的知识增强提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a
prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can
approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the
need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some
challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or
missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems
cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a
time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge
Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information
to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for
zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the
hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune
the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input
prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets
shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only
enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific
models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the
leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合方差网络与贝叶斯神经网络的协同训练方法，有效分离偶然性和认知性不确定性，并提升均值估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据中存在偶然性不确定性（不可约噪声），而现有方法（如MVE网络和贝叶斯神经网络）各有局限，无法同时处理两种不确定性。

Method: 协同训练一个方差网络与贝叶斯神经网络，分离偶然性和认知性不确定性，并优化均值估计。

Result: 在多种数据集（包括一个已知偶然性不确定性的时间依赖性异方差回归数据集）上验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法易于实现、鲁棒性强，且适用于多种模型架构。

Abstract: Real-world data contains aleatoric uncertainty - irreducible noise arising
from imperfect measurements or from incomplete knowledge about the data
generation process. Mean variance estimation (MVE) networks can learn this type
of uncertainty but require ad-hoc regularization strategies to avoid
overfitting and are unable to predict epistemic uncertainty (model
uncertainty). Conversely, Bayesian neural networks predict epistemic
uncertainty but are notoriously difficult to train due to the approximate
nature of Bayesian inference. We propose to cooperatively train a variance
network with a Bayesian neural network and demonstrate that the resulting model
disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while improving the mean
estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this method
across a diverse range of datasets, including a time-dependent heteroscedastic
regression dataset we created where the aleatoric uncertainty is known. The
proposed method is straightforward to implement, robust, and adaptable to
various model architectures.

Result: 实验表明，HSplitLoRA在训练准确性和收敛速度上优于现有基准。

Conclusion: HSplitLoRA为异构设备上的大语言模型微调提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and
beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private
data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated
learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing
raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in
real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous
computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these
challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on
heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights
based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures
the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines
the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices.
Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support
heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks
in training accuracy and convergence speed.

Motivation: 理解神经网络Hessian矩阵近块对角结构的理论基础，尤其是类别数$C$对其的影响。

Method: 通过随机矩阵理论分析线性模型和单隐藏层网络在MSE和CE损失下的Hessian矩阵块对角结构。

Result: 研究发现，随着类别数$C$趋近于无穷大，Hessian矩阵呈现块对角结构，$C$是主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 类别数$C$是Hessian矩阵近块对角结构的关键因素，这对理解大语言模型（LLMs）的Hessian结构具有启示意义。

Abstract: Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs)
exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation
remains unclear. In this work, we reveal two forces that shape the Hessian
structure: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a
``dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis of ``static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models
and 1-hidden-layer networks with the mean-square (MSE) loss and the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks. By leveraging random matrix
theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal
Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C
\rightarrow \infty$, where $C$ denotes the number of classes. Our findings
reveal that $C$ is a primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These
results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models
(LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$ or $10^5$.

Conclusion: 该框架完全数据驱动，适用于广泛的时变模拟问题，代码已开源并即将集成到ModelFLOWs-app中。

Abstract: This work presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first
generalizable and fully data-driven adaptive framework designed to stabilize
deep learning (DL) autoregressive forecasting models over long time horizons,
with the goal of reducing the computational cost required in computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.The proposed methodology alternates between
two phases: (i) predicting the evolution of the flow field over a selected time
interval using a trained DL model, and (ii) updating the model with newly
generated CFD data when stability degrades, thus maintaining accurate long-term
forecasting. This adaptive retraining strategy ensures robustness while
avoiding the accumulation of predictive errors typical in autoregressive
models. The framework is validated across three increasingly complex flow
regimes, from laminar to turbulent, demonstrating from 30 \% to 95 \% reduction
in computational cost without compromising physical consistency or accuracy.
Its entirely data-driven nature makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of
time-dependent simulation problems. The code implementing this methodology is
available as open-source and it will be integrated into the upcoming release of
the ModelFLOWs-app.

Result: 模拟结果显示HSP可以解释神经元元可塑性、生物回路的灵活性，并表明梯度学习可以从简单的进化动力学中快速涌现。

Conclusion: HSP可能是主要的记忆和学习机制，而Hebbian可塑性是其副产品；这一发现为AI训练算法和硬件设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological
brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via
heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of
gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of
biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine
learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This
principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and
heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics,
thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative
perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning
and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations
that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can
explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can
arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any
explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also
implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically
learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to
the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in
nature.

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of
machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep
learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become
increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high
predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent
work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of
topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its
chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification
scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple
heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical
composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating
chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table.
For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks,
we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with
and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training
set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive
bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of
test accuracy.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing
high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in
continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color
channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities
such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed
by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their
applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose
Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time,
discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete
spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse
diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation,
we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We
demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis,
class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks,
with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight
its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials
microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned
scientific applications.

Abstract: Point cloud surface representation is a fundamental problem in computer
graphics and vision. This paper presents a machine learning approach for
approximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse
ellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate
surface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points
constructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately
with as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e.,
represent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and
approximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is
introduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly
optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve
computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,
restricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.
The computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which
significantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical
octree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the
initialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using
coarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice
points are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and
enhance training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous sparse representation
approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The
corresponding code is publicly available at

### [225] [Faster logconcave sampling from a cold start in high dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01937)
*Yunbum Kook,Santosh S. Vempala*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种更快的算法，用于生成对数凹密度的预热启动，首次实现了近各向同性输入下的亚立方采样算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作在维度上至少需要线性预热启动惩罚，甚至对于凸体的均匀采样也达到了立方障碍，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过两种关键技术改进：(1) 在较弱的距离概念（如q-Rényi散度）下采样；(2) 推广了Lee和Vempala的对数Sobolev不等式。

Result: 首次实现了亚立方采样算法，突破了预热启动的立方障碍。

Conclusion: 该研究在预热启动和对数凹采样领域取得了显著进展，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a faster algorithm to generate a warm start for sampling an
arbitrary logconcave density specified by an evaluation oracle, leading to the
first sub-cubic sampling algorithms for inputs in (near-)isotropic position. A
long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the
dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform
sampling from convex bodies.
  Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We
show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in
particular $q$-R\'enyi divergence for $q=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, whereas
previous analyses required stringent $\infty$-R\'enyi divergence (with the
exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the
first improvement in the required warmness since Lov\'asz and Simonovits
(1991). (2) We refine and generalize the log-Sobolev inequality of Lee and
Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions
in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms
of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of
the covariance matrix.

### [226] [CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476)
*Zhe Zhang,Mingxiu Cai,Hanxiao Wang,Gaochang Wu,Tianyou Chai,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CostFilter-AD的方法，通过引入成本过滤概念改进无监督异常检测（UAD）中的匹配过程，提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UAD方法依赖图像或特征级匹配，但匹配过程不准确且被忽视，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 构建匹配成本体积，提出成本体积过滤网络，利用输入观察作为注意力查询，抑制噪声并保留边缘结构。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA基准测试中验证了CostFilter-AD对单类和多类UAD任务的通用性优势。

Conclusion: CostFilter-AD作为一种通用后处理插件，可显著提升现有UAD方法的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an
input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal
counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding
space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level
or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching
process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To
address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from
classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD
problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first
construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples,
comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes
potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network,
guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature
layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge
structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic
post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either
reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on
MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for
both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

*Michael Marinaccio,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM-TIFF是一种基于RGB输入的师生蒸馏框架，用于火灾温度预测和分割，无需热传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态传感（如RGB和热成像）增加了硬件成本和功耗，因此需要一种仅依赖RGB输入的方法来实现高保真火灾监测。

Method: 通过多模态教师网络（RGB-热成像配对数据）向单模态RGB学生网络蒸馏知识，结合SAM引导的掩码生成、TOPSIS选择、Canny边缘检测和Otsu阈值处理，实现自动点提示选择和分割监督。

Result: 首次实现了基于RGB无人机数据的像素级温度回归，并在FLAME 3数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻量级、低成本的无人机火灾监测系统奠定了基础，无需热传感器。

Abstract: High-fidelity wildfire monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
typically requires multimodal sensing - especially RGB and thermal imagery -
which increases hardware cost and power consumption. This paper introduces
SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level
wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A
multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and
radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student
network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is
generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask
generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and
Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method
is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data,
demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work
lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire
monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出SLM-SAM 2方法，通过结合短期和长期记忆模块改进SAM 2在医学图像分割中的性能，显著减少错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像手动标注耗时耗力，现有SAM 2模型在跨切片传播标注时存在边界错误传播问题。

Method: 提出SLM-SAM 2，整合短期和长期记忆模块及独立注意力机制，提升分割精度。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，SLM-SAM 2平均Dice系数提升0.14（5卷初始适应）和0.11（1卷初始适应）。

Conclusion: SLM-SAM 2显著提升医学图像自动标注的准确性，减少过传播问题。

Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and
time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video
object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a
potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by
manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks
across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context
varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention
module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where
the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To
address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel
architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks
with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate
SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across
MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms
the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of
0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for
the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger
resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate
automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文研究了SAR图像中内陆水体分割任务，模拟了人工标注中的对抗攻击，评估了U-Net模型对标注错误的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的水体分割对洪水测绘等应用至关重要，但复杂几何形状和人工标注噪声增加了挑战。

Method: 通过模拟对抗攻击生成人工标注错误，测试U-Net模型在噪声标注下的性能。

Result: U-Net模型在一定程度的标注噪声下仍能保持性能，但噪声过高时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 人工标注质量对分割模型效果至关重要，公开了代码、数据集及对抗样本以支持鲁棒训练。

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is
an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While
SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images,
differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not
straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex
geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used
deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice,
manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as
ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to
data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we
simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model
and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our
results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before
its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role
that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness
of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial
examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link -

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于fMRI的视觉图像重建新方法，利用主体无关的通用表示空间，显著提高了低数据场景下的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在主体间脑信号对齐和低数据场景下效率不足，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过训练将主体脑信号对齐到通用空间，形成语义对齐的通用脑，并利用轻量级模块对齐参考主体。

Result: 方法在不同数据集上表现优异，通用空间具有主体和数据集无关性。

Conclusion: 该方法在低数据场景下高效且通用，优于传统端到端训练方法。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image
reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show
that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space
during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged
to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a
reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end
training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our
methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject
and dataset-agnostic.

### [231] [Easz: An Agile Transformer-based Image Compression Framework for Resource-constrained IoTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01742)
*Yu Mao,Jingzong Li,Jun Wang,Hong Xu,Tei-Wei Kuo,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的边缘计算无关图像压缩框架Easz，通过将计算负担转移到服务器端，解决了神经网络图像压缩在边缘设备上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络图像压缩在边缘设备上应用时面临编码-解码结构复杂和压缩级别切换不灵活的问题，限制了其在实际场景中的使用。

Method: Easz采用基于Transformer的框架，利用patch-erase算法选择性移除图像内容，并通过轻量级Transformer结构在接收端重建图像。

Result: 实验表明，Easz在压缩级别适应性、计算效率和图像重建质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Easz为边缘设备上的图像压缩提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine
communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and
inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently,
it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to
edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational
and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a
new transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz.
Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the
heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a
patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional
uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side
through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational
overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based
reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver
side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a real-world testbed demonstrate
multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of
adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and
image reconstruction quality.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: YODA是一种基于扩散模型的2.5D框架，用于医学图像翻译，结合扩散和回归范式生成高质量图像，并通过ExpA采样抑制噪声。实验表明其优于现有GAN和DM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像翻译需要高精度的解剖信息，而现有GAN和DM方法可能因噪声或内容幻觉影响临床实用性。

Method: 提出YODA框架，结合扩散和回归范式，并引入ExpA采样技术抑制噪声。

Result: YODA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成图像可与真实采集图像媲美或更优。

Conclusion: YODA挑战了DM在医学图像翻译中的优势，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is
crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance
and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired
data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have
achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits -
creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical
applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact,
the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical
utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel
2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and
regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore,
we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws
inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise
and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality.
Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising
multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and
regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the
computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic
benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we
demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods.
Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even
superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings
challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the
practical application of MIT in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用CNN（MobileNetV2和ResNet101V2）诊断肺炎，结果显示MobileNetV2更稳定，而Scratch模型虽准确率高但易过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺炎诊断常因不典型表现、胸片限制和共存呼吸道疾病而存在不确定性，需更可靠方法。

Method: 采用MobileNetV2预训练模型和ResNet101V2架构，以及Keras API构建的Scratch模型，通过Kaggle数据集进行训练。

Result: MobileNetV2表现稳定（训练准确率84.87%），Scratch模型准确率高但过拟合（验证损失增至1.1809）。

Conclusion: MobileNetV2适合稳定性需求，Scratch模型适合高精度场景，需权衡选择。

Abstract: Pneumonia Diagnosis, though it is crucial for an effective treatment, it can
be hampered by uncertainty. This uncertainty starts to arise due to some
factors like atypical presentations, limitations of diagnostic tools such as
chest X-rays, and the presence of co-existing respiratory conditions. This
research proposes one of the supervised learning methods, CNN. Using
MobileNetV2 as the pre-trained one with ResNet101V2 architecture and using
Keras API as the built from scratch model, for identifying lung diseases
especially pneumonia. The datasets used in this research were obtained from the
website through Kaggle. The result shows that by implementing CNN MobileNetV2
and CNN from scratch the result is promising. While validating data,
MobileNetV2 performs with stability and minimal overfitting, while the training
accuracy increased to 84.87% later it slightly decreased to 78.95%, with
increasing validation loss from 0.499 to 0.6345. Nonetheless, MobileNetV2 is
more stable. Although it takes more time to train each epoch. Meanwhile, after
the 10th epoch, the Scratch model displayed more instability and overfitting
despite having higher validation accuracy, training accuracy decreased
significantly to 78.12% and the validation loss increased from 0.5698 to
1.1809. With these results, ResNet101V2 offers stability, and the Scratch model
offers high accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用深度学习从过去的高场MRI扫描中提取个性化特征的方法，以提升低成本低场MRI的图像质量和扫描速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高场MRI成本高，低场MRI虽然成本低但图像质量差且扫描时间长，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出ViT-Fuser，一种特征融合视觉变换器，利用过去的高场MRI扫描特征来增强低场MRI的图像质量。

Result: 实验表明，ViT-Fuser在多个数据集上优于现有方法，显著提升了低场MRI的图像质量，且对分布外数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本、高质量的MRI成像提供了可行方案，具有广泛的医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superb-quality images, but its
accessibility is limited by high costs, posing challenges for patients
requiring longitudinal care. Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with
low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality,
including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a
novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features
from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable
accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To
overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a
feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g.
those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is
sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths,
and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma
data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that
ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality
images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution
data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality,
low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为智能交通系统提供了一种高效、低成本且可扩展的异常检测方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable and interpretable framework for lane-wise
highway traffic anomaly detection, leveraging multi-modal time series data
extracted from surveillance cameras. Unlike traditional sensor-dependent
methods, our approach uses AI-powered vision models to extract lane-specific
features, including vehicle count, occupancy, and truck percentage, without
relying on costly hardware or complex road modeling. We introduce a novel
dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of
expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and
recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one
sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system
integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve
robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score,
providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent
transportation systems.

TL;DR: NeuroSim V1.5是一款用于模拟和优化模拟计算内存（ACIM）加速器的工具，通过支持更多神经网络类型、灵活的噪声注入方法和更快的运行速度，提升了ACIM的设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统冯·诺依曼架构在AI应用中存在能效和延迟问题，ACIM通过在内存中直接执行计算减少数据传输，但设计ACIM加速器需要准确建模设备和电路的非理想特性。

Method: NeuroSim V1.5集成了TensorRT的后训练量化流程，支持更多神经网络（如Transformer），提供灵活的噪声注入方法，扩展了设备支持，并优化了行为模拟以提高运行速度。

Result: NeuroSim V1.5比前一版本运行速度快6.5倍，支持更广泛的神经网络和设备类型，并通过案例研究展示了设计参数的优化。

Conclusion: NeuroSim V1.5通过高保真噪声建模和高效模拟，推动了下一代ACIM加速器的设计和验证，所有版本均为开源。

Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has
exposed the inefficiency of conventional von Neumann architectures, where
frequent data transfers between compute units and memory create significant
energy and latency bottlenecks. Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) addresses
this challenge by performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in
the memory arrays, substantially reducing data movement. However, designing
robust ACIM accelerators requires accurate modeling of device- and
circuit-level non-idealities. In this work, we present NeuroSim V1.5,
introducing several key advances: (1) seamless integration with TensorRT's
post-training quantization flow enabling support for more neural networks
including transformers, (2) a flexible noise injection methodology built on
pre-characterized statistical models, making it straightforward to incorporate
data from SPICE simulations or silicon measurements, (3) expanded device
support including emerging non-volatile capacitive memories, and (4) up to 6.5x
faster runtime than NeuroSim V1.4 through optimized behavioral simulation. The
combination of these capabilities uniquely enables systematic design space
exploration across both accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. Through
multiple case studies, we demonstrate optimization of critical design
parameters while maintaining network accuracy. By bridging high-fidelity noise
modeling with efficient simulation, NeuroSim V1.5 advances the design and
validation of next-generation ACIM accelerators. All NeuroSim versions are
available open-source at https://github.com/neurosim/NeuroSim.

*Nicolas Coloma,William Kleiber*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经贝叶斯估计（NBE）的快速、准确的Lévy过程参数估计方法，适用于金融建模中的高频率数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lévy过程在金融建模中广泛使用，但参数估计在似然函数不可用或计算成本高时存在挑战。

Method: 利用模拟数据和置换不变神经网络近似贝叶斯估计器，实现无似然函数的参数估计。

Result: NBE在多个Lévy模型中表现出优于传统方法的精度和运行效率，并能快速进行不确定性量化。

Conclusion: NBE为复杂金融模型提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability
to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency
asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when
associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast
and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes
estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that
leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes
estimators. Through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show
that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while
also enabling rapid bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. We illustrate
our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset,
where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and
interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional
methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in
complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty
quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally
investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less
than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.

Motivation: 在医学等领域，时间变化的治疗对生存结果的影响估计是一个挑战，现有方法在动态治疗方案中尚未充分探索。

Method: TV-SurvCaus结合序列建模处理时间依赖性，同时平衡时间相关的表示，并提供理论保证。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，TV-SurvCaus在估计时间变化的协变量和治疗效果方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TV-SurvCaus通过更准确地估计动态纵向设置中的治疗效果，推动了因果推断领域的发展。

Abstract: Estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes
is a challenging task in many domains, particularly in medicine where treatment
protocols adapt over time. While recent advances in representation learning
have improved causal inference for static treatments, extending these methods
to dynamic treatment regimes with survival outcomes remains under-explored. In
this paper, we introduce TV-SurvCaus, a novel framework that extends
representation balancing techniques to the time-varying treatment setting for
survival analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees through (1) a generalized
bound for time-varying precision in estimation of heterogeneous effects, (2)
variance control via sequential balancing weights, (3) consistency results for
dynamic treatment regimes, (4) convergence rates for representation learning
with temporal dependencies, and (5) a formal bound on the bias due to
treatment-confounder feedback. Our neural architecture incorporates sequence
modeling to handle temporal dependencies while balancing time-dependent
representations. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that TV-SurvCaus outperforms existing methods in
estimating individualized treatment effects with time-varying covariates and
treatments. Our framework advances the field of causal inference by enabling
more accurate estimation of treatment effects in dynamic, longitudinal settings
with survival outcomes.

Abstract: The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular framework for sequential
decision-making problems, and uncertainty quantification is an essential
component of it to learn optimal decision-making strategies. In particular, a
Bayesian framework is used to maintain beliefs about the optimal decisions and
the unknown ingredients of the model, which are also to be learned from the
data, such as the rewards and state dynamics. However, many existing Bayesian
approaches for learning the optimal decision-making strategy are based on
unrealistic modelling assumptions and utilise approximate inference techniques.
This raises doubts whether the benefits of Bayesian uncertainty quantification
are fully realised or can be relied upon.
  We focus on infinite-horizon and undiscounted MDPs, with finite state and
action spaces, and a terminal state. We provide a full Bayesian framework, from
modelling to inference to decision-making. For modelling, we introduce a
likelihood function with minimal assumptions for learning the optimal
action-value function based on Bellman's optimality equations, analyse its
properties, and clarify connections to existing works. For deterministic
rewards, the likelihood is degenerate and we introduce artificial observation
noise to relax it, in a controlled manner, to facilitate more efficient Monte
Carlo-based inference. For inference, we propose an adaptive sequential Monte
Carlo algorithm to both sample from and adjust the sequence of relaxed
posterior distributions. For decision-making, we choose actions using samples
from the posterior distribution over the optimal strategies. While commonly
done, we provide new insight that clearly shows that it is a generalisation of
Thompson sampling from multi-arm bandit problems. Finally, we evaluate our
framework on the Deep Sea benchmark problem and demonstrate the exploration
benefits of posterior sampling in MDPs.

Abstract: Individual treatment effect estimation has gained significant attention in
recent data science literature. This work introduces the Double Neural Network
(Double-NN) method to address this problem within the framework of extended
fiducial inference (EFI). In the proposed method, deep neural networks are used
to model the treatment and control effect functions, while an additional neural
network is employed to estimate their parameters. The universal approximation
capability of deep neural networks ensures the broad applicability of this
method. Numerical results highlight the superior performance of the proposed
Double-NN method compared to the conformal quantile regression (CQR) method in
individual treatment effect estimation. From the perspective of statistical
inference, this work advances the theory and methodology for statistical
inference of large models. Specifically, it is theoretically proven that the
proposed method permits the model size to increase with the sample size $n$ at
a rate of $O(n^{\zeta})$ for some $0 \leq \zeta<1$, while still maintaining
proper quantification of uncertainty in the model parameters. This result marks
a significant improvement compared to the range $0\leq \zeta < \frac{1}{2}$
required by the classical central limit theorem. Furthermore, this work
provides a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural
networks under the neural scaling law, representing a substantial contribution
to the statistical understanding of large-scale neural network models.

Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural
ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system
identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the
diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their
use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various
kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in
practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear
model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new
stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The
insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for
researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.

Abstract: Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying
time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications
such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several
time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four
decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or
association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new
dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC),
which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest
element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity.
It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated
and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the
RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different
seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by
clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption
time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.

Conclusion: 惯性扩散模型能有效生成新样本，并揭示了扩散模型与流形学习的有趣联系。

Abstract: Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data
samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data
distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples
from the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution
consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will
necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to
as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine
learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the
memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end
of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model
requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not
require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model
sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1
approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension
$d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance
between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the
inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper
bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no
training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion
model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density
estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between
diffusion model and manifold learning.

Motivation: 整合异构生物医学数据（如影像、组学和临床记录）以支持精准诊断和个性化治疗，但需要满足监管要求的可解释性。

Method: 对26项研究进行技术调查，分类为四种可解释性方法，并在阿尔茨海默病队列中比较了敏感性分析、梯度显著性、SHAP和图掩码的效果。

Result: SHAP和敏感性分析能识别最广泛的已知AD通路和基因本体术语，而梯度显著性和图掩码揭示了互补的代谢和运输特征。所有方法均优于随机基因集，但各有计算成本与精度的权衡。

Conclusion: 论文总结了可解释图学习的现状，提供了方法选择和资源分配的流程图，并为未来研究方向（如高级XAI工具和未充分研究的疾病）提供了参考。

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and
clinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based
models fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational
structure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We
present the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for
multimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and
Sep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static
graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare;
post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and
SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability
families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph
edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using
an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient
Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the
broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient
Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport
signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with
distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher
compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker
though coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph
construction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers
balance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of
interpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading
techniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to
under-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers
and translational scientists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测模型在数据稀缺和面对新表位时泛化能力不足，限制了免疫治疗和疫苗开发的进展。

Method: LANTERN利用ESM-1b编码TCR β链序列，将肽序列转化为SMILES字符串并通过MolFormer处理，结合生物和化学特征进行预测。

Result: LANTERN在零样本和少样本学习中优于现有模型（如ChemBERTa、TITAN和NetTCR），并通过嵌入分析显示出显著的聚类改进。

Conclusion: LANTERN有望推动TCR-pMHC结合预测，支持个性化免疫治疗的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and
peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy
and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with
generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel
epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced
Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale
protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding
TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences
into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological
and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive
benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR,
LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and
few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative
sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding
analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC
binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.

Conclusion: 结合ML与物理洞察的模型在气候预测和热带气旋风险评估中具有潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have
shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate
predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using NeuralGCM, a
hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model, for seasonal predictions of large-scale
atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity.
Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming
sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but
persist anomalies present at initialization. With such forcings, NeuralGCM
simulates realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns.
Furthermore, this configuration yields useful seasonal predictions
(July-November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics.
Notably, the prediction skill for TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East
Pacific basins is comparable to existing physical models. These findings
highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model
TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI-powered applications demands high-performance,
scalable, and efficient cloud database solutions, as traditional architectures
often struggle with AI-driven workloads requiring real-time data access, vector

PostgreSQL). It presents architectural patterns for integrating AI workloads
with cloud databases, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [1] with
LLMs, real-time data pipelines, AI-driven query optimization, and
embeddings-based search. Performance benchmarks, scalability considerations,

applications. Real-world case studies from industries such as healthcare,
finance, and customer experience illustrate how enterprises utilize cloud
databases to enhance AI capabilities while ensuring security, governance, and
compliance with enterprise and regulatory standards. By providing a
comprehensive analysis of AI and cloud database integration, this paper serves
as a practical guide for researchers, architects, and enterprises to build

Result: HoneyBee在RBAC工作负载中减少存储冗余，查询速度比RLS快6倍，存储仅增加1.4倍。

Conclusion: HoneyBee为安全高效的向量搜索提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As vector databases gain traction in enterprise applications, robust access
control has become critical to safeguard sensitive data. Access control in
these systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine
nearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user
permissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating
dedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces
excessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access
control after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor
recall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic
partitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by
leveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC,
widely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns
permissions to those roles, creating a natural "thin waist" in the permission
structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee
produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated
across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage
overhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of
the vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a
constrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query
efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee
reduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x
faster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage
increase, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector
search.

Conclusion: 该工作为基于多维分类的数据模型发展做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Organizing resources in a multidimensional classification space is an
approach to efficiently managing and querying large-scale resources. This paper
defines an aggregation query on subspace defined by a range on the partial
order on coordinate tree at each dimension, where each point contains resources
aggregated along the paths of partial order relations on the points so that
aggregated resources at each point within the subspace can be measured, ranked
and selected. To efficiently locate non-empty points in a large subspace, an
approach to generating graph index is proposed to build inclusion links with
partial order relations on coordinates of dimensions to enable a subspace query
to reach non-empty points by following indexing links and aggregate resources
along indexing paths back to their super points. Generating such an index is
costly as the number of children of an index node can be very large so that the
total number of indexing nodes is unbounded. The proposed approach adopts the
following strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between
two indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while
controlling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are
added between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated
for estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3)
coordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at
another dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes;
and, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate
trees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates. Analysis and
experiments verified the effectiveness of the generated index in supporting
subspace aggregation query. This work makes significant contributions to the
development of data model based on multi-dimensional classification.

Abstract: Behind a set of rules in Deontic Defeasible Logic, there is a mapping process
of normative background fragments. This process goes from text to rules and
implicitly encompasses an explanation of the coded fragments.
  In this paper we deliver a methodology for \textit{legal coding} that starts
with a fragment and goes onto a set of Deontic Defeasible Logic rules,
involving a set of \textit{scenarios} to test the correctness of the coded
fragments. The methodology is illustrated by the coding process of an example
text. We then show the results of a series of experiments conducted with humans
encoding a variety of normative backgrounds and corresponding cases in which we
have measured the efforts made in the coding process, as related to some
measurable features. To process these examples, a recently developed
technology, Houdini, that allows reasoning in Deontic Defeasible Logic, has
been employed.
  Finally we provide a technique to forecast time required in coding, that
depends on factors such as knowledge of the legal domain, knowledge of the
coding processes, length of the text, and a measure of \textit{depth} that
refers to the length of the paths of legal references.

Motivation: 多目标进化算法通常采用贪婪选择，而随机选择机制虽能加速计算，但仅适用于特定条件。本文旨在提出更通用的非精英选择机制。

Result: 证明新机制在常数k下即可实现加速，且加速因子为max{1,Θ(k)^{k−1}}，不依赖目标数。

Conclusion: 老龄化机制比随机选择更强大，支持非精英选择在多目标优化中的应用。

Abstract: Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is
an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always
select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception,
Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism
for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of
the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by
a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven
speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research
direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge
4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage
reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this
work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging,
which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal.
This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up
by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of
objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for
constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed.
Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but
suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than
stochastic selection mechanisms.

Motivation: SNN在能效上优于ANN，但传统转换方法需要大量时间步数才能匹配ANN精度，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出PASCAL方法，实现ANN-SNN的数学等效转换，并优化QCFS激活的量化步长配置。

Result: ResNet-34 SNN在ImageNet上达到约74%的准确率，推理时间步数减少64倍。

Conclusion: PASCAL显著提升了SNN的效率和实用性，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient
alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse
Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate
operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs
with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently
proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative
to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless,
SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of
the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which
performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is
mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding
similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In
addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of
QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal
number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the
ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on
ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps
compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有MetaBBO方法采用在线学习，效率较低，因此需要一种更高效的离线学习框架。

Method: 将动态算法配置任务转化为长序列决策过程，引入Q函数分解机制，并提出三种设计：平衡探索与利用的数据收集策略、分解Q损失结合保守Q学习、Mamba架构提升长序列学习效率。

Result: Q-Mamba在性能上与现有在线/离线基线相当或更优，同时显著提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: Q-Mamba是一种高效且有效的MetaBBO框架，适用于动态算法配置任务。

Abstract: Recent progress in Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) has demonstrated
that using RL to learn a meta-level policy for dynamic algorithm configuration
(DAC) over an optimization task distribution could significantly enhance the
performance of the low-level BBO algorithm. However, the online learning
paradigms in existing works makes the efficiency of MetaBBO problematic. To
address this, we propose an offline learning-based MetaBBO framework in this
paper, termed Q-Mamba, to attain both effectiveness and efficiency in MetaBBO.
Specifically, we first transform DAC task into long-sequence decision process.
This allows us further introduce an effective Q-function decomposition
mechanism to reduce the learning difficulty within the intricate algorithm
configuration space. Under this setting, we propose three novel designs to
meta-learn DAC policy from offline data: we first propose a novel collection
strategy for constructing offline DAC experiences dataset with balanced
exploration and exploitation. We then establish a decomposition-based Q-loss
that incorporates conservative Q-learning to promote stable offline learning
from the offline dataset. To further improve the offline learning efficiency,
we equip our work with a Mamba architecture which helps long-sequence learning
effectiveness and efficiency by selective state model and hardware-aware
parallel scan respectively. Through extensive benchmarking, we observe that
Q-Mamba achieves competitive or even superior performance to prior
online/offline baselines, while significantly improving the training efficiency
of existing online baselines. We provide sourcecodes of Q-Mamba at
https://github.com/MetaEvo/Q-Mamba.

### [254] [Adaptive Bidding Policies for First-Price Auctions with Budget Constraints under Non-stationarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02796)
*Yige Wang,Jiashuo Jiang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了预算受限的投标人如何在重复的一价拍卖中自适应出价以最大化累积收益，提出了一种基于双梯度下降的简单出价策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于行业从二价拍卖转向一价拍卖，真实出价不再最优，需研究新策略。

Method: 提出双梯度下降出价策略，考虑两种设置：无信息设置和预测信息设置。

Result: 无信息设置下遗憾为O(√T)加非平稳性项；预测信息设置下遗憾为O(√T)加预测误差项。

Conclusion: 双梯度下降策略在两种设置下均表现良好，预测信息可减少非平稳性影响。

Abstract: We study how a budget-constrained bidder should learn to adaptively bid in
repeated first-price auctions to maximize her cumulative payoff. This problem
arose due to an industry-wide shift from second-price auctions to first-price
auctions in display advertising recently, which renders truthful bidding (i.e.,
always bidding one's private value) no longer optimal. We propose a simple
dual-gradient-descent-based bidding policy that maintains a dual variable for
budget constraint as the bidder consumes her budget. In analysis, we consider
two settings regarding the bidder's knowledge of her private values in the
future: (i) an uninformative setting where all the distributional knowledge
(can be non-stationary) is entirely unknown to the bidder, and (ii) an
informative setting where a prediction of the budget allocation in advance. We
characterize the performance loss (or regret) relative to an optimal policy
with complete information on the stochasticity. For uninformative setting, We
show that the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus a variation term that reflects
the non-stationarity of the value distributions, and this is of optimal order.
We then show that we can get rid of the variation term with the help of the
prediction; specifically, the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus the prediction
error term in the informative setting.

TL;DR: AdaParse是一种自适应并行PDF解析引擎，通过结合人类偏好和硬件需求优化解析器选择，显著提升解析效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献多以PDF格式发布，解析方法多样但选择困难，需平衡计算成本和准确性。

Method: 引入AdaParse，结合直接偏好优化（DPO）和资源调度策略，动态选择最佳解析器。

Result: 在1000份科学文档测试中，吞吐量提升17倍，准确性提高0.2%。

Conclusion: AdaParse高效且可扩展，适用于大规模科学文档解析，支持高质量文本数据集构建。

Abstract: Language models for scientific tasks are trained on text from scientific
publications, most distributed as PDFs that require parsing. PDF parsing
approaches range from inexpensive heuristics (for simple documents) to
computationally intensive ML-driven systems (for complex or degraded ones). The
choice of the "best" parser for a particular document depends on its
computational cost and the accuracy of its output. To address these issues, we
introduce an Adaptive Parallel PDF Parsing and Resource Scaling Engine
(AdaParse), a data-driven strategy for assigning an appropriate parser to each
document. We enlist scientists to select preferred parser outputs and
incorporate this information through direct preference optimization (DPO) into
AdaParse, thereby aligning its selection process with human judgment. AdaParse
then incorporates hardware requirements and predicted accuracy of each parser
to orchestrate computational resources efficiently for large-scale parsing
campaigns. We demonstrate that AdaParse, when compared to state-of-the-art
parsers, improves throughput by $17\times$ while still achieving comparable
accuracy (0.2 percent better) on a benchmark set of 1000 scientific documents.
AdaParse's combination of high accuracy and parallel scalability makes it
feasible to parse large-scale scientific document corpora to support the
development of high-quality, trillion-token-scale text datasets. The
implementation is available at https://github.com/7shoe/AdaParse/

TL;DR: Tricolore是一个多向量学习框架，通过捕捉不同行为类型之间的联系，提升推荐系统的多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统通常针对单一行为优化，无法处理多行为或多目标优化，导致推荐结果单一。

Method: Tricolore采用自适应多任务结构和行为级多视图融合模块，动态增强学习，并通过流行度平衡策略提升多样性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，Tricolore在多种推荐场景中表现优异，并显著提升了冷启动用户的性能。

Conclusion: Tricolore通过多向量学习和共享基础嵌入策略，有效解决了传统推荐系统的局限性。

Abstract: Online platforms aggregate extensive user feedback across diverse behaviors,
providing a rich source for enhancing user engagement. Traditional recommender
systems, however, typically optimize for a single target behavior and represent
user preferences with a single vector, limiting their ability to handle
multiple important behaviors or optimization objectives. This conventional
approach also struggles to capture the full spectrum of user interests,
resulting in a narrow item pool during candidate generation. To address these
limitations, we present Tricolore, a versatile multi-vector learning framework
that uncovers connections between different behavior types for more robust
candidate generation. Tricolore's adaptive multi-task structure is also
customizable to specific platform needs. To manage the variability in sparsity
across behavior types, we incorporate a behavior-wise multi-view fusion module
that dynamically enhances learning. Moreover, a popularity-balanced strategy
ensures the recommendation list balances accuracy with item popularity,
fostering diversity and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
public datasets demonstrate Tricolore's effectiveness across various
recommendation scenarios, from short video platforms to e-commerce. By
leveraging a shared base embedding strategy, Tricolore also significantly
improves the performance for cold-start users. The source code is publicly

Result: 确认激活修补方法能定位模型行为，词频信息跨语言通用，且序列级任务信息集中在CLS标记。

Conclusion: 研究强调了信息检索可解释性和机器学习研究可重复性的重要性。

Abstract: This reproducibility study analyzes and extends the paper "Axiomatic Causal
Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval
Models," which investigates how neural retrieval models encode task-relevant
properties such as term frequency. We reproduce key experiments from the
original paper, confirming that information on query terms is captured in the
model encoding. We extend this work by applying activation patching to Spanish
and Chinese datasets and by exploring whether document-length information is
encoded in the model as well. Our results confirm that the designed activation
patching method can isolate the behavior to specific components and tokens in
neural retrieval models. Moreover, our findings indicate that the location of
term frequency generalizes across languages and that in later layers, the
information for sequence-level tasks is represented in the CLS token. The
results highlight the need for further research into interpretability in
information retrieval and reproducibility in machine learning research. Our

Motivation: 知识图谱在广泛应用中存在社会偏见，可能对少数群体造成不公平影响，需系统性检测。

Method: 开发AuditLP框架，利用公平性指标分析链接预测中的偏见，实验基于Wikidata的21个地理区域数据。

Result: 研究发现职业分类的偏见与全球社会经济文化差异一致，明显区分了全球北方和南方。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的偏见反映了现实世界的社会不平等，需进一步研究和改进以减少负面影响。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs have become increasingly popular due to their wide usage in
various downstream applications, including information retrieval, chatbot
development, language model construction, and many others. Link prediction (LP)
is a crucial downstream task for knowledge graphs, as it helps to address the
problem of the incompleteness of the knowledge graphs. However, previous
research has shown that knowledge graphs, often created in a (semi) automatic
manner, are not free from social biases. These biases can have harmful effects
on downstream applications, especially by leading to unfair behavior toward
minority groups. To understand this issue in detail, we develop a framework --
AuditLP -- deploying fairness metrics to identify biased outcomes in LP,
specifically how occupations are classified as either male or female-dominated
based on gender as a sensitive attribute. We have experimented with the
sensitive attribute of age and observed that occupations are categorized as
young-biased, old-biased, and age-neutral. We conduct our experiments on a
large number of knowledge triples that belong to 21 different geographies
extracted from the open-sourced knowledge graph, Wikidata. Our study shows that
the variance in the biased outcomes across geographies neatly mirrors the
socio-economic and cultural division of the world, resulting in a transparent
partition of the Global North from the Global South.

Motivation: 在分布式多传感器ISAC系统中，高维观测数据在速率受限网络中的传输限制了系统性能，需要一种有效的压缩方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于自动编码器的观测压缩方法，并结合LQR系统进行案例分析。

Result: 结果表明，在资源分配中，低噪声传感器优先获得资源，直到压缩无损后再分配给高噪声传感器。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了速率受限网络中的观测数据传输问题，并优化了资源分配策略。

Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional
sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present
a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and
then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome
the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this
framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation,
compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state
estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our
results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes
low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources
are reallocated to high-noise sensors.

Motivation: 研究动机是解释神经网络训练中观察到的‘双下降’现象，即在模型复杂度或训练时间增加时，训练误差先降后升再降的现象。

Method: 方法是通过两时间尺度随机逼近理论和奇异扰动微分方程，分析梯度动态的连续时间极限。

Result: 研究结果为‘双下降’现象提供了动态角度的理论解释。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为神经网络训练中的动态行为提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that overparametrized neural networks
exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity, as
reflected in the number of features, increases, the training error initially
decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this
phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise
training, viz., that the training error decreases with time, then increases,
then decreases again. This note presents a plausible explanation for this
phenomenon by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation and
singularly perturbed differential equations, applied to the continuous time
limit of the gradient dynamics. This adds a `dynamic' angle to an already well
studied theme.

Conclusion: 新算法在规划和学习问题中均表现出优越性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning
problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy
iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition
probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation
is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding
transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to
optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity
as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning
algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations,
however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms
first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and
learning problems.

Conclusion: LBBD和LNS算法在解决泛化Pickup and Delivery Problem中表现出色，LNS尤其适用于大规模实例。

Abstract: This paper examines the generalisation of the Pickup and Delivery Problem
that allows mid-route load exchanges among vehicles and obeys strict
time-windows at all locations. We propose a novel Logic-Based Benders
Decomposition (LBBD) that improves optimality gaps for all benchmarks in the
literature and scales up to handle larger ones. To tackle even larger
instances, we introduce a refined Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm
that improves the adaptability of LNS beyond case-specific configurations
appearing in related literature.
  To bridge the gap in benchmark availability, we develop an instance generator
that allows for extensive experimentation. For moderate datasets (25 and 50
requests), we evaluate the performance of both LBBD and LNS, the former being
able to close the gap and the latter capable of providing near-optimal
solutions. For larger instances (75 and 100 requests), we recreate indicative
state-of-the-art metaheuristics to highlight the improvements introduced by our
LNS refinements, while establishing its scalability.

Result: 稀疏代理网络即使未经微调（分类性能较差），也能更高效地生成对抗扰动。

Conclusion: 剪枝后的网络即使性能下降，仍可作为高效代理，提升优化效率。

Abstract: We can approximate a constraint or an objective function that is uncertain or
nonlinear with a neural network that we embed in the optimization model. This
approach, which is known as constraint learning, faces the challenge that
optimization models with neural network surrogates are harder to solve. Such
difficulties have motivated studies on model reformulation, specialized
optimization algorithms, and - to a lesser extent - pruning of the embedded
networks. In this work, we double down on the use of surrogates by applying
network pruning to produce a surrogate of the neural network itself. In the
context of using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to verify
neural networks, we obtained faster adversarial perturbations for dense neural
networks by using sparse surrogates, especially - and surprisingly - if not
taking the time to finetune the sparse network to make up for the loss in
accuracy. In other words, we show that a pruned network with bad classification
performance can still be a good - and more efficient - surrogate.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing
zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly
quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings.
For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a
global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC
functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of
proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained
case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the
algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled
under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through
investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems
in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where
the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation
for this phenomenon.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a powerful tool for many machine learning problems,
such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Estimating
hypergradients (also known as implicit gradients) is crucial for developing
gradient-based methods for bilevel optimization. In this work, we propose a
computationally efficient technique for incorporating curvature information
into the approximation of hypergradients and present a novel algorithmic
framework based on the resulting enhanced hypergradient computation. We provide
convergence rate guarantees for the proposed framework in both deterministic
and stochastic scenarios, particularly showing improved computational
complexity over popular gradient-based methods in the deterministic setting.
This improvement in complexity arises from a careful exploitation of the
hypergradient structure and the inexact Newton method. In addition to the
theoretical speedup, numerical experiments demonstrate the significant
practical performance benefits of incorporating curvature information.

Abstract: Discrete time linear dynamical systems, including Markov chains, have found
many applications. However, in some problems, there is uncertainty about the
time horizon for which the system runs. This creates uncertainty about the cost
(or reward) incurred based on the state distribution when the system stops.
Given past data samples of how long a system ran, we propose to theoretically
analyze a distributional robust cost estimation task in a Wasserstein ambiguity
set, instead of learning a probability distribution from a few samples. Towards
this, we show an equivalence between a discrete time Markov Chain on a
probability simplex and a global asymptotic stable (GAS) discrete time linear
dynamical system, allowing us to base our study on a GAS system only. Then, we
provide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different
cases in our theoretical study, including a fundamental result about
Wasserstein distance based polytope.

parameter, our approach encodes the number N in the set of natural numbers
through the cumulative balance of a smooth function f_N(t), constructed from
localized Gaussian bumps with alternating and decaying coefficients. The total
integral I(N) converges to zero as N tends to infinity, and the integer can be
recovered as the minimal point of near-cancellation.
  This method enables continuous and differentiable representations of discrete
states, supports recovery through spline-based or analytical inversion, and
extends naturally to multidimensional tuples (N1, N2, ...). We analyze the
structure and convergence of the encoding series, demonstrate numerical
construction of the integral map I(N), and develop procedures for integer
recovery via numerical inversion. The resulting framework opens a path toward
embedding discrete logic within continuous optimization pipelines, machine
learning architectures, and smooth symbolic computation.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了公交车司机排班问题（BDSP），提出了一种结合精确方法（Branch and Price）和大邻域搜索（LNS）的混合方法，通过存储和重用生成的列来优化全局解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BDSP是一个受严格法律和集体协议约束的组合优化问题，目标是设计兼顾运营成本和司机满意度的班次。现有方法难以高效解决不同规模的实例。

Method: 提出了Branch and Price（B&P）和Large Neighborhood Search（LNS）的混合方法，其中LNS使用B&P或列生成（CG）进行修复，并存储生成的列以供重用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法为不同规模的实例提供了最新最优解，包括小实例的精确解和中型实例的低差距解。

Conclusion: B&P对小实例效果最佳，而LNS与CG的紧密集成能高效解决大实例。方法具有通用性，可应用于其他规则集和相关优化问题。

Abstract: The Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) is a combinatorial optimization
problem with the goal to design shifts to cover prearranged bus tours. The
objective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction
of drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and
collective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide
state-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide
high-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a
comprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as
a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation
(CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates
a novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from
the LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better
global solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several
components of the solution methods and their impact, including general
improvements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource
Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The
evaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for
instances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low
gaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe
that B&P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight
integration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger
instances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box. The
proposed methods are general and can also be applied to other rule sets and
related optimization problems

Result: 获得了亚线性和线性收敛结果，并推广了收敛性到任意凸L-光滑函数。

Conclusion: 改进的步长方法有效解决了无界域问题，同时避免了指数运算的复杂性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on applying entropic mirror descent to solve linear
systems, where the main challenge for the convergence analysis stems from the
unboundedness of the domain. To overcome this without imposing restrictive
assumptions, we introduce a variant of Polyak-type stepsizes. Along the way, we
strengthen the bound for $\ell_1$-norm implicit bias, obtain sublinear and
linear convergence results, and generalize the convergence result to arbitrary
convex $L$-smooth functions. We also propose an alternative method that avoids
exponentiation, resembling the original Hadamard descent, but with provable
convergence.

Conclusion: 初步结果表明低红移AGN可能作为高红移AGN的替代，为研究AGN演化提供新途径。

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the
universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However,
understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental
challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can
serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying
spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line
properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key
spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data
Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C
IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and
UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width,
velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and
continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent
lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly
similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share
intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the
better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.

performance of affective models. Finally, the survey outlines ethical
considerations and proposes future directions to develop applications that are

Abstract: Gaze may enhance the robustness of lie detectors but remains under-studied.
This study evaluated the efficacy of AI models (using fixations, saccades,
blinks, and pupil size) for detecting deception in Concealed Information Tests
across two datasets. The first, collected with Eyelink 1000, contains gaze data
from a computerized experiment where 87 participants revealed, concealed, or
faked the value of a previously selected card. The second, collected with Pupil
Neon, involved 36 participants performing a similar task but facing an
experimenter. XGBoost achieved accuracies up to 74% in a binary classification

patient simulation and automated feedback system. SOPHIE combines large
language models (LLMs), a lifelike virtual avatar, and automated, personalized
feedback based on clinical literature to provide remote, on-demand SIC
training. In a randomized control study with healthcare students and
professionals, SOPHIE users demonstrated significant improvement across three
critical SIC domains: Empathize, Be Explicit, and Empower. These results
suggest that AI-driven tools can enhance complex interpersonal communication
skills, offering scalable, accessible solutions to address a critical gap in
clinician education.

Conclusion: PathVis通过混合现实和AI技术优化了病理诊断工作流程，提升了病理学家的体验。

Abstract: Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases
like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense
scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the
limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning
and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue,
and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our
mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these
challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing
cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using
natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace.
PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function
instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases
side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid
comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers
real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among
pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of
traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis
improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology
practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video

Motivation: 绝缘材料的介电响应是设计电气绝缘系统和定义高压设备安全运行条件的关键信息，但传统等效电路模型（ECMs）难以解释复杂的物理过程。

Method: 使用PINNs对时域DR进行逆建模，通过合成数据（含高斯噪声）验证其性能，并扩展ECMs以包含温度依赖性。

Conclusion: PINNs为依赖ECMs的学科提供了广泛潜在应用的解决方案，结合了机器学习在科学计算中的最新技术。

Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for
designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions
of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and
conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to
physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results,
equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of
the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant
response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits.
To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from
analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to
simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective
at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five
unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size,
training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs
to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately
recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at
different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents
a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on
ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific
computation.

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial
research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in
natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots'
ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the
procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open
environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive
capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge,
a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It
consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale
pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation
(IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA).
RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural
skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition
and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over
existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83%
average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world
data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards
integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems,
offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合大型语言模型推理，低成本机器人也能实现智能、上下文感知的行为，无需复杂硬件或微调。

Abstract: Classical robot navigation often relies on hardcoded state machines and
purely geometric path planners, limiting a robot's ability to interpret
high-level semantic instructions. In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's
ability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a
hybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on
a low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates
explicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4
reasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by
A*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and
environmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to
avoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route
selection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle
buffering to enforce semantic constraints. We demonstrate multi-step reasoning
for sequential tasks, such as first navigating to a resource goal and then
reaching a final destination safely. Experiments on a Petoi Bittle robot with
an overhead camera and Raspberry Pi Zero 2W compare classical A* against
GPT-4-assisted planning. Results show that while A* is faster and more accurate
for basic route generation and obstacle avoidance, the GPT-4-integrated system
achieves high success rates (96-100%) on semantic tasks that are infeasible for
pure geometric planners. This work highlights how affordable robots can exhibit
intelligent, context-aware behaviors by leveraging large language model
reasoning with minimal hardware and no fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LanBLoc-BMM及其安全导航方法在战场环境中具有高效性和实用性，适用于复杂动态场景。

Abstract: In battlefield environments, adversaries frequently disrupt GPS signals,
requiring alternative localization and navigation methods. Traditional
vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and
Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational
demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability
challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a
navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a
battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its
performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization
algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and
real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement
Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average
Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior
performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two
safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by
integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm
for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in
battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk
exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior
computational speed.

Abstract: Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed
of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The
configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission
objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer
from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited
support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning
algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous
reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple
target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay
and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant
obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs,
our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target
configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units,
respectively.

Method: 利用物理启发的波动方程（如Westervelt、KZK）捕捉高阶声学现象，并将其嵌入强化学习驱动的控制循环中，自适应优化关键参数（如吸收、波束成形）。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic
computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot
interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically
informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures
higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By
embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the
system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to
mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental
evaluations-covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and
multilingual speech recognition-demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses
traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior
noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world
scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI
hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine
interfaces.

Motivation: 开发T-Rex旨在推动可控环境农业（CEA）中植物采样自动化，解决叶片定位和抓取的挑战。

Result: 实验表明，T-Rex在人工植物上能稳定检测、规划并执行物理交互，抓取成功率为66.6%。

Conclusion: T-Rex为CEA中的植物采样自动化提供了可行方案，展示了其潜力和改进空间。

Abstract: T-Rex (The Robot for Extracting Leaf Samples) is a gantry-based robotic
system developed for autonomous leaf localization, selection, and grasping in
greenhouse environments. The system integrates a 6-degree-of-freedom
manipulator with a stereo vision pipeline to identify and interact with target
leaves. YOLOv8 is used for real-time leaf segmentation, and RAFT-Stereo
provides dense depth maps, allowing the reconstruction of 3D leaf masks. These
observations are processed through a leaf grasping algorithm that selects the
optimal leaf based on clutter, visibility, and distance, and determines a grasp
point by analyzing local surface flatness, top-down approachability, and margin
from edges. The selected grasp point guides a trajectory executed by ROS-based
motion controllers, driving a custom microneedle-equipped end-effector to clamp
the leaf and simulate tissue sampling. Experiments conducted with artificial
plants under varied poses demonstrate that the T-Rex system can consistently
detect, plan, and perform physical interactions with plant-like targets,
achieving a grasp success rate of 66.6\%. This paper presents the system
architecture, implementation, and testing of T-Rex as a step toward plant
sampling automation in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).

Abstract: Building models responsive to input prompts represents a transformative shift
in machine learning. This paradigm holds significant potential for robotics
problems, such as targeted manipulation amidst clutter. In this work, we
present a novel approach to combine promptable foundation models with
reinforcement learning (RL), enabling robots to perform dexterous manipulation
tasks in a prompt-responsive manner. Existing methods struggle to link
high-level commands with fine-grained dexterous control. We address this gap
with a memory-augmented student-teacher learning framework. We use the
Segment-Anything 2 (SAM 2) model as a perception backbone to infer an object of
interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal
sequence provides rich information for implicit state estimation by
memory-augmented models. Our approach successfully learns prompt-responsive
policies, demonstrated in picking objects from cluttered scenes. Videos and

Abstract: Quadruped robots are currently a widespread platform for robotics research,
thanks to powerful Reinforcement Learning controllers and the availability of
cheap and robust commercial platforms. However, to broaden the adoption of the
technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only
on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step
towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost
quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided
kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing
stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two
different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an
accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate
autonomously. Furthermore, we present in-depth ablation studies of the
important components of the system and their impact on localization accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动混合奖励调度（AHRS）框架，动态调整奖励组件的学习强度，提升高自由度机器人技能学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高自由度机器人学习技能复杂，现有强化学习方法对所有奖励组件不加区分地求和，效率低且限制学习性能。

Method: 设计多分支价值网络，每个分支对应不同奖励组件，利用LLM动态计算权重调整学习强度。

Result: 实验显示AHRS方法在多个任务中平均性能提升6.48%。

Conclusion: AHRS框架通过动态奖励调度显著提升机器人学习效率。

Abstract: Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a
challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such
problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for
various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all
reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and
policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy
optimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To
address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the
learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization
process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner.
Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch
corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each
branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are
automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a
rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it
selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts
that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate
that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across
multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.

Abstract: Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial
well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered
prostheses remains an open challenge. To address this gap, we developed a
force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals.
The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary
finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired
subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate
fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the
prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated
through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in
predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the
prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight
the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality
of prosthetic fingers.

Conclusion: GtG 2.0在灵活性和可靠性上表现优异，成为当前最先进的抓取框架之一。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection in cluttered, real-world environments remains a
significant challenge due to noisy and incomplete sensory data combined with
complex object geometries. This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0)
method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics
grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for
efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of
GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp
detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds
and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to
efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an
ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper
jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This
improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous
methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in
Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to
hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among
the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and
Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of
100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.

Abstract: Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental step
toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion
providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most
current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated
whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or
manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System
(TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through whole-body motion
imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by retargeting human motion
capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust, adaptive, and
responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement learning
and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how
incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture
(MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid
robots to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor
skills--spanning whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and
expressive movement--using a single unified neural network controller. Our

Method: 提出了一种混合深度学习模型，结合SSA、MA-EMD和TCNs，用于资产价格预测。实验中使用噪声减少预处理，并与三种多变量分解基准模型进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，噪声减少预处理提高了模型准确性，提出的模型在预测性能上显著优于基准模型。投资组合实验表明，该模型在短期持有期内表现优于Mean-Variance、等权重和市场权重模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合混合预测模型和Black-Litterman模型，能够生成具有更高收益和更好风险控制的投资组合，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The sensitivity to input parameters and lack of flexibility limits the
traditional Mean-Variance model. In contrast, the Black-Litterman model has
attracted widespread attention by integrating market equilibrium returns with
investors' subjective views. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning
model combining Singular Spectrum analysis (SSA), Multivariate Aligned
Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD), and Temporal Convolutional Networks
(TCNs), aiming to improve the prediction accuracy of asset prices and thus
enhance the ability of the Black-Litterman model to generate subjective views.
Experimental results show that noise reduction pre-processing can improve the
model's accuracy, and the prediction performance of the proposed model is
significantly better than that of three multivariate decomposition benchmark
models. We construct an investment portfolio by using 20 representative stocks
from the NASDAQ 100 index. By combining the hybrid forecasting model with the
Black-Litterman model, the generated investment portfolio exhibits better
returns and risk control capabilities than the Mean-Variance, Equal-Weighted,
and Market-Weighted models in the short holding period.

Abstract: The Limit Order Book (LOB), the mostly fundamental data of the financial
market, provides a fine-grained view of market dynamics while poses significant
challenges in dealing with the esteemed deep models due to its strong
autocorrelation, cross-feature constrains, and feature scale disparity.
Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific
downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned
representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and
generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of
LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting
transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We
introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market
data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation
metrics, and strong baselines. Extensive experiments validate the sufficiency
and necessity of LOB representations for various downstream tasks and highlight
their advantages over both the traditional task-specific end-to-end models and
the advanced representation learning models for general time series. Our work
establishes a reproducible framework and provides clear guidelines for future
research. Datasets and code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants.
Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are
expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This
paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that
select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric
is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and
underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation
techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my
knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this
lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier
League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the
highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte
Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating
cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during
the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the
optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable
insights into effective fantasy football strategies.

Motivation: 解决高吞吐量神经网络推理中优化决策（如并行分块、微内核选择和数据布局）的搜索空间过大问题，现有启发式方法覆盖范围有限。

Method: 采用动态规划方法，将大程序规范分解为可通过重写获得的小规范，并通过仿射成本模型选择最优程序。使用压缩的备忘录表减少内存需求。

Result: 开发的Morello编译器能够生成高性能程序，例如在Zen 1 CPU上优化的矩阵乘法，并被集成到Google的gemma.cpp中。

Conclusion: 仿射成本模型足以生成高吞吐量程序，动态规划方法显著扩展了可探索的搜索空间。

Abstract: High-throughput neural network inference requires coordinating many
optimization decisions, including parallel tiling, microkernel selection, and
data layout. The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs
which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g.,
auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space
heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach
to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program
specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites,
then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost
model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table
representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and
compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger
set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed
Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a
few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost
model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello
synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1
CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply,
which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.

Motivation: 研究旨在了解学生对AI聊天机器人在教育中的看法，以平衡其潜在益处与风险。

Method: 通过在美国一所大型公立大学进行问卷调查，对262名本科生的回答进行主题分析。

Result: 学生认为AI聊天机器人能提供反馈和学习支持，但也担忧学术诚信、信息准确性及过度依赖等问题。

Conclusion: 建议制定明确的AI使用政策并开展AI素养教育，以充分利用AI潜力并保障学习过程的完整性。

Abstract: The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational
settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching
and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns
about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve
independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students'
perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a
large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262
undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks
of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.
  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with
feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information
being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic
integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the
potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data
privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements
in education.
  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks
of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between
human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is
flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can
establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI
literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and
implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as
immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance
the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity
of the learning process with AI.

Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清AI安全的定义，避免因定义模糊导致研究方向的偏差。

Method: 采用概念工程的方法，分析并比较了‘安全概念’与当前AI安全研究中的两种趋势。

Result: 研究发现‘安全概念’更合理，能统一历史核心与边缘议题，避免人为区分。

Conclusion: 结论认为应采纳‘安全概念’，以更全面和公正地评估AI安全研究。

Abstract: The field of AI safety seeks to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI
systems. A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as
a field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls
within the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the
harms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety
Conception of AI safety. Despite its simplicity and appeal, we argue that The
Safety Conception is in tension with at least two trends in the ways AI safety
researchers and organizations think and talk about AI safety: first, a tendency
to characterize the goal of AI safety research in terms of catastrophic risks
from future systems; second, the increasingly popular idea that AI safety can
be thought of as a branch of safety engineering. Adopting the methodology of
conceptual engineering, we argue that these trends are unfortunate: when we
consider what concept of AI safety it would be best to have, there are
compelling reasons to think that The Safety Conception is the answer.
Descriptively, The Safety Conception allows us to see how work on topics that
have historically been treated as central to the field of AI safety is
continuous with work on topics that have historically been treated as more
marginal, like bias, misinformation, and privacy. Normatively, taking The
Safety Conception seriously means approaching all efforts to prevent or
mitigate harms from AI systems based on their merits rather than drawing
arbitrary distinctions between them.

Voice Response (IVR) technologies to become critical interfaces for customer
engagement. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) now driving these platforms,
ensuring secure, compliant, and ethically designed development practices is
more imperative than ever. AI-powered IVRs leverage Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to personalize interactions, automate service
delivery, and optimize user experiences. However, these innovations expose
systems to heightened risks, including data privacy breaches, AI decision
opacity, and model security vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes the evolution
of IVRs from static code-based designs to adaptive AI-driven systems,
presenting a cybersecurity-centric perspective. We propose a practical
governance framework that embeds agile security principles, compliance with
global data legislation, and user-centric ethics. Emphasizing
privacy-by-design, adaptive risk modeling, and transparency, the paper argues
that ethical AI integration is not a feature but a strategic imperative.
Through this multidimensional lens, we highlight how modern IVRs can transition
from communication tools to intelligent, secure, and accountable digital
frontlines-resilient against emerging threats and aligned with societal
expectations.

*Zexi Yao,Nataša Krčo,Georgi Ganev,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文指出，虽然距离最近记录（DCR）等代理指标被广泛用于评估合成数据的隐私性，但这些指标无法有效识别隐私泄露，且与实际的成员推理攻击（MIA）风险无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据被广泛用于保护敏感信息，但现有的隐私评估方法（如DCR）存在缺陷，可能导致错误的隐私结论。

Method: 通过多数据集和多种模型（如Baynet、CTGAN和扩散模型）的实验，验证DCR等指标在识别隐私泄露方面的无效性。

Result: 实验表明，被代理指标判定为隐私的合成数据在实际MIA中高度脆弱，且这些指标的超参数设置和记录选择方法均无法改善其表现。

Conclusion: DCR等距离指标设计上存在缺陷，应转向更严格的MIA作为评估合成数据隐私的标准，尤其是在法律匿名性声明中。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become an increasingly popular way to share data without
revealing sensitive information. Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are
widely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a
synthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy
metrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate
privacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated
synthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the
training data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary
privacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data
than the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this
work we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other
distance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple
datasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent
diffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are
highly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and
the continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual
membership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent
across different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods.
Finally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design
and show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work,
we hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as
the rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data,
in particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在保护数据隐私的同时面临通信效率和投毒攻击的挑战，稀疏化技术虽减少通信开销但增加了安全风险。

Method: FLARE结合稀疏索引掩码检查和模型更新符号相似性分析，针对稀疏化FL设计防御机制。

Result: 实验表明，FLARE在多种数据集和攻击场景下显著优于现有防御策略，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: FLARE成功填补了稀疏化FL的安全防御空白，有效抵御投毒攻击。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant
challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks.
While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting
only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks:
adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade
model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL
communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities
within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated
learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model
update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in
sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial
scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense
strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while
maintaining communication efficiency.

framework. The topics shall be utilised to detect vulnerabilities within
relevant CI/CD pipeline records or log data. This application of Topic
Modelling anticipates providing a new form of vulnerability detection,
improving overall security throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

Abstract: Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms,
creating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety
frameworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but
enable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network
effects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and
data poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help
adversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic
level. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain
understudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI
security, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory,
distributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce
\textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of
decentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their
interactionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other,
humans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance
trade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising
from interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in
decentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing
open challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments.
By identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to
unlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the
internet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical
infrastructure and defense contexts.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了O-RAN架构从单运营商转向多运营商时引入的安全挑战，提出了APATE攻击和MARRS检测框架，展示了攻击效果和检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究O-RAN在多运营商环境下的安全漏洞，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 开发了集成无线网络模拟器和O-RAN RIC集群的测试平台，提出APATE攻击和MARRS检测框架。

Result: APATE攻击使恶意小区获得248.5%的额外UE分配；MARRS检测准确率达99.2%，F1分数0.978。

Conclusion: 多运营商O-RAN存在安全风险，MARRS能有效检测恶意行为，为未来安全设计提供参考。

Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is revolutionizing
cellular networks with its open, multi-vendor design and AI-driven management,
aiming to enhance flexibility and reduce costs. Although it has many
advantages, O-RAN is not threat-free. While previous studies have mainly
examined vulnerabilities arising from O-RAN's intelligent components, this
paper is the first to focus on the security challenges and vulnerabilities
introduced by transitioning from single-operator to multi-operator RAN
architectures. This shift increases the risk of untrusted third-party operators
managing different parts of the network. To explore these vulnerabilities and
their potential mitigation, we developed an open-access testbed environment
that integrates a wireless network simulator with the official O-RAN Software
Community (OSC) RAN intelligent component (RIC) cluster. This environment
enables realistic, live data collection and serves as a platform for
demonstrating APATE (adversarial perturbation against traffic efficiency), an
evasion attack in which a malicious cell manipulates its reported key
performance indicators (KPIs) and deceives the O-RAN traffic steering to gain
unfair allocations of user equipment (UE). To ensure that O-RAN's legitimate
activity continues, we introduce MARRS (monitoring adversarial RAN reports), a
detection framework based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE)
that learns contextual features across the network to monitor malicious
telemetry (also demonstrated in our testbed). Our evaluation showed that by
executing APATE, an attacker can obtain a 248.5% greater UE allocation than it
was supposed to in a benign scenario. In addition, the MARRS detection method
was also shown to successfully classify malicious cell activity, achieving
accuracy of 99.2% and an F1 score of 0.978.

Motivation: 经典密码学在量子攻击下脆弱，尤其在敏感领域（如医疗）需长期安全保护。

Method: 采用ML-DSA-65签名验证模型更新，结合优化的智能合约进行去中心化验证。

Result: PQS-BFL在多个数据集上表现高效（签名时间0.65 ms，验证时间0.53 ms），区块链开销可控（交易时间4.8 s），模型准确率保持高水准（如MNIST达98.8%）。

Conclusion: PQS-BFL证明后量子密码学在联邦学习中可行，长期安全性与性能兼备。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but its classical cryptographic underpinnings are vulnerable to
quantum attacks. This vulnerability is particularly critical in sensitive
domains like healthcare. This paper introduces PQS-BFL (Post-Quantum Secure
Blockchain-based Federated Learning), a framework integrating post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) with blockchain verification to secure FL against quantum
adversaries. We employ ML-DSA-65 (a FIPS 204 standard candidate, formerly
Dilithium) signatures to authenticate model updates and leverage optimized
smart contracts for decentralized validation. Extensive evaluations on diverse
datasets (MNIST, SVHN, HAR) demonstrate that PQS-BFL achieves efficient
cryptographic operations (average PQC sign time: 0.65 ms, verify time: 0.53 ms)
with a fixed signature size of 3309 Bytes. Blockchain integration incurs a
manageable overhead, with average transaction times around 4.8 s and gas usage
per update averaging 1.72 x 10^6 units for PQC configurations. Crucially, the
cryptographic overhead relative to transaction time remains minimal (around
0.01-0.02% for PQC with blockchain), confirming that PQC performance is not the
bottleneck in blockchain-based FL. The system maintains competitive model
accuracy (e.g., over 98.8% for MNIST with PQC) and scales effectively, with
round times showing sublinear growth with increasing client numbers. Our
open-source implementation and reproducible benchmarks validate the feasibility
of deploying long-term, quantum-resistant security in practical FL systems.

Result: 提高了非完整树的分类器评估效率，并有效缓解了侧信道攻击。

Conclusion: 新协议在效率和安全性上优于现有方法，适用于隐私保护的分类任务。

Abstract: A decision tree is an easy-to-understand tool that has been widely used for
classification tasks. On the one hand, due to privacy concerns, there has been
an urgent need to create privacy-preserving classifiers that conceal the user's
input from the classifier. On the other hand, with the rise of cloud computing,
data owners are keen to reduce risk by outsourcing their model, but want
security guarantees that third parties cannot steal their decision tree model.
To address these issues, Joye and Salehi introduced a theoretical protocol that
efficiently evaluates decision trees while maintaining privacy by leveraging
their comparison protocol that is resistant to timing attacks. However, their
approach was not only inefficient but also prone to side-channel attacks.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new decision tree inference protocol in
which the model is shared and evaluated among multiple entities. We partition
our decision tree model by each level to be stored in a new entity we refer to
as a "level-site." Utilizing this approach, we were able to gain improved
average run time for classifier evaluation for a non-complete tree, while also
having strong mitigations against side-channel attacks.

Abstract: Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems,
essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience.
Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in
static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam
tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These
challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on
extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the
effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam
detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information
from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework,
the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam
detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam
detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining,
making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial
environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot
learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights
into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam
detection tasks.

misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public Internet, posing
significant security and system engineering risks. Aims: This study aims to
unveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild
through a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure
characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We
conducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM
deployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted
158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on
capabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations,
authentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment
trends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our
study shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure.
Among all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS
configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security
risks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are
pervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger
deployment practices. Conclusions: Public-facing LLM deployments suffer from
widespread security and configuration flaws, exposing services to misuse, model
theft, resource hijacking, and remote exploitation. Strengthening default
security, deployment practices, and operational standards is critical for the
growing self-hosted LLM ecosystem.

Abstract: To accommodate ever-increasing model complexity, modern machine learning (ML)
systems have to scale to large GPU clusters. Changes in ML model architecture,
ML system implementation, and cluster configuration can significantly affect
overall ML system performance. However, quantifying the performance impact
before deployment is challenging. Existing performance estimation methods use
performance modeling or static workload simulation. These techniques are not
general: they requires significant human effort and computation capacity to
generate training data or a workload. It is also difficult to adapt ML systems
to use these techniques. This paper introduces, Phantora, a live GPU cluster
simulator for performance estimation. Phantora runs minimally modified ML
models and frameworks, intercepting and simulating GPU-related operations to
enable high-fidelity performance estimation. Phantora overcomes several
research challenges in integrating an event-driven network simulator with live
system execution, and introduces a set of techniques to improve simulation
speed, scalability, and accuracy. Our evaluation results show that Phantora can
deliver similar estimation accuracy to the state-of-the-art workload simulation
approach with only one GPU, while reducing human effort and increasing
generalizability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only
Transformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a
discrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial
output sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due
to the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of
all previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As
this iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,
layer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often
results in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and
reduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture
partitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular
intervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based
on instantaneous information about device resource availability and network
link bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices,
and in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum
of migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the
decoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its
key-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become
tight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit
parallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions
in inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5
devices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact
optimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable
improvements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
layer-based partitioning approaches.

Method: 采用控制屏障函数约束车辆的纵向和横向控制输入，并结合MARL训练换道控制器。

Result: 在模拟的匝道合并场景中，HSS能严格保证动态安全约束，零碰撞且交通效率与基线相当。

Conclusion: MARL-HSS方法在安全性和交通效率间取得了平衡，适用于不同交通密度场景。

Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with
safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular
communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this
issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines
optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies
control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs
of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to
integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while
ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that
simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities,
such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a
safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a
time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane
change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared
to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a
safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a
balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable
average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.

### [315] [Latent Variable Estimation in Bayesian Black-Litterman Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02185)
*Thomas Y. L. Lin,Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu,Paul W. Chiou,Peter Lin*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了贝叶斯Black-Litterman（BL）投资组合模型，消除了其对主观投资者观点的依赖，提出了一种完全数据驱动的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典BL模型需要投资者提供主观观点（如预测向量和不确定性矩阵），这限制了其应用。本文旨在通过数据学习这些参数，使模型更加客观和高效。

Method: 将投资者的观点视为潜在变量，通过市场数据学习这些变量，并提出了两种机制（共享潜在参数化和特征影响观点）来捕捉特征与回报的交互作用。

Result: 在30年道琼斯和20年行业ETF数据上，Sharpe比率提高了50%，换手率降低了55%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种完全数据驱动的BL框架，无需主观观点，且计算高效，为投资组合优化提供了更稳定的方法。

Abstract: We revisit the Bayesian Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio model and remove its
reliance on subjective investor views. Classical BL requires an investor
"view": a forecast vector $q$ and its uncertainty matrix $\Omega$ that describe
how much a chosen portfolio should outperform the market. Our key idea is to
treat $(q,\Omega)$ as latent variables and learn them from market data within a
single Bayesian network. Consequently, the resulting posterior estimation
admits closed-form expression, enabling fast inference and stable portfolio
weights. Building on these, we propose two mechanisms to capture how features
interact with returns: shared-latent parametrization and feature-influenced
views; both recover classical BL and Markowitz portfolios as special cases.
Empirically, on 30-year Dow-Jones and 20-year sector-ETF data, we improve
Sharpe ratios by 50% and cut turnover by 55% relative to Markowitz and the
index baselines. This work turns BL into a fully data-driven, view-free, and
coherent Bayesian framework for portfolio optimization.

### [316] [Bayesian Federated Cause-of-Death Classification and Quantification Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02257)
*Yu Zhu,Zehang Richard Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯联邦学习（BFL）的框架，用于在隐私和物流限制下分析口头尸检（VA）数据，避免数据共享，并在分布偏移情况下保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏医学认证死亡原因的地区，VA是关键工具，但现有算法因分布偏移和隐私问题难以集中训练。

Method: 采用贝叶斯联邦学习框架，无需共享数据，支持个体和群体级别的死亡原因分析。

Result: BFL在分布偏移情况下显著优于单域模型，性能与联合建模相当或更好。

Conclusion: BFL是一种高效、模块化的解决方案，适用于现实世界的死亡率监测系统。

Abstract: In regions lacking medically certified causes of death, verbal autopsy (VA)
is a critical and widely used tool to ascertain the cause of death through
interviews with caregivers. Data collected by VAs are often analyzed using
probabilistic algorithms. The performance of these algorithms often degrades
due to distributional shift across populations. Most existing VA algorithms
rely on centralized training, requiring full access to training data for joint
modeling. This is often infeasible due to privacy and logistical constraints.
In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework
that avoids data sharing across multiple training sources. Our method enables
reliable individual-level cause-of-death classification and population-level
quantification of cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), in a target
domain with limited or no local labeled data. The proposed framework is
modular, computationally efficient, and compatible with a wide range of
existing VA algorithms as candidate models, facilitating flexible deployment in
real-world mortality surveillance systems. We validate the performance of BFL
through extensive experiments on two real-world VA datasets under varying
levels of distribution shift. Our results show that BFL significantly
outperforms the base models built on a single domain and achieves comparable or
better performance compared to joint modeling.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的凸代理方法，用于近似连续可微函数，通过两阶段构建函数组合，优化了基于Poincaré不等式的损失函数，并在小训练集下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近似连续可微函数时，传统方法在最小化基于Poincaré不等式的损失函数时面临挑战，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段构建函数组合（f∘g），引入新的凸代理损失函数，并利用浓度不等式提供次优性结果。

Result: 新方法在小训练集和m=1时表现优于标准迭代方法，近似误差更小。

Conclusion: 提出的凸代理方法在优化Poincaré不等式损失函数时更高效，尤其适用于小训练集。

Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where
$g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we
build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$.
Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function
$\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving
evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$
may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex
surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide
sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and
a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on
different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our
approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training
Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation
errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$.

experiments across diverse pre-training configurations and code understanding
benchmarks, we demonstrate that BiGSCoder outperforms transformer-based models,
despite utilizing simpler pre-training strategies and much less training data.
Our results indicate that BiGSCoder can serve as a more sample-efficient
alternative to conventional transformer models. Furthermore, our study shows
that SSMs perform better without positional embeddings and can effectively
extrapolate to longer sequences during fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RADD的无人机异常检测方法，结合规则挖掘和无监督学习，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机依赖多传感器输入，故障可能导致安全问题。现有基于LSTM的方法存在泛化性、可解释性和领域知识捕获不足的问题。

Method: RADD结合规则挖掘（捕获传感器与执行器关系）和无监督学习（补充规则未覆盖的细微关系），在ArduPilot和Gazebo中实现。

Result: RADD检测到93.84%的异常，假阳性率仅2.33%，优于现有LSTM方法。

Conclusion: RADD是一种高效、可解释的无人机异常检测方法，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: UAVs, commonly referred to as drones, have witnessed a remarkable surge in
popularity due to their versatile applications. These cyber-physical systems
depend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers,
accelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical
instability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly
detection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of
identifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing
operators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection
methods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three
challenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse
mission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators
to understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing
domain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by
these challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly
detection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In
particular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships
between sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised
learning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have
missed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the
Gazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone
missions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models.
We find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies
over six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be
deployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a
state-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults
evaluated in our study.

Motivation: 解决基于场景测试在停止规则、残余风险估计、调试效果及仿真保真度对安全声明影响方面的根本问题。

Method: 通过与传统软件测试方法对比，提出量化场景失败概率（pfs）的模型，并评估测试效果。

Result: 研究发现基于场景和基于里程的测试各有优劣，提出REF指标以确保仿真测试结果的统计可靠性。

Conclusion: 强调严格的统计基础对AV安全验证的重要性，REF为仿真测试提供了统计支持。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles
(AVs) safety, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by
focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist
regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness,
and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that
a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and
enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and
traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps
and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the
probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness
under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor
mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce
Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of
synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety
claims are statistically defensible.

Abstract: Gas leakage poses a significant hazard that requires prevention.
Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and
labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning
techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality,
publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset, SimGas,
featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak

that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering,
and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that
our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on
background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation,
reaching an IoU of 69%. We also present an analysis of various prompt
configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the
performance of our method. Finally, we qualitatively (because of the lack of
ground truth) tested our performance on GasVid and reached decent results on

Abstract: Web-based educational videos offer flexible learning opportunities and are
becoming increasingly popular. However, improving user engagement and knowledge
retention remains a challenge. Automatically generated questions can activate
learners and support their knowledge acquisition. Further, they can help
teachers and learners assess their understanding. While large language and
vision-language models have been employed in various tasks, their application
to question generation for educational videos remains underexplored. In this
paper, we investigate the capabilities of current vision-language models for
generating learning-oriented questions for educational video content. We assess
(1) out-of-the-box models' performance; (2) fine-tuning effects on
content-specific question generation; (3) the impact of different video
modalities on question quality; and (4) in a qualitative study, question
relevance, answerability, and difficulty levels of generated questions. Our
findings delineate the capabilities of current vision-language models,
highlighting the need for fine-tuning and addressing challenges in question
diversity and relevance. We identify requirements for future multimodal
datasets and outline promising research directions.

Conclusion: 通过分析LVLMs的组件和开发新基准，为减少视觉对象幻觉提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in
multimodal tasks, but visual object hallucination remains a persistent issue.
It refers to scenarios where models generate inaccurate visual object-related
information based on the query input, potentially leading to misinformation and
concerns about safety and reliability. Previous works focus on the evaluation
and mitigation of visual hallucinations, but the underlying causes have not
been comprehensively investigated. In this paper, we analyze each component of
LLaVA-like LVLMs -- the large language model, the vision backbone, and the
projector -- to identify potential sources of error and their impact. Based on
our observations, we propose methods to mitigate hallucination for each
problematic component. Additionally, we developed two hallucination benchmarks:
QA-VisualGenome, which emphasizes attribute and relation hallucinations, and
QA-FB15k, which focuses on cognition-based hallucinations.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which
limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that
even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs.
This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control
over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by
employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust
CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data.
Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living

a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which
enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is
crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming
and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols,
resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information
extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a
transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset
is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric
Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials,
Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are
cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output.
Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and
category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently
outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving
higher precision (94.77% for GD&T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score
(97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves
accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in
precision-driven industries.

Conclusion: AOR框架显著提升了MLMMs的交互性和可解释性，为医学影像分析提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging examinations in
clinical settings. Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
enabled automated CXR interpretation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency. However, despite their strong visual understanding, current Medical
LMMs (MLMMs) still face two major challenges: (1) Insufficient region-level
understanding and interaction, and (2) Limited accuracy and interpretability
due to single-step reasoning. In this paper, we empower MLMMs with
anatomy-centric reasoning capabilities to enhance their interactivity and
explainability. Specifically, we first propose an Anatomical Ontology-Guided
Reasoning (AOR) framework, which centers on cross-modal region-level
information to facilitate multi-step reasoning. Next, under the guidance of
expert physicians, we develop AOR-Instruction, a large instruction dataset for
MLMMs training. Our experiments demonstrate AOR's superior performance in both
VQA and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: RL算法在优化MRMs方面具有潜力，StableReinforce算法为解决训练不稳定性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent
advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and
training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the
effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how
to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling.
Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL
task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such
as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even
collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this
issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training
loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods.
These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior
performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from
diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the
StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance
on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models,
R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$
improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference
compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the
potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.

TL;DR: TEMPURA是一个两阶段训练框架，通过掩码事件预测和因果推理增强视频时间理解，结合细粒度时间分割提升视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频时间分辨率和事件边界处理上存在不足，限制了因果依赖建模。

Method: TEMPURA采用两阶段训练：掩码事件预测推理和视频分割与密集描述生成。

Result: 在时间定位和高光检测基准测试中，TEMPURA优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合因果推理与细粒度时间分割可显著提升视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal
grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing
methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat
videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and
limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event
Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage
training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first
applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and
generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing
inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform
video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into
non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train
TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training
instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and
structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight
detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline
models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal
segmentation leads to improved video understanding.

*Yi-Ming Zhai,Chuan-Xian Ren,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种Soft-masked Semi-dual Optimal Transport (SSOT)方法，用于解决部分领域自适应(PDA)问题，通过估计类别权重和构建软掩码传输距离矩阵，优化领域间分布匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分领域自适应(PDA)中目标标签空间是源标签空间的子集，存在领域偏移和标签空间不一致的挑战。

Method: 通过估计类别权重重构源域，构建软掩码传输距离矩阵，利用半对偶最优传输和神经网络近似Kantorovich势函数。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了SSOT的有效性。

Conclusion: SSOT方法在PDA问题上表现优异，通过类条件分布匹配和神经网络优化实现了领域自适应。

Abstract: Visual domain adaptation aims to learn discriminative and domain-invariant
representation for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging knowledge from a
labeled source domain. Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a general and
practical scenario in which the target label space is a subset of the source
one. The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the
non-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual
Optimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem.
Specifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed
source domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting
class-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked
transport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will
enhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the
shared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the
semi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is
employed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a
neural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its
strong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the
generalization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input
distribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be
optimized alternately in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSOT.

Abstract: Manual scoring of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) for upper extremity
assessment in stroke rehabilitation is time-intensive and variable. We propose
an automated ARAT scoring system integrating multimodal video analysis with
SlowFast, I3D, and Transformer-based models using OpenPose keypoints and object
locations. Our approach employs multi-view data (ipsilateral, contralateral,
and top perspectives), applying early and late fusion to combine features
across views and models. Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement
quality components, enhancing interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays
task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. We conducted a study
with five clinicians who reviewed 500 video ratings generated by our system,
providing feedback on its accuracy and usability. Evaluated on a stroke
rehabilitation dataset, our framework achieves 89.0% validation accuracy with
late fusion, with HBMs aligning closely with manual assessments. This work
advances automated rehabilitation by offering a scalable, interpretable
solution with clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调大型视觉语言模型（如CLIP）时，往往忽略了潜在空间中的结构信息，导致预训练知识与任务特定适应之间的平衡不足。

Method: 采用拓扑感知的微调方法，结合RTD和交叉熵损失，显式对齐视觉和文本表示的拓扑结构，同时冻结基础VLM编码器，仅优化轻量级任务残差参数。

Result: 在6个基准数据集上，该方法在少样本设置中平均准确率提升了1-2%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入拓扑对齐，该研究提供了一种有效策略，增强了VLM的少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for
few-shot learning poses challenges in balancing pre-trained knowledge retention
and task-specific adaptation. Existing methods often overlook valuable
structural information within the VLM's latent space. We introduce a
topology-aware tuning approach integrating Representation Topology Divergence
(RTD) into the Task Residual (TR) framework. By explicitly aligning the
topological structures of visual and text representations using a combined RTD
and Cross-Entropy loss, while freezing base VLM encoders, our method enhances
few-shot performance. We optimize only lightweight Task Residual parameters,
effectively leveraging topological information. Across 6 diverse benchmark
datasets, our approach demonstrates significant gains, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 1-2\% over relevant baseline methods in few-shot
settings. This work presents an effective strategy to boost VLM few-shot
capabilities by incorporating topological alignment.

Conclusion: 人脸组件公平性可作为人口统计公平性的替代目标，为相关研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The widespread integration of face recognition technologies into various
applications (e.g., access control and personalized advertising) necessitates a
critical emphasis on fairness. While previous efforts have focused on
demographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components
remains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a
fairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our
work is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the
biological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in
optimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute
inter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation
from previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{N}etwork-informed \textbf{M}eta \textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which
incorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive
meta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of
our approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and
encodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above
challenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show
that BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation
baselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component
fairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g.,
\textit{gender}). Our findings pave the way for new research avenues on face
component fairness, suggesting that face component fairness could serve as a
potential surrogate objective for demographic fairness. The code for our work
is publicly
available~\footnote{https://github.com/yliuaa/BNMR-FairCompFace.git}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Llambda的新系统，旨在利用有限标注数据和大量未标注数据，通过对比学习和物理知识引导的标注方法，优化大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）对低分辨率视频的理解能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型主要针对高分辨率数据设计，难以有效理解低分辨率数据（如深度、热成像和红外数据），而传统标注方法成本高昂。

Method: 1. 提出对比导向数据标注器，通过对比学习生成高质量伪标签；2. 提出物理知识引导的标注器，利用时空一致性检查减少伪标签错误；3. 使用LoRA高效微调技术适配低分辨率数据。

Conclusion: Llambda通过结合对比学习和物理知识引导的标注方法，显著提升了LVLM对低分辨率视频的理解能力，且具备设备部署可行性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the
potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed
descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution
vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large
vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution
data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB
images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution
data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation
efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda,
designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited
labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating
informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively
fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we
propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture
behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate
high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second,
we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and
temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it
can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate
high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we
employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data.
We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct
low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms
several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模采集田间作物病害图像耗时耗力，生成模型提供了一种替代方案，但现有研究缺乏对农业领域计算需求的全面分析。

Method: 训练了三种Stable Diffusion变体（SDXL、SD3.5M、SD3.5L），并使用Dreambooth和LoRA微调技术提升泛化能力。

Result: SD3.5M表现最优，平均内存使用18 GB，功耗180 W，每500张图像能耗1.02 kWh（每张0.002 kWh），1.5小时内可从36张田间样本生成500张合成图像。

Conclusion: 推荐SD3.5M用于高效的作物病害数据生成。

Abstract: Collecting large-scale crop disease images in the field is labor-intensive
and time-consuming. Generative models (GMs) offer an alternative by creating
synthetic samples that resemble real-world images. However, existing research
primarily relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based image-to-image
translation and lack a comprehensive analysis of computational requirements in
agriculture. Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image
approach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to
provide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable
Diffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and
fine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning
techniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an
average memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use
of 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results
demonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36
in-field samples in 1.5 hours. We recommend SD3.5M for efficient crop disease
data generation.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate
state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a
novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power
of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation
actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed
chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically
adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages
several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models
such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the
MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation,
autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and
human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that
PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high
efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This
work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer

TL;DR: 论文提出VideoHallu基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在合成视频中检测异常内容的能力，并通过GRPO优化提升其推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成视频生成模型虽能生成高质量帧，但常违反常识和物理规律，而现有评估指标（如VideoScore）缺乏对此类问题的关注和解释性。

Method: 引入VideoHallu基准，包含专家设计的QA任务，评估多种MLLMs（如GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-Pro等）在合成视频中的表现，并采用GRPO方法进行微调。

Result: 实验显示，MLLMs在合成视频中仍存在幻觉问题，但通过GRPO优化和反例集成，显著提升了推理准确性。

Conclusion: VideoHallu基准揭示了MLLMs在合成视频中的局限性，优化方法为其推理能力提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Synthetic video generation with foundation models has gained attention for
its realism and wide applications. While these models produce high-quality
frames, they often fail to respect common sense and physical laws, resulting in
abnormal content. Existing metrics like VideoScore emphasize general quality
but ignore such violations and lack interpretability. A more insightful
approach is using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as interpretable
evaluators, as seen in FactScore. Yet, MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities
in synthetic videos remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce
VideoHallu, a benchmark featuring synthetic videos from models like Veo2, Sora,
and Kling, paired with expert-designed QA tasks solvable via human-level
reasoning across various categories. We assess several SoTA MLLMs, including
GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen-2.5-VL, and newer models like Video-R1 and
VideoChat-R1. Despite strong real-world performance on MVBench and MovieChat,
these models still hallucinate on basic commonsense and physics tasks in
synthetic settings, underscoring the challenge of hallucination. We further
fine-tune SoTA MLLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on real
and synthetic commonsense/physics data. Results show notable accuracy gains,
especially with counterexample integration, advancing MLLMs' reasoning
capabilities. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型仅基于RGB数据训练，无法直接用于RGB-T语义分割，而RGB-T在恶劣天气和光照条件下表现优越，因此需要定制化适配。

Method: 1. 通过添加LoRA层微调SAM；2. 引入语言信息指导训练；3. 设计跨模态知识蒸馏模块（CMKD）解决模态差异；4. 调整分割头并引入辅助语义分割头。

Result: 在MFNET、PST900和FMB三个基准测试中，SARTM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARTM成功将SAM适配于RGB-T分割，解决了跨模态问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates strong instance
segmentation performance across various downstream tasks. However, SAM is
trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal
(RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for
scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low
light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes
the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash
the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T
data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original
SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong
generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we
introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address
cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge
Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while
maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the
minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating
the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we
enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM
and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates
multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted
across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900,
and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate
that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across a variety of conditions.

Method: 采用任务无关的特征上采样模块，并在交互式分割任务中评估其效果。

Result: 实验表明，选择合适的特征上采样策略能显著提升VFMs特征的质量。

Conclusion: 特征上采样是提升VFMs在密集预测任务中表现的有效方法，交互式分割为评估提供了有力基准。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that
serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs'
popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their
effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce
low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context.
One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature
upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the
effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as
a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its
inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined
clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment
that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking
experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly
improves VFM features quality. The code is released at

Motivation: 现有方法在定制化文本到视频生成中忽视了身份与运动之间的相互约束和协同依赖，导致生成过程中出现冲突。

Method: DualReal包含两个单元：Dual-aware Adaptation动态选择训练阶段并避免知识泄漏；StageBlender Controller通过去噪阶段和Diffusion Transformer深度指导不同维度，实现无冲突融合。

Result: 实验表明，DualReal在CLIP-I和DINO-I指标上分别平均提升21.7%和31.8%，并在运动质量指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: DualReal通过协同构建身份与运动的依赖关系，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has
recently garnered significant attention through focusing on identity and motion
consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm,
where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively.
However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and
synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in
identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically
degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that,
employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies
between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1)
Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or
motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior,
and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2)
StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion
Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity,
avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion
of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark
than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves
CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top
performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.

fine-tune several open-source text-to-image models on this synthetic data. We
evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models by quantifying the alignment

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to enhance the cost-to-quality ratio of
image generation with diffusion models. We hypothesize that differences between
distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are
consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait
generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast
image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality
synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled
generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like
FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the
pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with
our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the
baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to
FLUX.1-dev. This study demonstrates the potential for improving the efficiency
of AI solutions involving large-scale image generation.

Result: 在六个基准数据集和三种学习范式上的实验表明，该方法相对现有最优方法提升了6.29%的准确性和平衡性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了伪标签不平衡问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks with pseudolabels
has gained increasing attention. A major obstacle is that the pseudolabels
generated by VLMs tend to be imbalanced, leading to inferior performance. While
existing methods have explored various strategies to address this, the
underlying causes of imbalance remain insufficiently investigated. To fill this
gap, we delve into imbalanced pseudolabels and identify two primary
contributing factors: concept mismatch and concept confusion. To mitigate these
two issues, we propose a novel framework incorporating concept alignment and
confusion-aware calibrated margin mechanisms. The core of our approach lies in
enhancing underperforming classes and promoting balanced predictions across
categories, thus mitigating imbalance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark
datasets with three learning paradigms demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively enhances the accuracy and balance of pseudolabels, achieving a
relative improvement of 6.29% over the SoTA method. Our code is avaliable at

TL;DR: COCA-Net是一种基于注意力机制的层次化网络，用于无监督对象发现任务，通过紧凑性聚类算法提取对象中心表示，并在多个数据集上表现优异。

Motivation: 解决单图像中无监督对象发现任务，提升对象中心表示学习的效率和效果。

Method: 提出紧凑聚类注意力（COCA）层，结合层次化网络架构（COCA-Net），利用紧凑性聚类算法提取对象中心表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，优于或与现有最佳模型竞争。

Conclusion: COCA-Net通过紧凑性聚类和层次化设计，显著提升了无监督对象分割的性能。

Abstract: We propose the Compact Clustering Attention (COCA) layer, an effective
building block that introduces a hierarchical strategy for object-centric
representation learning, while solving the unsupervised object discovery task
on single images. COCA is an attention-based clustering module capable of
extracting object-centric representations from multi-object scenes, when
cascaded into a bottom-up hierarchical network architecture, referred to as
COCA-Net. At its core, COCA utilizes a novel clustering algorithm that
leverages the physical concept of compactness, to highlight distinct object
centroids in a scene, providing a spatial inductive bias. Thanks to this
strategy, COCA-Net generates high-quality segmentation masks on both the
decoder side and, notably, the encoder side of its pipeline. Additionally,
COCA-Net is not bound by a predetermined number of object masks that it
generates and handles the segmentation of background elements better than its
competitors. We demonstrate COCA-Net's segmentation performance on six widely
adopted datasets, achieving superior or competitive results against the
state-of-the-art models across nine different evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过构建更有效的编辑指令来解决现有图像编辑数据集中噪声监督信号问题的新方法，包括修正指令和对指令进行对比增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集由于自动化方法构建导致编辑指令与图像对不匹配，产生噪声监督信号，现有方法未能解决这一根本问题。

Method: 通过分析编辑模型在不同推理步骤中的生成属性，定义统一指导修正指令，并引入对比监督信号（正负指令）和三重损失增强监督效果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，例如在Real-Edit基准上比SOTA SmartEdit提升9.19%，且训练数据减少30倍，模型规模缩小13倍。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖VLM模块或预训练任务，提供了一种更直接高效的监督信号解决方案，为基于指令的图像编辑提供了新颖、简单且有效的方法。

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing
datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to
noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions
and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing
models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on
recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to
resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by
constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This
includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the
original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to
further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models
exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,
independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified
guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some
challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified
instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals
with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model
training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision
effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training
tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to
provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and
effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19%
improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x
smaller model size.

Motivation: 现有3D场景数据集依赖人工设计，难以规模化且成本高，需要一种自动化方法来生成高质量、多样化的3D场景以支持EAI研究。

Method: 1. 构建MetaScenes数据集，包含15366个对象和831个细粒度类别；2. 提出Scan2Sim模型，实现资产自动替换；3. 设计两个基准测试评估数据集。

Conclusion: MetaScenes和Scan2Sim为EAI研究提供了可扩展的解决方案，展示了自动化生成3D场景的潜力。

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to
effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and
generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the
precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets
demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which
demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges.
To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present
MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from
real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained
categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model,
which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby
eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We
further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene
synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a
domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate
cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by
supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications,
introducing new possibilities for EAI research. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖手动调整或穷举搜索，计算成本高且无法保证最优结果，需要一种更高效的方法来确定融合时机。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态深度学习提供了高效、鲁棒的融合优化框架，有望提升临床决策和医学AI的可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning harnesses diverse imaging modalities, such as MRI
sequences, to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. A key challenge
is determining the optimal timing for integrating these
modalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules
should be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or
exhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of
converging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm
that incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at
different layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains
from previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the
best-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search
space, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without
exhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated
on two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks.
Our algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal
baselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion
placements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and
specificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore,
the sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational
overhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically
determining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances
multimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and
robust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical
decision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI
applications.

TL;DR: Corr2Distrib是一种基于对应关系的方法，首次通过RGB图像估计6D相机姿态分布，解决视觉模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性和遮挡导致视觉模糊性，产生多个有效姿态，现有方法未充分利用局部对应关系。

Method: Corr2Distrib学习对称感知的3D点表示，生成旋转假设，并通过PnP和姿态评分优化为6D姿态分布。

Result: 在复杂非合成场景中，Corr2Distrib在姿态分布估计和单姿态估计上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Corr2Distrib展示了基于对应关系方法的潜力，成功将视觉模糊性转化为优势。

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which
estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the
observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities,
leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this
problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP
Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose
solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not
straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities
drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these
ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first
learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's
surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation
enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D
correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution
using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex
non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art
solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from
an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对文本到图像扩散模型（T2I）的版权规避攻击（CEAT2I），旨在绕过数据集所有权验证（DOV）的水印机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练模型的个性化微调趋势增长，未经授权的数据集使用问题日益严重。DOV通过水印技术保护数据集所有权，但其对版权规避攻击（CEA）的鲁棒性尚未被研究。

Method: CEAT2I分为三个阶段：水印样本检测、触发词识别和高效水印消除。利用T2I模型在水印样本上收敛更快的特点，通过中间特征偏差检测水印样本，并通过迭代消融提示词识别触发词，最后采用闭式概念擦除方法去除水印。

Result: 实验表明，CEAT2I能有效规避DOV机制，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了DOV机制的潜在漏洞，为未来更鲁棒的水印技术提供了参考。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling
high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the
growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises
serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset
ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks
into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks
remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when
triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness
against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models
to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose
the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to
undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three
stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient
watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models
exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,
evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can
reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens
from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in
intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a
closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive
experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while
preserving model performance.

Abstract: Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural
networks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational
complexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors
that connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear
accumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by
this, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric
field-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric
nonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing
the transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched
architecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware
integration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated
device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks
incorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison
to much larger networks without dendrites ($\sim$17$\times$ fewer trainable
weight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can
significantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of
neuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.

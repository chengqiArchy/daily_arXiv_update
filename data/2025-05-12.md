### [1] [KG-HTC: Integrating Knowledge Graphs into LLMs for Effective Zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05583)
*Qianbo Zang,Christophe Zgrzendek,Igor Tchappi,Afshin Khadangi,Johannes Sedlmeir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-HTC结合知识图谱与大型语言模型，通过检索增强生成方法解决层次化文本分类中的零样本问题，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中缺乏标注数据，层次化文本分类面临大标签空间和长尾分布问题。

Method: 利用知识图谱为输入文本检索相关子图，结合大型语言模型增强标签语义理解。

Result: 在三个开源数据集上显著优于基线方法，尤其在深层层次上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结合结构化知识能有效解决层次化文本分类的挑战。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) involves assigning documents to labels
organized within a taxonomy. Most previous research on HTC has focused on
supervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC
can be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces
issues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we
present Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification
(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by
integrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide
structured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves
relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to
understand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on
three open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental
results show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the
strict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at
deeper levels of the hierarchy. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of incorporating structured knowledge into LLMs to address HTC's challenges in
large label spaces and long-tailed label distributions. Our code is available

### [2] [Privacy-Preserving Transformers: SwiftKey's Differential Privacy Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05648)
*Abdelrahman Abouelenin,Mohamed Abdelrehim,Raffy Fahim,Amr Hendy,Mohamed Afify*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过差分隐私（DP）训练了一个Transformer用于SwiftKey的语言建模，平衡了模型大小、运行速度和准确性，取得了比生产GRU更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在保护隐私的同时，优化语言模型的性能，特别是在移动设备上的应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在通用数据上训练种子模型，再用DP微调打字数据；同时缩小GPT2架构以适应需求。

Result: 在下一个词预测和准确性上取得小幅但一致的提升，同时内存和速度增加可控。

Conclusion: 通过DP和两阶段训练，成功实现了高效且隐私保护的语言模型，适用于SwiftKey等移动应用。

Abstract: In this paper we train a transformer using differential privacy (DP) for
language modeling in SwiftKey. We run multiple experiments to balance the
trade-off between the model size, run-time speed and accuracy. We show that we
get small and consistent gains in the next-word-prediction and accuracy with
graceful increase in memory and speed compared to the production GRU. This is
obtained by scaling down a GPT2 architecture to fit the required size and a two
stage training process that builds a seed model on general data and DP
finetunes it on typing data. The transformer is integrated using ONNX offering
both flexibility and efficiency.

### [3] [Exploration of COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter: American Politician Edition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05687)
*Cindy Kim,Daniela Puchall,Jiangyi Liang,Jiwon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了美国两党在COVID-19疫情中的立场差异，通过分析推文内容发现民主党更关注疫情伤亡和医疗建议，而共和党更注重政治责任和媒体更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨COVID-19疫情对政治立场的影响，分析两党在应对疫情时的不同态度和策略。

Method: 使用词袋模型、双词模型和TF-IDF模型分析推文关键词、主题和情感，并利用分类算法预测推文的政治立场。

Result: 民主党更关注疫情伤亡和医疗建议，共和党更注重政治责任和媒体更新。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于语言模型的分类方法，可预测推文的政治立场。

Abstract: The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected the political
scene worldwide and the introduction of new terminology and public opinions
regarding the virus has further polarized partisan stances. Using a collection
of tweets gathered from leading American political figures online (Republican
and Democratic), we explored the partisan differences in approach, response,
and attitude towards handling the international crisis. Implementation of the
bag-of-words, bigram, and TF-IDF models was used to identify and analyze
keywords, topics, and overall sentiments from each party. Results suggest that
Democrats are more concerned with the casualties of the pandemic, and give more
medical precautions and recommendations to the public whereas Republicans are
more invested in political responsibilities such as keeping the public updated
through media and carefully watching the progress of the virus. We propose a
systematic approach to predict and distinguish a tweet's political stance (left
or right leaning) based on its COVID-19 related terms using different
classification algorithms on different language models.

### [4] [Assessing Robustness to Spurious Correlations in Post-Training Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05704)
*Julia Shuieh,Prasann Singhal,Apaar Shanker,John Heyer,George Pu,Samuel Denton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了三种后训练算法（SFT、DPO、KTO）在不同任务和虚假相关性条件下的表现，发现不同算法在不同任务和虚假相关性下表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实训练数据中存在的虚假相关性可能影响模型性能，需要评估不同后训练算法在应对这些相关性时的表现。

Method: 在数学推理、指令遵循和文档问答等任务中，比较SFT、DPO和KTO在不同虚假相关性条件下的表现。

Result: 偏好优化方法（DPO/KTO）在数学推理任务中表现稳健，而SFT在复杂任务中表现更强。

Conclusion: 后训练算法的选择取决于任务类型和虚假相关性的性质，没有单一最优方法。

Abstract: Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness
criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious
correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut"
features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms --
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO
(Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and
spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained
instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the
degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of
artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results
show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness.
The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in
mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance
in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single
post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best
choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious
correlations.

### [5] [TopicVD: A Topic-Based Dataset of Video-Guided Multimodal Machine Translation for Documentaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05714)
*Jinze Lv,Jian Chen,Zi Long,Xianghua Fu,Yin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopicVD是一个基于主题的视频数据集，用于支持纪录片的多模态机器翻译研究，填补了现有数据集在视频数据多样性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMT数据集多为静态图像或短视频，无法满足纪录片翻译等实际需求。

Method: 收集纪录片视频-字幕对，按主题分类，提出基于跨模态双向注意力模块的MMT模型。

Result: 视觉信息提升翻译性能，但跨领域性能显著下降；全局上下文有效改善翻译效果。

Conclusion: TopicVD推动了视频支持的MMT研究，需进一步研究领域适应方法。

Abstract: Most existing multimodal machine translation (MMT) datasets are predominantly
composed of static images or short video clips, lacking extensive video data
across diverse domains and topics. As a result, they fail to meet the demands
of real-world MMT tasks, such as documentary translation. In this study, we
developed TopicVD, a topic-based dataset for video-supported multimodal machine
translation of documentaries, aiming to advance research in this field. We
collected video-subtitle pairs from documentaries and categorized them into
eight topics, such as economy and nature, to facilitate research on domain
adaptation in video-guided MMT. Additionally, we preserved their contextual
information to support research on leveraging the global context of
documentaries in video-guided MMT. To better capture the shared semantics
between text and video, we propose an MMT model based on a cross-modal
bidirectional attention module. Extensive experiments on the TopicVD dataset
demonstrate that visual information consistently improves the performance of
the NMT model in documentary translation. However, the MMT model's performance
significantly declines in out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for
effective domain adaptation methods. Additionally, experiments demonstrate that
global context can effectively improve translation performance. % Dataset and
our implementations are available at https://github.com/JinzeLv/TopicVD

### [6] [Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05755)
*Dhruvesh Patel,Aishwarya Sahoo,Avinash Amballa,Tahira Naseem,Tim G. J. Rudner,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 插入语言模型（ILMs）通过任意位置插入令牌解决了自回归模型（ARMs）和掩码扩散模型（MDMs）的局限性，在规划任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARMs和MDMs在处理复杂约束或非顺序依赖的序列时存在不足，需要一种更灵活的生成方法。

Method: 提出ILMs，通过联合选择插入位置和词汇元素，并采用简单的去噪目标进行训练。

Result: ILMs在规划任务中优于ARMs和MDMs，在无条件文本生成任务中与ARMs相当，同时在任意长度文本填充中更灵活。

Conclusion: ILMs为序列生成任务提供了一种更灵活且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one
``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range
of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent
sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential
dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion
Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking
multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs
cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be
filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion
Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in
a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary
element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent
strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in
arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token
dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs,
we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising
objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs
and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform
MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task
while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text
infilling.

### [7] [Sparse Attention Remapping with Clustering for Efficient LLM Decoding on PIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05772)
*Zehao Fan,Garrett Gagnon,Zhenyu Liu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARC是一种针对PIM架构优化的稀疏数据映射方案，通过语义相似性聚类KV对并映射到连续内存区域，显著减少LLM解码时的延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自回归解码时因KV缓存的内存访问压力导致带宽瓶颈，现有PIM架构对稀疏KV缓存的支持不足。

Method: STARC通过语义聚类KV对并映射到PIM内存结构，利用预计算中心点实现选择性注意力和并行处理。

Result: 实验显示STARC在HBM-PIM系统上减少注意力层延迟19%-31%，能耗19%-27%，并在KV缓存预算下进一步优化。

Conclusion: STARC在保持模型精度的同时，显著提升PIM架构上长上下文LLM推理的效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but
their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language
models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent
memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in
memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory
(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth
and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily
optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access
patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they
suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization.
In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme
tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC
clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory
regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve
relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed
centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without
frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM
system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces
attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a
KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and
45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC
maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and
hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.

*Machi Shimmei,Masaki Uto,Yuichiroh Matsubayashi,Kentaro Inui,Aditi Mallavarapu,Noboru Matsuda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AnaQuest是一种创新的提示技术，用于通过预训练大语言模型生成多选题（MCQs），其选项为复杂概念的句子级断言。结合形成性和总结性评估，AnaQuest生成的题目在专家评分和IRT分析中表现优于ChatGPT，更接近人工题目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够生成高质量多选题的技术，结合形成性和总结性评估，提升自动化评估的有效性。

Method: AnaQuest技术通过分析学生对开放问题的回答生成正确和错误的断言，形成多选题。使用IRT比较AnaQuest、ChatGPT和人工题目的特性。

Result: 专家认为AnaQuest和ChatGPT生成的题目与人工题目同样有效，但IRT分析显示AnaQuest生成的题目（尤其是错误选项）在难度和区分度上更接近人工题目。

Conclusion: AnaQuest是一种有效的多选题生成技术，其生成的题目在质量上接近人工题目，优于ChatGPT生成的题目。

Abstract: The primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative
prompting technique, AnaQuest, for generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
using a pre-trained large language model. In AnaQuest, the choice items are
sentence-level assertions about complex concepts. The technique integrates
formative and summative assessments. In the formative phase, students answer
open-ended questions for target concepts in free text. For summative
assessment, AnaQuest analyzes these responses to generate both correct and
incorrect assertions. To evaluate the validity of the generated MCQs, Item
Response Theory (IRT) was applied to compare item characteristics between MCQs
generated by AnaQuest, a baseline ChatGPT prompt, and human-crafted items. An
empirical study found that expert instructors rated MCQs generated by both AI
models to be as valid as those created by human instructors. However, IRT-based
analysis revealed that AnaQuest-generated questions - particularly those with
incorrect assertions (foils) - more closely resembled human-crafted items in
terms of difficulty and discrimination than those produced by ChatGPT.

### [9] [Symbol-based entity marker highlighting for enhanced text mining in materials science with generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05864)
*Junhyeong Lee,Jong Min Yuk,Chan-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的混合文本挖掘框架，结合多步和直接方法的优势，将非结构化科学文本转化为结构化数据，并通过实体标记技术提升实体识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（多步和直接方法）在独立应用时存在局限性，需要一种结合两者优势的方法来更高效地从科学文献中提取结构化数据。

Method: 提出混合框架，先将原始文本转化为实体识别文本，再转化为结构化形式，并引入实体标记技术提升识别性能。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（MatScholar、SOFC和SOFC slot NER）上，实体识别性能优于现有方法，实体级F1分数提升58%，关系级F1分数提升83%。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了多步和直接方法的优势，显著提升了实体识别和结构化数据的质量。

Abstract: The construction of experimental datasets is essential for expanding the
scope of data-driven scientific discovery. Recent advances in natural language
processing (NLP) have facilitated automatic extraction of structured data from
unstructured scientific literature. While existing approaches-multi-step and
direct methods-offer valuable capabilities, they also come with limitations
when applied independently. Here, we propose a novel hybrid text-mining
framework that integrates the advantages of both methods to convert
unstructured scientific text into structured data. Our approach first
transforms raw text into entity-recognized text, and subsequently into
structured form. Furthermore, beyond the overall data structuring framework, we
also enhance entity recognition performance by introducing an entity marker-a
simple yet effective technique that uses symbolic annotations to highlight
target entities. Specifically, our entity marker-based hybrid approach not only
consistently outperforms previous entity recognition approaches across three
benchmark datasets (MatScholar, SOFC, and SOFC slot NER) but also improve the
quality of final structured data-yielding up to a 58% improvement in
entity-level F1 score and up to 83% improvement in relation-level F1 score
compared to direct approach.

*Vytenis Šliogeris,Povilas Daniušis,Artūras Nakvosas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 实验研究了在Gemma2 20亿参数大语言模型（LLM）上使用弹性权重巩固（EWC）进行自回归预训练，重点关注立陶宛语数据的持续学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过EWC减轻大语言模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并验证其对新任务学习的潜在益处。

Method: 在Gemma2模型上应用EWC，使用CulturaX数据集中10%的立陶宛语部分进行预训练，并评估语言理解和困惑度基准。

Result: 实证表明，EWC不仅能缓解灾难性遗忘，还可能对新任务学习有积极影响。

Conclusion: EWC在大语言模型的持续学习中具有潜力，既能防止遗忘，又能促进新任务学习。

Abstract: This technical report describes an experiment on autoregressive pre-training
of Gemma2 2 billion parameter large language model (LLM) with 10\% on the
Lithuanian language component of CulturaX from the point of view of continual
learning. We apply elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to the full set of the
model's parameters and investigate language understanding benchmarks,
consisting of Arc, Belebele, Gsm8K, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande
sets (both in English and Lithuanian versions), and perplexity benchmarks. We
empirically demonstrate that EWC regularisation allows us not only to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting effects but also that it is potentially beneficial for
learning of the new task with LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过微调解码器大语言模型自动生成德国判决摘要的方法，并引入法律实体信息提升效果，但生成的摘要质量尚不足以实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为法律专家提供自动化工具，辅助处理冗长法律文件。

Method: 微调解码器大语言模型，并在训练前为判决添加法律实体信息。

Result: 使用法律实体信息有助于模型找到相关内容，但生成的摘要质量未达实际应用标准。

Conclusion: 当前方法虽有效，但需进一步改进以提升摘要质量。

Abstract: The automated summarisation of long legal documents can be a great aid for
legal experts in their daily work. We automatically create summaries (guiding
principles) of German judgments by fine-tuning a decoder-based large language
model. We enrich the judgments with information about legal entities before the
training. For the evaluation of the created summaries, we define a set of
evaluation classes which allows us to measure their language, pertinence,
completeness and correctness. Our results show that employing legal entities
helps the generative model to find the relevant content, but the quality of the
created summaries is not yet sufficient for a use in practice.

### [12] [NeoQA: Evidence-based Question Answering with Generated News Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05949)
*Max Glockner,Xiang Jiang,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Iryna Gurevych,Markus Dreyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeoQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强生成（RAG）中的表现，通过虚构新闻事件和实体避免模型依赖预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试容易过时，难以区分模型是基于检索证据还是预训练知识回答问题。

Method: 构建虚构新闻事件的时间线和知识库，生成问答对，确保模型只能依赖检索证据回答问题。

Result: LLMs在问题与证据间细微不匹配时表现不佳，且在关键信息缺失时倾向于捷径推理。

Conclusion: NeoQA揭示了LLMs在证据推理中的关键局限性，为评估证据问答提供了新平台。

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models
(LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions
initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge
as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making
it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce
NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark
designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and
knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles
and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring
that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as
a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires
LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when
sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across
various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details.
Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches
between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key
information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence,
underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.

*Lennart Stöpler,Rufat Asadli,Mitja Nikolaus,Ryan Cotterell,Alex Warstadt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于交互式语言学习的训练方法，模拟儿童语言习得过程，通过单轮对话中的奖励机制优化语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受儿童语言习得启发，探索交互式学习对语言模型训练的影响，尤其是通过奖励信号间接评估语法正确性。

Method: 采用强化学习在语言问答任务中微调语言模型，通过通信信道约束观察行为变化。

Result: 实验表明通信约束能改变说话者行为，但未在语言评估中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 未来可通过改进任务设计和训练配置，进一步验证交互学习对语言模型认知能力的提升作用。

Abstract: We propose a method for training language models in an interactive setting
inspired by child language acquisition. In our setting, a speaker attempts to
communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and
receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related
work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we
operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only
question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study
demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality.
Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune
language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the
communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior.
However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our
training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and
training configuration that could better position future work to use our
methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in
computational cognitive models.

*M. Maziyah Mohamed,R. H. Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语义透明度的嵌入度量方法及其对阅读的影响，通过聚类分析和线性判别分析验证了其对词汇决策时间的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义透明度对词汇识别至关重要，但其计算方法尚未明确，研究旨在探索基于嵌入的语义透明度度量及其在阅读中的作用。

Method: 对4,226个马来语前缀词进行t-SNE聚类分析，并利用线性判别分析和广义加性混合模型评估五种简单度量对词汇决策时间的预测能力。

Result: 所有度量均能预测词汇决策时间，其中词与聚类中心的相关性度量表现最佳。

Conclusion: 嵌入度量方法能有效量化语义透明度，并显著影响词汇识别过程。

Abstract: Studies of morphological processing have shown that semantic transparency is
crucial for word recognition. Its computational operationalization is still
under discussion. Our primary objectives are to explore embedding-based
measures of semantic transparency, and assess their impact on reading. First,
we explored the geometry of complex words in semantic space. To do so, we
conducted a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering analysis on
4,226 Malay prefixed words. Several clusters were observed for complex words
varied by their prefix class. Then, we derived five simple measures, and
investigated whether they were significant predictors of lexical decision
latencies. Two sets of Linear Discriminant Analyses were run in which the
prefix of a word is predicted from either word embeddings or shift vectors
(i.e., a vector subtraction of the base word from the derived word). The
accuracy with which the model predicts the prefix of a word indicates the
degree of transparency of the prefix. Three further measures were obtained by
comparing embeddings between each word and all other words containing the same
prefix (i.e., centroid), between each word and the shift from their base word,
and between each word and the predicted word of the Functional Representations
of Affixes in Compositional Semantic Space model. In a series of Generalized
Additive Mixed Models, all measures predicted decision latencies after
accounting for word frequency, word length, and morphological family size. The
model that included the correlation between each word and their centroid as a
predictor provided the best fit to the data.

Motivation: 探索多语言语法纠错模型的性能，以推荐适用于多语言任务的模型。

Method: 使用17个模型对四种语言的文本进行语法纠错，分析其输出，重点关注减少语法错误并保持最小改动。

Result: 六种模型在所有四种语言中均能提升语法正确性，其中Gemma 9B表现最佳。

Conclusion: Gemma 9B是目前在英语、德语、意大利语和瑞典语中语法纠错性能最优的模型。

Abstract: Recent language models can successfully solve various language-related tasks,
and many understand inputs stated in different languages. In this paper, we
explore the performance of 17 popular models used to correct grammatical issues
in texts stated in English, German, Italian, and Swedish when using a single
model to correct texts in all those languages. We analyze the outputs generated
by these models, focusing on decreasing the number of grammatical errors while
keeping the changes small. The conclusions drawn help us understand what
problems occur among those models and which models can be recommended for
multilingual grammatical error correction tasks. We list six models that
improve grammatical correctness in all four languages and show that Gemma 9B is
currently the best performing one for the languages considered.

Motivation: 当前机器翻译模型在大多数场景下表现良好，但在保留特定实体（如URL、IBAN号码、电子邮件）方面仍存在问题，需要进一步研究和改进。

Method: 研究了多个流行NMT模型（如OPUS项目、Google Translate、MADLAD、EuroLLM）在四种语言（英语、德语、波兰语、乌克兰语）中保留实体的能力，分析了其准确性和错误原因。

Result: 研究发现某些类别（如表情符号）对许多模型构成显著挑战，同时提出了一个包含36,000句子的多语言合成数据集，用于评估实体传递质量。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了机器翻译模型在保留实体方面的局限性，并提出新数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Current machine translation models provide us with high-quality outputs in
most scenarios. However, they still face some specific problems, such as
detecting which entities should not be changed during translation. In this
paper, we explore the abilities of popular NMT models, including models from
the OPUS project, Google Translate, MADLAD, and EuroLLM, to preserve entities
such as URL addresses, IBAN numbers, or emails when producing translations
between four languages: English, German, Polish, and Ukrainian. We investigate
the quality of popular NMT models in terms of accuracy, discuss errors made by
the models, and examine the reasons for errors. Our analysis highlights
specific categories, such as emojis, that pose significant challenges for many
models considered. In addition to the analysis, we propose a new multilingual
synthetic dataset of 36,000 sentences that can help assess the quality of
entity transfer across nine categories and four aforementioned languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unilogit是一种新型的自蒸馏方法，用于大型语言模型的机器遗忘，动态调整目标logits以实现目标token的均匀概率，无需额外超参数，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在遵守GDPR等数据隐私法规时，选择性遗忘特定信息同时保持模型整体效用的挑战。

Method: 动态调整目标logits，利用当前模型输出生成更准确的自蒸馏目标，避免静态超参数或初始模型输出的依赖。

Result: 在公开基准和内部电商数据集上，Unilogit在平衡遗忘与保留目标方面表现优异，优于NPO和UnDIAL等方法。

Conclusion: Unilogit具有鲁棒性和实用性，能有效实现机器遗忘。

Abstract: This paper introduces Unilogit, a novel self-distillation method for machine
unlearning in Large Language Models. Unilogit addresses the challenge of
selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model
utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.
Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model
outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform
probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for
more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the
need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to
approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and
an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit's superior performance in
balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit's robustness
across various scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and
effectiveness in achieving efficacious machine unlearning.

*Joshua Harris,Fan Grayson,Felix Feldman,Timothy Laurence,Toby Nonnenmacher,Oliver Higgins,Leo Loman,Selina Patel,Thomas Finnie,Samuel Collins,Michael Borowitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PubHealthBench，一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在英国政府公共卫生信息领域知识的基准测试，包含8000多个问题。研究发现，最新的私有LLMs在多项选择题中表现优异（>90%），但在自由回答中表现较差（<75%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，了解其在特定领域（如公共卫生）的知识对实际应用至关重要。目前缺乏对LLMs在英国政府公共卫生信息中知识的研究。

Method: 通过自动化流程创建PubHealthBench，包含8000多个问题，评估24个LLMs在多项选择题和自由回答中的表现。

Result: 私有LLMs在多项选择题中表现优异（>90%），优于人类；但在自由回答中表现较差（<75%）。

Conclusion: 尽管SOTA LLMs在公共卫生信息中表现良好，但在自由回答中仍需额外保障措施。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed
understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for
successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health,
where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could
significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM
knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue,
this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions
for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form
responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also
release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance
documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on
PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a
high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform
humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see
lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are
promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate
source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still
be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

*Iuliia Zaitova,Vitalii Hirak,Badr M. Abdullah,Dietrich Klakow,Bernd Möbius,Tania Avgustinova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了基于BERT架构的编码器模型对多词表达（MWEs）的注意力模式，发现微调显著影响模型对MWEs的注意力分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨微调BERT模型对语义和句法任务中MWEs（习语和微句法单元）注意力模式的影响。

Method: 使用六种印欧语言的单语模型和数据集，比较预训练和微调模型对MWEs的注意力分数。

Result: 语义任务微调模型对习语的注意力更均匀；句法任务微调模型在底层对微句法单元的注意力增加。

Conclusion: 微调任务类型显著影响模型对MWEs的注意力分配，语义和句法任务表现出不同的注意力模式。

Abstract: This study analyzes the attention patterns of fine-tuned encoder-only models
based on the BERT architecture (BERT-based models) towards two distinct types
of Multiword Expressions (MWEs): idioms and microsyntactic units (MSUs). Idioms
present challenges in semantic non-compositionality, whereas MSUs demonstrate
unconventional syntactic behavior that does not conform to standard grammatical
categorizations. We aim to understand whether fine-tuning BERT-based models on
specific tasks influences their attention to MWEs, and how this attention
differs between semantic and syntactic tasks. We examine attention scores to
MWEs in both pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT-based models. We utilize
monolingual models and datasets in six Indo-European languages - English,
German, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. Our results show that
fine-tuning significantly influences how models allocate attention to MWEs.
Specifically, models fine-tuned on semantic tasks tend to distribute attention
to idiomatic expressions more evenly across layers. Models fine-tuned on
syntactic tasks show an increase in attention to MSUs in the lower layers,
corresponding with syntactic processing requirements.

TL;DR: 该论文使用基于Transformer的早期融合方法，结合文本、音频和视觉模态进行多模态情感分析，在CMU-MOSEI数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态情感分析中早期融合策略的有效性，利用Transformer架构捕捉跨模态交互。

Method: 采用BERT编码器分别处理文本、音频和视觉模态，通过早期融合（拼接嵌入）进行分类，使用Adam优化器、dropout和早停策略。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到97.87%的7分类准确率和0.9682的F1分数，MAE为0.1060，表明情感强度预测精确。

Conclusion: 早期融合的Transformer架构在多模态情感分析中表现优越，未来可比较融合策略或提升可解释性。

Abstract: This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI
dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text,
audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality,
extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model
achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682
F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in
capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization
(lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and
robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in
modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise
sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or
enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by
effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment
analysis.

### [21] [LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120)
*Philippe Laban,Hiroaki Hayashi,Yingbo Zhou,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在单轮和多轮对话中的性能差异，发现多轮对话中性能平均下降39%，主要原因是模型在早期做出假设并过早生成解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在用户指令中经常出现不完整描述的情况，但现有评估主要关注单轮、完整指令场景，因此需要研究多轮对话中的性能表现。

Method: 通过大规模模拟实验，比较了多个顶级开源和闭源LLMs在单轮和多轮对话中的性能，分析了20万+模拟对话。

Result: 多轮对话中LLMs性能显著下降39%，性能损失主要源于模型在早期做出假设并过早生成解决方案，导致后续对话难以纠正。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮对话中容易因早期错误假设而迷失方向，需改进模型在多轮交互中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs
have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify
the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they
need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM
conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in
user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,
fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale
simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn
settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs
we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations
than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.
Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance
degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant
increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early
turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly
rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a
conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.

*Xu Han,Yumeng Sun,Weiqiang Huang,Hongye Zheng,Junliang Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自适应微调、对比学习和正则化优化的策略，以提升Transformer模型在少样本文本分类中的性能。实验表明，该方法在FewRel 2.0数据集上表现优异，尤其在5-shot任务中能更有效地捕捉文本特征并提高分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本文本分类在低资源环境中具有重要应用价值，但传统方法在语义模糊或特征复杂的类别上表现不佳。

Method: 结合自适应微调、对比学习和正则化优化，引入对比损失和正则化损失以增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在FewRel 2.0数据集上，T5-small、DeBERTa-v3和RoBERTa-base表现优异，尤其在5-shot任务中分类准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入对比损失和正则化损失，模型泛化能力增强，有效缓解少样本环境中的过拟合问题。使用更强自注意力机制的Transformer模型或生成架构可进一步提升分类稳定性与准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot text classification has important application value in low-resource
environments. This paper proposes a strategy that combines adaptive
fine-tuning, contrastive learning, and regularization optimization to improve
the classification performance of Transformer-based models. Experiments on the
FewRel 2.0 dataset show that T5-small, DeBERTa-v3, and RoBERTa-base perform
well in few-shot tasks, especially in the 5-shot setting, which can more
effectively capture text features and improve classification accuracy. The
experiment also found that there are significant differences in the
classification difficulty of different relationship categories. Some categories
have fuzzy semantic boundaries or complex feature distributions, making it
difficult for the standard cross entropy loss to learn the discriminative
information required to distinguish categories. By introducing contrastive loss
and regularization loss, the generalization ability of the model is enhanced,
effectively alleviating the overfitting problem in few-shot environments. In
addition, the research results show that the use of Transformer models or
generative architectures with stronger self-attention mechanisms can help
improve the stability and accuracy of few-shot classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了多语言大语言模型（如LLaMA、Aya等）在零样本和少样本提示下检测仇恨言论的效果，发现其泛化能力优于微调编码器模型，但提示设计对性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法多忽略语言多样性，而多语言大语言模型的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了八种非英语语言的LLM提示技术，并与微调编码器模型对比。

Result: 零样本和少样本提示在真实数据集上表现较差，但在泛化测试中优于微调模型；提示设计对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 提示设计是关键，不同语言需定制化提示技术以优化仇恨言论检测效果。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing
approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual
instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ
offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in
identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains
underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight
non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing
them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot
prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world
evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for
hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a
critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting
techniques to maximize performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑数据组成的大语言模型（LLM）微调缩放定律，发现数据组成（如样本数量和平均长度）对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅以总token数衡量训练数据，忽略了数据组成（如样本数量和平均长度）对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过实验在BRICC和MMLU数据集上验证数据组成对token效率的影响，并调整缩放定律。

Result: 数据组成显著影响token效率，需在资源受限的微调中优化数据组成。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限的LLM微调提供了更精确的缩放定律。

Abstract: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under
fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition.
Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the
number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset
volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned
following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset
\cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset
\cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple
subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects
token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM
fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NLP的多维框架，用于客观分类心理咨询中的互动质量，通过文本转录分析，结合多种特征和分类器，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客户与治疗师之间的互动质量是治疗成功的关键因素，需要一种客观、可扩展的方法来评估。

Method: 使用253份动机访谈转录（150高质量，103低质量），提取42个特征（对话动态、语义相似性、情感分类、问题检测），并训练多种分类器（RF、Cat-Boost、SVM）。

Result: 在平衡数据上，RF准确率76.7%，SVM AUC 85.4%；数据增强后，RF准确率提升至88.9%，F1分数90.0%，AUC 94.6%。

Conclusion: 该框架具有扩展性，支持未来多模态扩展，为临床提供实时反馈，提升治疗互动质量。

Abstract: Engagement between client and therapist is a critical determinant of
therapeutic success. We propose a multi-dimensional natural language processing
(NLP) framework that objectively classifies engagement quality in counseling
sessions based on textual transcripts. Using 253 motivational interviewing
transcripts (150 high-quality, 103 low-quality), we extracted 42 features
across four domains: conversational dynamics, semantic similarity as topic
alignment, sentiment classification, and question detection. Classifiers,
including Random Forest (RF), Cat-Boost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM),
were hyperparameter tuned and trained using a stratified 5-fold
cross-validation and evaluated on a holdout test set. On balanced
(non-augmented) data, RF achieved the highest classification accuracy (76.7%),
and SVM achieved the highest AUC (85.4%). After SMOTE-Tomek augmentation,
performance improved significantly: RF achieved up to 88.9% accuracy, 90.0%
F1-score, and 94.6% AUC, while SVM reached 81.1% accuracy, 83.1% F1-score, and
93.6% AUC. The augmented data results reflect the potential of the framework in
future larger-scale applications. Feature contribution revealed conversational
dynamics and semantic similarity between clients and therapists were among the
top contributors, led by words uttered by the client (mean and standard
deviation). The framework was robust across the original and augmented datasets
and demonstrated consistent improvements in F1 scores and recall. While
currently text-based, the framework supports future multimodal extensions
(e.g., vocal tone, facial affect) for more holistic assessments. This work
introduces a scalable, data-driven method for evaluating engagement quality of
the therapy session, offering clinicians real-time feedback to enhance the
quality of both virtual and in-person therapeutic interactions.

Motivation: 解决从生物医学研究中提取科学证据的挑战，尤其是在临床问题中存在冲突证据的情况下。

Method: 创建了CochraneForest数据集，并提出URCA框架，结合检索和生成技术进行证据提取。

Result: URCA在F1分数上比现有方法高出10.3%，但CochraneForest的复杂性也凸显了任务的难度。

Conclusion: CochraneForest是一个具有挑战性的测试平台，URCA为自动化证据合成系统提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Extracting scientific evidence from biomedical studies for clinical research
questions (e.g., Does stem cell transplantation improve quality of life in
patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease compared to placebo?) is a
crucial step in synthesising biomedical evidence. In this paper, we focus on
the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical
questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset
called CochraneForest, leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic
reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research
questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on
CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique
challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms
the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the
results also underscore the complexity of CochraneForest, establishing it as a
challenging testbed for advancing automated evidence synthesis systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着前沿AI系统向变革性能力发展，需要改进测量和评估方法以确保安全并为治理提供依据。

Method: 通过行为技术（如脚手架、红队测试和监督微调）和内部技术（如表示分析和机械可解释性）测量能力、倾向和控制等属性。

Result: 展示了评估如何超越基准测试，测量模型在极限下的能力、默认行为倾向以及安全措施的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文整合了分散的资源，旨在为理解AI安全评估提供核心参考，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: As frontier AI systems advance toward transformative capabilities, we need a
parallel transformation in how we measure and evaluate these systems to ensure
safety and inform governance. While benchmarks have been the primary method for
estimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds
or predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly
evolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around
three dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how
these measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond
benchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit
(capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities),
and whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with
subversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through
behavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning,
alongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic
interpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical
capabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous
replication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like
power-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods
integrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete
development decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations -
proving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives
for "safetywashing" - while identifying promising research directions. By
synthesizing scattered resources, this literature review aims to provide a
central reference point for understanding AI safety evaluations.

TL;DR: HiBayES是一个分层贝叶斯建模框架，用于评估AI系统的能力，支持低数据场景下的鲁棒推断和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统的发展，从随机输出中准确评估其能力并量化不确定性变得至关重要。

Method: 基于广义线性模型（GLMs）、贝叶斯数据分析和正式模型比较，构建了HiBayES框架。

Result: HiBayES在低数据场景下表现优异，提供了原则性的不确定性量化和鲁棒参数估计。

Conclusion: HiBayES是一个通用且实用的框架，适用于AI评估，并提供了软件包支持。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly
estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while
systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly
important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical
structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in
testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI
Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical
question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in
low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model
comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust
parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to
HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional
statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel
Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta
version) for out-of-the-box implementation.

types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data
evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation
achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing)
and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%.
In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774),
while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap
provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response
prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform
for advancing drug discovery and translational research.

Result: 微调后的LLM能捕捉生化知识，多任务学习通过共享酶信息提升了正向和逆向合成的预测性能，但在酶分类号预测上存在挑战。

Conclusion: LLM在生化建模中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以解决酶分类等局限性。

Abstract: Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis,
metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and
resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through
their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and
leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically
evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and
70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction,
forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask
learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA
adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to
explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning
enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared
enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges
in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further
improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptMeta通过整合元语义和关系信息，显著提升了少样本知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) has obtained significant attention
due to its practical applications in real-world scenarios, where new knowledge
often emerges with limited available data. While most existing methods for
few-shot KGC have predominantly focused on leveraging relational information,
rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To address this
gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that
seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot
KGC. PrompMeta has two key innovations: (1) a meta-semantic prompt pool that
captures and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective
knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations. (2) a
learnable fusion prompt that dynamically combines meta-semantic information
with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks.
Both components are optimized together with model parameters within a
meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的预训练方法，通过共享Q网络结构提升离线强化学习的数据效率。


<details>

Motivation: 离线强化学习需要从静态数据集中学习策略，但数据收集成本高且受限，如何用最少数据学习最优策略是关键问题。

Method: 提出共享Q网络结构，通过监督回归任务预训练网络，预测下一状态和Q值，并与多种离线RL方法结合使用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在D4RL、Robomimic和V-D4RL基准测试中提升了性能，且在数据质量和分布不同的情况下显著提升数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法仅用10%数据即可超越标准算法在全数据集上的表现，具有显著的数据效率优势。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static
dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting
sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data
collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky
when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent
learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in
offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to
initialize a feature of a $Q$-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL.
Specifically, we introduce a shared $Q$-network structure that outputs
predictions of the next state and $Q$-value. We pretrain the shared $Q$-network
through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the
shared $Q$-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the
performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and
V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts
data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions
trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of
the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.

Result: 在miniF2F基准测试中达到75.0%的准确率，显著降低了采样复杂度。

Conclusion: APOLLO展示了编译器引导的LLM输出修复在自动定理证明中的潜力。

Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging
subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving
mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification
system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost
instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large
language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the
literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one
of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we
present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a
modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean
compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation
results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in
which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the
proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean,
isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on
each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are
recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of
attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art
accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget
below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for
Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few
hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40%
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM
outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a
general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

Motivation: 现代企业和组织需要监控和分析过程痕迹，但在事件与参考业务活动之间存在差距时，会产生解释问题。传统基于推理的方法在高度不确定或未明确的事件映射中可能效果不佳且计算量大。

Conclusion: 该方法为绿色AI提供了一种高效解决方案，减少了劳动力和计算成本，同时提升了环境和社会可持续性。

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern
companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace
events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation
problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the
corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that
frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract
Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event
interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations
for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where
event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this
reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy
computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to
suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.
However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of
manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing
Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with
reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a
data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the
candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is
refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior
knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by
experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings
where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent
constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于伪布尔编码的方法，用于高效处理特征模型中的复杂依赖关系，显著提升了表达性约束的自动化推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代特征建模语言中的表达性构造（如基数约束）难以转换为CNF形式，限制了自动化推理工具的应用范围。

Method: 1. 提出伪布尔编码方法，减少常用构造的表示复杂度；2. 开发了一种将伪布尔公式编译为布尔d-DNNF的新方法。

Result: 实验表明，伪布尔编码方法在表达性约束的处理速度上显著优于基于CNF的现有方法，且在基础构造上仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 伪布尔编码方法有效缩短了表达性构造与自动化推理之间的差距，为特征建模提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Configurable systems typically consist of reusable assets that have
dependencies between each other. To specify such dependencies, feature models
are commonly used. As feature models in practice are often complex, automated
reasoning is typically employed to analyze the dependencies. Here, the de facto
standard is translating the feature model to conjunctive normal form (CNF) to
enable employing off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT or #SAT solvers. However,
modern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality
constraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between
the input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects
limits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we
shorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated
reasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean
encoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of
commonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a
novel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF. With the
compiled d-DNNFs, we can resort to a plethora of efficient analyses already
used in feature modeling. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposal
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art based on CNF inputs for
expressive constructs. For every considered dataset representing different
feature models and feature-modeling constructs, the feature models can be
significantly faster translated to pseudo-Boolean than to CNF. Overall,
deriving d-DNNFs from a feature model with the targeted expressive constraints
can be substantially accelerated using our pseudo-Boolean approach.
Furthermore, our approach is competitive on feature models with only basic
constructs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在艺术品解释中缺乏文化、历史和风格等细微理解，ArtRAG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建艺术上下文知识图（ACKG）并结合多粒度检索器，ArtRAG为MLLMs提供上下文和文化信息。

Result: 在SemArt和Artpedia数据集上，ArtRAG表现优于多个基线模型，人类评估也证实其生成内容更具洞察力和文化丰富性。

Conclusion: ArtRAG通过结构化知识和检索增强生成，显著提升了艺术品解释的质量和深度。

Abstract: Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives --
cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While
recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image
captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine
art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines
structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art
Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing
entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich,
interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever
selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation.
This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art
descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG
outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further
confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched
interpretations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在3D对象引用识别任务中，模型错误预测的原因不明的问题，帮助实践者和工程师更好地理解模型行为。

Method: 方法是通过生成反事实示例，即对误分类样本（包含两个对象和文本描述）生成语义相似但能导致正确预测的替代描述。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法增强了模型行为的理解，有助于实践者与系统交互和工程师改进模型。

Abstract: Combining natural language and geometric shapes is an emerging research area
with multiple applications in robotics and language-assisted design. A crucial
task in this domain is object referent identification, which involves selecting
a 3D object given a textual description of the target. Variability in language
descriptions and spatial relationships of 3D objects makes this a complex task,
increasing the need to better understand the behavior of neural network models
in this domain. However, limited research has been conducted in this area.
Specifically, when a model makes an incorrect prediction despite being provided
with a seemingly correct object description, practitioners are left wondering:
"Why is the model wrong?". In this work, we present a method answering this
question by generating counterfactual examples. Our method takes a
misclassified sample, which includes two objects and a text description, and
generates an alternative yet similar formulation that would have resulted in a
correct prediction by the model. We have evaluated our approach with data from
the ShapeTalk dataset along with three distinct models. Our counterfactual
examples maintain the structure of the original description, are semantically
similar and meaningful. They reveal weaknesses in the description, model bias
and enhance the understanding of the models behavior. Theses insights help
practitioners to better interact with systems as well as engineers to improve
models.

Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略条件依赖关系，仅关注发现序列模式，而本文旨在同时发现条件和无条件依赖关系。

Method: 通过形式化最小描述长度原则问题，提出Seqret方法，以高效发现高质量的规则集。

Result: Seqret在合成数据集中能准确恢复真实情况，并在真实数据集中发现有用规则。

Conclusion: Seqret方法优于现有技术，能够有效发现事件序列中的依赖关系。

Abstract: Summarizing event sequences is a key aspect of data mining. Most existing
methods neglect conditional dependencies and focus on discovering sequential
patterns only. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering both
conditional and unconditional dependencies from event sequence data. We do so
by discovering rules of the form $X \rightarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are
sequential patterns. Rules like these are simple to understand and provide a
clear description of the relation between the antecedent and the consequent. To
discover succinct and non-redundant sets of rules we formalize the problem in
terms of the Minimum Description Length principle. As the search space is
enormous and does not exhibit helpful structure, we propose the Seqret method
to discover high-quality rule sets in practice. Through extensive empirical
evaluation we show that unlike the state of the art, Seqret ably recovers the
ground truth on synthetic datasets and finds useful rules from real datasets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在硬件设计任务（如生成功能Verilog代码）中的能力有限，且现有数据集存在版权问题。

Method: 提出评估基准和开源数据集FreeSet，并采用自动化框架进行数据筛选，通过持续预训练微调Llama模型（FreeV）。

Result: FreeV的版权侵权风险最低（3%违规率），且在Verilog生成功能上优于基线模型（VerilogEval pass@10提升10%以上）。

Conclusion: FreeSet和FreeV有效降低了版权风险并提升了Verilog生成能力。

Abstract: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design
tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various
fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source
repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain
minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright
violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to
estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected
codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset,
FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation
framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data.
We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual
pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our
results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of
copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate.
Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog
generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10
rates by over 10%.

Abstract: This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can
learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a
vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object,
relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation
outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel
concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and
reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of
symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such
neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to
solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos,
3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework
offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional
generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了NCO在大规模问题上的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Constructive neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has attracted growing
research attention due to its ability to solve complex routing problems without
relying on handcrafted rules. However, existing NCO methods face significant
challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational
complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this
issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that
adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the
constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed
heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned
patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on
100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to
large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform
distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.

Abstract: Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and
interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most
deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away
temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating
neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce
neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought
Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core
representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal
processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a
history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a
latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified
neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological
realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures
essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep
learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a
range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D
mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond
displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for
interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks
that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive
compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when
faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the
CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new
state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a
significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful
artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information
accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small
planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots
deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community
has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest
implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the
strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a
quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation
in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of
directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically.
We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used
algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered
in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and
two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO
(Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established
dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning
community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the
theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust
manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques,
such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well
as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of
algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering
truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在时间序列处理中潜力巨大且能耗低，但缺乏高效训练算法，传统反向传播方法存在扩展性和数值精度问题。

Method: 采用交替方向乘子法（ADMM）解决SNN阶跃函数的不可微问题，推导闭式更新并验证收敛性。

Result: 实验证明ADMM方法具有良好收敛性和潜力，为未来改进提供了方向。

Conclusion: ADMM为SNN训练提供了新思路，但仍需进一步研究优化。

Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to
their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy
consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training
algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from
stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks
when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low
scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN
training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step
function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form
updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great
potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a
simulated proof-of-concept.

Abstract: With unprecedented rapid development, deep neural networks (DNNs) have deeply
influenced almost all fields. However, their heavy computation costs and model
sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an
effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in
the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the
conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones,
which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition
and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the
conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become
increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion
and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent
five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare
the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main
categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques.
Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field
of model quantization. A curated list of model quantization is provided at

TL;DR: 论文提出了RELGCL，一种基于相对相似性的图对比学习框架，通过保留图中自然编码的相对相似性模式，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图对比学习（GCL）在计算机视觉中依赖绝对相似性，但在图中由于离散性和非欧几里得性质，这种方法面临语义破坏和相似性验证不可靠的问题。

Method: 通过分析11个真实图数据，发现标签一致性随结构距离增加的衰减模式，并基于随机游走理论建立理论保证。提出RELGCL框架，通过成对和列表实现保留集体相似性目标。

Result: RELGCL在20种现有方法中表现最优，验证了利用自然相对相似性优于人工绝对相似性的有效性。

Conclusion: 图中自然编码的相对相似性模式是更有效的学习目标，RELGCL框架为图对比学习提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following
the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between
augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs
due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks
semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through
analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending
the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically
diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in
homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish
theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving
label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind
different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode
relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit
collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we
propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise
implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective
similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and
heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative
similarity over artificial absolute similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG分类方法难以同时捕捉局部形态细节和长程时间依赖性，Cardioformer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多尺度标记嵌入捕捉局部和全局特征，并通过自注意力机制选择性融合这些表示。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别为96.34（MIMIC-IV）、89.99（PTB-XL）和95.59（PTB），优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Cardioformer在ECG分析中表现出色，有望推动心血管疾病的自动化诊断。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is crucial for automated cardiac
disease diagnosis, yet existing methods often struggle to capture local
morphological details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To
address these challenges, we propose Cardioformer, a novel multi-granularity
hybrid model that integrates cross-channel patching, hierarchical residual
learning, and a two-stage self-attention mechanism. Cardioformer first encodes
multi-scale token embeddings to capture fine-grained local features and global
contextual information and then selectively fuses these representations through
intra- and inter-granularity self-attention. Extensive evaluations on three
benchmark ECG datasets under subject-independent settings demonstrate that
model consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines. Our
Cardioformer model achieves the AUROC of 96.34$\pm$0.11, 89.99$\pm$0.12, and
95.59$\pm$1.66 in MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL and PTB dataset respectively outperforming
PatchTST, Reformer, Transformer, and Medformer models. It also demonstrates
strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving 49.18% AUROC on PTB and 68.41%
on PTB-XL when trained on MIMIC-IV. These findings underscore the potential of
Cardioformer to advance automated ECG analysis, paving the way for more
accurate and robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis. We release the source

Abstract: We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed
specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models
focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder
to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by
incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes
pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders
for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative
components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural
networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on
large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across
various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates
superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in
low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and
diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its
potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs. Code available

Abstract: Existing biomedical benchmarks do not provide end-to-end infrastructure for
training, evaluation, and inference of models that integrate multimodal
biological data and a broad range of machine learning tasks in therapeutics. We
present PyTDC, an open-source machine-learning platform providing streamlined
training, evaluation, and inference software for multimodal biological AI

sources and model weights and standardizes benchmarking and inference

our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell
drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph
representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform
poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning
method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline

Motivation: 随着机器学习算法在关键决策中的作用日益重要，理解人类对其的策略行为（如改进或欺骗）及其公平性影响变得至关重要。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈模型，研究个体在分类器下的策略选择（改进或欺骗），并分析不同成本和随机效应对策略的影响。

Result: 揭示了不同类型的代理响应，并据此优化分类器设计，表明战略政策可以防止欺骗并激励改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，算法设计者可以通过战略政策引导个体选择改进而非欺骗，从而提升公平性和系统效率。

Abstract: As machine learning algorithms increasingly influence critical decision
making in different application areas, understanding human strategic behavior
in response to these systems becomes vital. We explore individuals' choice
between genuinely improving their qualifications (``improvement'') vs.
attempting to deceive the algorithm by manipulating their features
(``manipulation'') in response to an algorithmic decision system. We further
investigate an algorithm designer's ability to shape these strategic responses,
and its fairness implications. Specifically, we formulate these interactions as
a Stackelberg game, where a firm deploys a (fair) classifier, and individuals
strategically respond. Our model incorporates both different costs and
stochastic efficacy for manipulation and improvement. The analysis reveals
different potential classes of agent responses, and characterizes optimal
classifiers accordingly. Based on these, we highlight the impact of the firm's
anticipation of strategic behavior, identifying when and why a (fair) strategic
policy can not only prevent manipulation, but also incentivize agents to opt
for improvement.

Abstract: Although prototype-based explanations provide a human-understandable way of
representing model predictions they often fail to direct user attention to the
most relevant features. We propose a novel approach to identify the most
informative features within prototypes, termed alike parts. Using feature
importance scores derived from an agnostic explanation method, it emphasizes
the most relevant overlapping features between an instance and its nearest
prototype. Furthermore, the feature importance score is incorporated into the
objective function of the prototype selection algorithms to promote global
prototypes diversity. Through experiments on six benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that the proposed approach improves user comprehension while
maintaining or even increasing predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning for conversion prediction has found widespread applications in
online advertising. These models have become more complex as they are trained
to jointly predict multiple objectives such as click, add-to-cart, checkout and
other conversion types. Additionally, the capacity and performance of these
models can often be increased with the use of embedding tables that encode high
cardinality categorical features such as advertiser, user, campaign, and
product identifiers (IDs). These embedding tables can be pre-trained, but also
learned end-to-end jointly with the model to directly optimize the model
objectives. Training these large tables is challenging due to: gradient
sparsity, the high cardinality of the categorical features, the non-uniform
distribution of IDs and the very high label sparsity. These issues make
training prone to both slow convergence and overfitting after the first epoch.
Previous works addressed the multi-epoch overfitting issue by using: stronger
feature hashing to reduce cardinality, filtering of low frequency IDs,
regularization of the embedding tables, re-initialization of the embedding
tables after each epoch, etc. Some of these techniques reduce overfitting at
the expense of reduced model performance if used too aggressively. In this
paper, we share key learnings from the development of embedding table
optimization and multi-epoch training in Pinterest Ads Conversion models. We
showcase how our Sparse Optimizer speeds up convergence, and how multi-epoch
overfitting varies in severity between different objectives in a multi-task
model depending on label sparsity. We propose a new approach to deal with
multi-epoch overfitting: the use of a frequency-adaptive learning rate on the
embedding tables and compare it to embedding re-initialization. We evaluate
both methods offline using an industrial large-scale production dataset.

Abstract: In performative Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent faces a
policy-dependent environment: the reward and transition functions depend on the
agent's policy. Prior work on performative RL has studied the convergence of
repeated retraining approaches to a performatively stable policy. In the finite
sample regime, these approaches repeatedly solve for a saddle point of a
convex-concave objective, which estimates the Lagrangian of a regularized
version of the reinforcement learning problem. In this paper, we aim to extend
such repeated retraining approaches, enabling them to operate under corrupted
data. More specifically, we consider Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model,
where an $\epsilon$ fraction of data points is corrupted by arbitrary
adversarial noise. We propose a repeated retraining approach based on
convex-concave optimization under corrupted gradients and a novel
problem-specific robust mean estimator for the gradients. We prove that our
approach exhibits last-iterate convergence to an approximately stable policy,
with the approximation error linear in $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. We experimentally
demonstrate the importance of accounting for corruption in performative RL.

Abstract: Estimating rate constants from complex chemical reactions is essential for
advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world
atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training
instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate constant estimation
using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff
Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction
modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a
latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between
chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit
Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate
coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a
neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate
the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff
Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising
directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

Abstract: Molecular interactions often involve high-order relationships that cannot be
fully captured by traditional graph-based models limited to pairwise
connections. Hypergraphs naturally extend graphs by enabling multi-way
interactions, making them well-suited for modeling complex molecular systems.
In this work, we introduce EquiHGNN, an Equivariant HyperGraph Neural Network
framework that integrates symmetry-aware representations to improve molecular
modeling. By enforcing the equivariance under relevant transformation groups,
our approach preserves geometric and topological properties, leading to more
robust and physically meaningful representations. We examine a range of
equivariant architectures and demonstrate that integrating symmetry constraints
leads to notable performance gains on large-scale molecular datasets.
Experiments on both small and large molecules show that high-order interactions
offer limited benefits for small molecules but consistently outperform 2D
graphs on larger ones. Adding geometric features to these high-order structures
further improves the performance, emphasizing the value of spatial information
in molecular learning. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 在非依从性情况下，现有方法（如SBD和CFD）的估计方差差异未被充分研究，尤其是在治疗效果较小时。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析比较SBD和CFD的方差，并引入LobsterNet（一种多任务神经网络）来联合建模CFD中的多个干扰参数。

Result: CFD在治疗效果较小时方差更低；LobsterNet在多个半合成和真实数据集上减少了估计误差。

Conclusion: CFD结合共享干扰参数建模（如LobsterNet）可以改善非依从性下的治疗效果估计。

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment
decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to
their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the
conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the
treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these
approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the
literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD
yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment
assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in
patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple
nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that
implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically,
LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and
real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared
nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation
under non-adherence.

Conclusion: 该方法保留了超图的所有结构信息，并首次将神经层扩散扩展到超图（HNSD），实验证明了其竞争力。

Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in
hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of
arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial
sets derived directly from hypergraphs, which encode all possible oriented
subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction
canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving
hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf
Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the
traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs,
validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory.
Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from
the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is
faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural
Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf
Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf
Laplacians over symmetric simplicial sets, resolving orientation ambiguity and
adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate HNSD's competitive performance across established benchmarks.

Abstract: The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention
and excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms
and re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment
of trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to
realize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and
evaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a
possibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its
behavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the
data they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor.
This paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with
methods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model
trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm
deploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory
focus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of
Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the
collective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that
while differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it
introduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We
characterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under
differential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's
privacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating
collective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across
several datasets.

### [60] [Automated Learning of Semantic Embedding Representations for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05732)
*Limai Jiang,Yunpeng Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多级去噪自编码器框架，扩展了去噪扩散模型（DDMs）的表征能力，通过自条件扩散学习生成语义丰富的嵌入表示。实验表明，该方法在多数情况下优于现有的自监督表征学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪扩散模型（DDMs）在生成任务中表现出色，但其表征学习能力尚未充分开发。本文旨在通过多级框架提升DDMs的表征能力，验证其在通用深度学习任务中的潜力。

Method: 采用多级去噪自编码器框架，引入时序一致的扩散变换器和时间步依赖的编码器，通过自条件扩散学习在去噪马尔可夫链上获取嵌入表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的嵌入表示在语义上优于现有的自监督学习方法，展示了DDMs在通用深度学习任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDMs不仅适用于生成任务，还可能为通用深度学习任务提供优势，本文为其表征学习能力提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Generative models capture the true distribution of data, yielding
semantically rich representations. Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit
superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for
them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder
framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces
sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional
timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the
denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning.
Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process,
compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under
different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across
all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through
this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets,
demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases,
achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work
justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also
potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种新的多变量时间序列预测方法，通过离线聚类提取原型来简化长距离依赖建模，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于Transformer的模型）计算复杂度高，难以高效捕捉长距离依赖和实体间交互。

Method: FOCUS通过离线聚类提取原型，在线阶段动态适配输入段与高级事件间的依赖关系。

Result: FOCUS在多个基准测试中达到最先进的准确性，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过原型建模实现了高效且准确的多变量时间序列预测。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is
essential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction,
which depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions
between entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer
architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to
a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the
input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline
Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that
simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes
extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level
events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key
characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS
dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures
dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both
accurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the
offline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of
modeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: 该算法首次实现全局最优解，适用于小规模数据集，并通过核心集扩展至大规模数据，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first globally optimal algorithm for the empirical
risk minimization problem of two-layer maxout and ReLU networks, i.e.,
minimizing the number of misclassifications. The algorithm has a worst-case
time complexity of $O\left(N^{DK+1}\right)$, where $K$ denotes the number of
hidden neurons and $D$ represents the number of features. It can be can be
generalized to accommodate arbitrary computable loss functions without
affecting its computational complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm provides provably exact solutions for small-scale datasets.
To handle larger datasets, we introduce a novel coreset selection method that
reduces the data size to a manageable scale, making it feasible for our
algorithm. This extension enables efficient processing of large-scale datasets
and achieves significantly improved performance, with a 20-30\% reduction in
misclassifications for both training and prediction, compared to
state-of-the-art approaches (neural networks trained using gradient descent and
support vector machines), when applied to the same models (two-layer networks
with fixed hidden nodes and linear models).

Method: 框架包括三个阶段：LLM生成解释、解释引导演示选择、解释引导SLM预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多个表格数据集上平均准确率提升5.31%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了表格预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex
tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However,
existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal
demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder
their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome
these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular
prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to
guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make
interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves
three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to
generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations,
providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc
Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations
generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from
candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM
Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as
in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the
performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs.
Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average
accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可学习随机游走（LRW）的图OOD泛化方法（LRW-OOD），通过参数化转移矩阵和KDE-based MI损失，显著提升了图OOD泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图OOD方法基于不变拓扑或谱的假设可能与现实不符，因此需要更灵活的框架来捕捉不变知识。

Method: 采用可学习随机游走（LRW）视角，参数化转移矩阵，并设计KDE-based MI损失生成符合OOD原则的随机游走序列。

Result: 实验表明，LRW-OOD在多种分布偏移下显著提升泛化性能，准确率比现有方法提高3.87%。

Conclusion: LRW-OOD为图OOD泛化提供了一种有效且灵活的方法，验证了LRW视角的实用性。

Abstract: Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization has gained increasing attentions for
machine learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit
performance degradation under distribution shifts. Existing graph OOD methods
tend to follow the basic ideas of invariant risk minimization and structural
causal models, interpreting the invariant knowledge across datasets under
various distribution shifts as graph topology or graph spectrum. However, these
interpretations may be inconsistent with real-world scenarios, as neither
invariant topology nor spectrum is assured. In this paper, we advocate the
learnable random walk (LRW) perspective as the instantiation of invariant
knowledge, and propose LRW-OOD to realize graph OOD generalization learning.
Instead of employing fixed probability transition matrix (i.e.,
degree-normalized adjacency matrix), we parameterize the transition matrix with
an LRW-sampler and a path encoder. Furthermore, we propose the kernel density
estimation (KDE)-based mutual information (MI) loss to generate random walk
sequences that adhere to OOD principles. Extensive experiment demonstrates that
our model can effectively enhance graph OOD generalization under various types
of distribution shifts and yield a significant accuracy improvement of 3.87%
over state-of-the-art graph OOD generalization baselines.

FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration
significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI
applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of
ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification
performance.

Conclusion: MxMoE为MoE模型提供了一种高效的混合精度优化方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face deployment challenges due to their large
parameter counts and computational demands. We explore quantization for MoE
models and highlight two key insights: 1) linear blocks exhibit varying
quantization sensitivity, and 2) divergent expert activation frequencies create
heterogeneous computational characteristics. Based on these observations, we
introduce MxMoE, a mixed-precision optimization framework for MoE models that
considers both algorithmic and system perspectives. MxMoE navigates the design
space defined by parameter sensitivity, expert activation dynamics, and
hardware resources to derive efficient mixed-precision configurations.
Additionally, MxMoE automatically generates optimized mixed-precision GroupGEMM
kernels, enabling parallel execution of GEMMs with different precisions.
Evaluations show that MxMoE outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.4 lower
Wikitext-2 perplexity than GPTQ at 2.25-bit and delivering up to 3.4x speedup
over full precision, as well as up to 29.4% speedup over uniform quantization
at equivalent accuracy with 5-bit weight-activation quantization. Our code is

Conclusion: ACLA模型显著提高了SOH估计的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for
ensuring the safe and reliable operation of electric vehicles. Nevertheless,
the prevailing SOH estimation methods often have limited generalizability. This
paper introduces a data-driven approach for estimating the SOH of LIBs, which
is designed to improve generalization. We construct a hybrid model named ACLA,
which integrates the attention mechanism, convolutional neural network (CNN),
and long short-term memory network (LSTM) into the augmented neural ordinary
differential equation (ANODE) framework. This model employs normalized charging
time corresponding to specific voltages in the constant current charging phase
as input and outputs the SOH as well as remaining useful of life. The model is
trained on NASA and Oxford datasets and validated on the TJU and HUST datasets.
Compared to the benchmark models NODE and ANODE, ACLA exhibits higher accuracy
with root mean square errors (RMSE) for SOH estimation as low as 1.01% and

Motivation: 研究BCE在多类任务中的表现，探索其与CE在特征学习中的差异。

Method: 理论分析和实验验证，比较BCE和CE在特征学习中的表现。

Result: BCE通过调整决策分数的绝对值和分类器偏置，能更好地增强特征的紧凑性和区分性。

Conclusion: BCE在多类任务中表现优异，能提升分类性能并改善特征性质。

Abstract: When training classification models, it expects that the learned features are
compact within classes, and can well separate different classes. As the
dominant loss function for training classification models, minimizing
cross-entropy (CE) loss maximizes the compactness and distinctiveness, i.e.,
reaching neural collapse (NC). The recent works show that binary CE (BCE)
performs also well in multi-class tasks. In this paper, we compare BCE and CE
in deep feature learning. For the first time, we prove that BCE can also
maximize the intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness when
reaching its minimum, i.e., leading to NC. We point out that CE measures the
relative values of decision scores in the model training, implicitly enhancing
the feature properties by classifying samples one-by-one. In contrast, BCE
measures the absolute values of decision scores and adjust the
positive/negative decision scores across all samples to uniformly high/low
levels. Meanwhile, the classifier biases in BCE present a substantial
constraint on the decision scores to explicitly enhance the feature properties
in the training. The experimental results are aligned with above analysis, and
show that BCE could improve the classification and leads to better compactness
and distinctiveness among sample features. The codes will be released.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning junta distributions on $\{0, 1\}^n$, where a
distribution is a $k$-junta if its probability mass function depends on a
subset of at most $k$ variables. We make two main contributions:
  - We show that learning $k$-junta distributions is \emph{computationally}
equivalent to learning $k$-parity functions with noise (LPN), a landmark
problem in computational learning theory.
  - We design an algorithm for learning junta distributions whose statistical
complexity is optimal, up to polylogarithmic factors. Computationally, our
algorithm matches the complexity of previous (non-sample-optimal) algorithms.
  Combined, our two contributions imply that our algorithm cannot be
significantly improved, statistically or computationally, barring a
breakthrough for LPN.

Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant
success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social
sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly
sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups
they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around
fairness, transparency, robustness, and privacy, among others. As the
complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are
deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these
challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding
responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while
maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently
transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain
specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and
comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and
practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML,
their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building
ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical
formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for
efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a
discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing
suggestions for future work.

<details>

Motivation: 开放集标签偏移（OSLS）在目标分布中存在额外分布外（OOD）类别时发生，需要有效估计源和目标标签分布以调整分类器。

Method: 1）估计源标签分布中的OOD类别；2）使用EM算法进行目标标签分布的最大似然估计；3）在宽松假设下估计目标标签分布中的OOD类别。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多种开放集标签偏移场景中有效，且无需重新训练即可调整分类器。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段估计方法能有效处理开放集标签偏移，并量化误差，为分类器调整提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Open set label shift (OSLS) occurs when label distributions change from a
source to a target distribution, and the target distribution has an additional
out-of-distribution (OOD) class. In this work, we build estimators for both
source and target open set label distributions using a source domain
in-distribution (ID) classifier and an ID/OOD classifier. With reasonable
assumptions on the ID/OOD classifier, the estimators are assembled into a
sequence of three stages: 1) an estimate of the source label distribution of
the OOD class, 2) an EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimates (MLE) of the
target label distribution, and 3) an estimate of the target label distribution
of OOD class under relaxed assumptions on the OOD classifier. The sampling
errors of estimates in 1) and 3) are quantified with a concentration
inequality. The estimation result allows us to correct the ID classifier
trained on the source distribution to the target distribution without
retraining. Experiments on a variety of open set label shift settings
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our code is available at

Motivation: 语言模型依赖虚假相关性（捷径）取得许多成功，但此前研究仅关注输入元素对预测的影响，本文旨在揭示捷径在模型决策机制中的具体处理方式。

Method: 使用电影评论中的演员名称作为可控捷径，通过机制解释方法识别关注捷径的特定注意力头，并提出了Head-based Token Attribution（HTA）方法。

Result: 发现特定注意力头会引导模型提前做出决策，绕过上下文分析；HTA能有效检测捷径并选择性关闭相关注意力头以缓解问题。

Conclusion: HTA为理解和缓解语言模型中的捷径问题提供了新工具，揭示了捷径在模型内部的具体作用机制。

Abstract: Reliance on spurious correlations (shortcuts) has been shown to underlie many
of the successes of language models. Previous work focused on identifying the
input elements that impact prediction. We investigate how shortcuts are
actually processed within the model's decision-making mechanism. We use actor
names in movie reviews as controllable shortcuts with known impact on the
outcome. We use mechanistic interpretability methods and identify specific
attention heads that focus on shortcuts. These heads gear the model towards a
label before processing the complete input, effectively making premature
decisions that bypass contextual analysis. Based on these findings, we
introduce Head-based Token Attribution (HTA), which traces intermediate
decisions back to input tokens. We show that HTA is effective in detecting
shortcuts in LLMs and enables targeted mitigation by selectively deactivating
shortcut-related attention heads.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂系统和实际场景中具有广泛应用潜力，支持科学发现。

Abstract: Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising
approach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However,
purely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with
optimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that
incorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate
the discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures
composed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model,
called EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of
generation evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the
most suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can
recover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency,
particularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate
spatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The
approach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher
dimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously
unreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating
toward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its
applicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific
discovery.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的分子可能无法与高度保守的蛋白质残基形成相互作用，而这些残基对蛋白质功能和配体生物活性至关重要。

Method: 开发DiffDecip模型，在扩散和采样过程中明确结合蛋白质-配体结合相互作用和残基进化保守信息，用于通过骨架修饰优化分子。

Abstract: Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion
models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule
optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction
guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming
favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules
may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are
important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we
developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly
incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary
conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling
process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model
performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on
molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent
interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态分子表示学习中直接融合不同模态信息，忽略了模态间交互的潜力，未能充分捕捉分子间复杂的高阶关系和不变特征。

Method: MMSA框架包含多模态分子表示学习模块和结构感知模块，前者协同处理同一分子的多模态信息生成统一嵌入，后者通过超图结构建模分子间高阶关联并引入记忆机制存储典型分子表示。

Conclusion: MMSA通过结构感知和多模态自监督学习有效提升了分子表示的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the
drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in
molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular
representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become
increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often
directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential
of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex
higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal
self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed
to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge
between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal
molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module.
The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively
processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to
overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding.
Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular
representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order
correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism
for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory
anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving
the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the
effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to
9.6% over baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列数据包含丰富的动态信息，而传统RNN在建模和预测时未能充分利用预测误差。受卡尔曼滤波中“创新”概念的启发，作者希望通过引入历史预测误差来增强RNN的性能。

Method: 提出IRNN架构，将历史预测误差作为额外输入信号更新RNN的隐藏状态。针对创新数据依赖网络参数的特点，设计了IU-BPTT训练算法，交替更新创新数据和优化网络参数。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，IRNN显著提升了预测精度，且训练成本未显著增加。

Conclusion: IRNN通过引入创新概念有效提升了时间序列预测性能，为RNN的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are time series that are sequentially collected and
contain rich temporal information. Thus, a common interest in practice is to
capture dynamics of time series and predict their future evolutions. To this
end, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been a prevalent and effective
machine learning option, which admits a nonlinear state-space model
representation. Motivated by the resemblance between RNN and Kalman filter (KF)
for linear state-space models, we propose in this paper Innovation-driven RNN
(IRNN), a novel RNN architecture tailored to time-series data modeling and
prediction tasks. By adapting the concept of "innovation" from KF to RNN, past
prediction errors are adopted as additional input signals to update hidden
states of RNN and boost prediction performance. Since innovation data depend on
network parameters, existing training algorithms for RNN do not apply to IRNN
straightforwardly. Thus, a tailored training algorithm dubbed input
updating-based back-propagation through time (IU-BPTT) is further proposed,
which alternates between updating innovations and optimizing network parameters
via gradient descent. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that
the integration of innovations into various forms of RNN leads to remarkably
improved prediction accuracy of IRNN without increasing the training cost
substantially.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习（CIL）中任务混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，同时降低内存和计算复杂度。

Method: 使用HAE作为压缩器，结合判别和生成建模，采用带电粒子系统能量最小化方程和排斥力算法进行增量嵌入和类中心分布。

Result: AHR在相同内存/计算预算下，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: AHR是一种高效且性能优越的类增量学习策略，适合实际应用。

Abstract: In class-incremental learning (CIL), effective incremental learning
strategies are essential to mitigate task confusion and catastrophic
forgetting, especially as the number of tasks $t$ increases. Current exemplar
replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We
propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our
new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the
requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case
with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing
state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data
stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is
designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling
classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged
particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for
the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent
space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent
baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same
memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary
material and will be open-sourced upon publication.

TL;DR: FloE是一个针对内存受限GPU的MoE推理系统，通过压缩专家参数矩阵和稀疏预测，显著减少数据传输负担，提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型的广泛应用，内存受限设备上的高效推理需求日益增长，而现有方法因PCIe带宽限制无法满足低延迟场景。

Method: FloE利用稀疏激活专家中的冗余，采用参数矩阵压缩和低成本稀疏预测技术，减少数据传输负担。

Result: 在Mixtral-8x7B上，FloE实现了9.3倍的专家参数压缩，内存占用减少8.5倍，推理速度提升48.7倍。

Conclusion: FloE有效解决了内存受限设备上MoE推理的效率和延迟问题，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a
growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While
offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on
demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts
overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in
latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly
MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight
that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated
experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal
parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost
sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock
time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x
compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a
GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and
delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single
GeForce RTX 3090.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有功率控制方法主要关注数据平面，忽视了信令开销的影响，且依赖网络中心视角和完整信道状态信息（CSI）。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多智能体近端策略优化（MAPPO）和部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）建模，实现自主学习和优化。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法将信令开销降低至原来的1/8，同时缓冲刷新率仅比理想方法低5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在6G工厂子网络中有效优化了功率控制和信令协议，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range
communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios,
effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference
resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to
power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane,
often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has
typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of
complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available
at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to
autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory
Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy
optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages.
The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces
signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that
lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.

Motivation: 离线多智能体强化学习面临分布偏移和高维联合动作空间的挑战，传统方法易受分布外动作影响且性能不佳。

Method: 采用扩散生成模型捕捉复杂行为策略，并通过序列评分函数分解机制规范个体策略以实现分散执行。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，性能优于现有方法26.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为离线多智能体协调和均衡选择提供了新见解。

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces critical challenges
due to distributional shifts, further exacerbated by the high dimensionality of
joint action spaces and the diversity in coordination strategies and quality
among agents. Conventional approaches, including independent learning
frameworks and value decomposition methods based on pessimistic principles,
remain susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions and often yield
suboptimal performance. Through systematic analysis of prevalent offline MARL
benchmarks, we identify that this limitation primarily stems from the
inherently multimodal nature of joint collaborative policies induced by offline
data collection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage
framework: First, we employ a diffusion-based generative model to explicitly
capture the complex behavior policy, enabling accurate modeling of diverse
multi-agent coordination patterns. Second, we introduce a sequential score
function decomposition mechanism to regularize individual policies and enable
decentralized execution. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple standard offline MARL
benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 26.3\% in normalized returns. Our
approach provides new insights into offline coordination and equilibrium
selection in cooperative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This work presents an efficient decoding pipeline for neuromorphic
implantable brain-machine interfaces (Neu-iBMI), leveraging sparse neural event
data from an event-based neural sensing scheme. We introduce a tunable event
filter (EvFilter), which also functions as a spike detector (EvFilter-SPD),
significantly reducing the number of events processed for decoding by 192X and
554X, respectively. The proposed pipeline achieves high decoding performance,
up to R^2=0.73, with ANN- and SNN-based decoders, eliminating the need for
signal recovery, spike detection, or sorting, commonly performed in
conventional iBMI systems. The SNN-Decoder reduces computations and memory
required by 5-23X compared to NN-, and LSTM-Decoders, while the ST-NN-Decoder
delivers similar performance to an LSTM-Decoder requiring 2.5X fewer resources.
This streamlined approach significantly reduces computational and memory
demands, making it ideal for low-power, on-implant, or wearable iBMIs.

Abstract: As recommender systems become increasingly complex, transparency is essential
to increase user trust, accountability, and regulatory compliance.
Neuro-symbolic approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic
learning offer a promising approach toward transparent and user-centric
systems. In this work-in-progress, we investigate using fuzzy neural networks
(FNNs) as a neuro-symbolic approach for recommendations that learn logic-based
rules over predefined, human-readable atoms. Each rule corresponds to a fuzzy
logic expression, making the recommender's decision process inherently
transparent. In contrast to black-box machine learning methods, our approach
reveals the reasoning behind a recommendation while maintaining competitive
performance. We evaluate our method on a synthetic and MovieLens 1M datasets
and compare it to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Our results
demonstrate that our approach accurately captures user behavior while providing
a transparent decision-making process. Finally, the differentiable nature of
this approach facilitates an integration with other neural models, enabling the
development of hybrid, transparent recommender systems.

Motivation: 传统规则表示在模糊分类系统中难以处理未知数据特征，影响性能。

Result: 实验表明Adaptive-UCS在分类准确率上优于传统方法，且在噪声和不确定性数据中表现稳健。

Conclusion: Adaptive-UCS通过自适应规则表示显著提升了模糊分类系统的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the impact of rule representation in Michigan-style
Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) on its classification performance. A
well-representation of the rules in an LFCS is crucial for improving its
performance. However, conventional rule representations frequently need help
addressing problems with unknown data characteristics. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a supervised LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS) with a self-adaptive
rule representation mechanism, entitled Adaptive-UCS. Adaptive-UCS incorporates
a fuzzy indicator as a new rule parameter that sets the membership function of
a rule as either rectangular (i.e., crisp) or triangular (i.e., fuzzy) shapes.
The fuzzy indicator is optimized with evolutionary operators, allowing the
system to search for an optimal rule representation. Results from extensive
experiments conducted on continuous space problems demonstrate that
Adaptive-UCS outperforms other UCSs with conventional crisp-hyperrectangular
and fuzzy-hypertrapezoidal rule representations in classification accuracy.
Additionally, Adaptive-UCS exhibits robustness in the case of noisy inputs and
real-world problems with inherent uncertainty, such as missing values, leading
to stable classification performance.

Motivation: 现有通用逼近定理（UAT）未充分利用最优Q函数的贝尔曼方程结构特性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将深度残差网络的层视为作用于函数空间的神经算子，近似贝尔曼算子的作用，并利用动态规划原理分析值迭代序列的均匀正则性。

Result: 证明了网络深度与值函数优化迭代次数直接相关，且误差传播可控。

Conclusion: 该研究为DQN的逼近能力提供了与问题结构直接关联的理论支持，揭示了网络在值函数空间中的动态系统视角。

Abstract: The approximation capabilities of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are commonly
justified by general Universal Approximation Theorems (UATs) that do not
leverage the intrinsic structural properties of the optimal Q-function, the
solution to a Bellman equation. This paper establishes a UAT for a class of
DQNs whose architecture is designed to emulate the iterative refinement process
inherent in Bellman updates. A central element of our analysis is the
propagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman
operator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform
regularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically,
their uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz
assumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic
programming principles. We demonstrate that layers of a deep residual network,
conceived as neural operators acting on function spaces, can approximate the
action of the Bellman operator. The resulting approximation theorem is thus
intrinsically linked to the control problem's structure, offering a proof
technique wherein network depth directly corresponds to iterations of value
function refinement, accompanied by controlled error propagation. This
perspective reveals a dynamic systems view of the network's operation on a
space of value functions.

Conclusion: Safe-EF填补了理论与实际应用之间的鸿沟，为非平滑目标和安全性约束的联邦学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning faces severe communication bottlenecks due to the high
dimensionality of model updates. Communication compression with contractive
compressors (e.g., Top-K) is often preferable in practice but can degrade
performance without proper handling. Error feedback (EF) mitigates such issues
but has been largely restricted for smooth, unconstrained problems, limiting
its real-world applicability where non-smooth objectives and safety constraints
are critical. We advance our understanding of EF in the canonical non-smooth
convex setting by establishing new lower complexity bounds for first-order
algorithms with contractive compression. Next, we propose Safe-EF, a novel
algorithm that matches our lower bound (up to a constant) while enforcing
safety constraints essential for practical applications. Extending our approach
to the stochastic setting, we bridge the gap between theory and practical
implementation. Extensive experiments in a reinforcement learning setup,
simulating distributed humanoid robot training, validate the effectiveness of
Safe-EF in ensuring safety and reducing communication complexity.

the NREL 5MW blade was fabricated using 3D printing, and crack-type damages
were introduced at critical locations. Finite Element Analysis was employed to
predict the impact of these damages on the natural frequencies, with the
results validated through controlled hammer impact tests. Vibration data was

discriminative variables were identified using statistical analyses (ANOVA).
Machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的方法能够高效计算扩散映射嵌入，适用于训练样本内外的数据，且避免了传统方法的缺点。

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems within the field of machine learning is
dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods make it possible to
combat the so-called curse of dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data
and, in general, improve the efficiency of storing and processing large data
sets. One of the best-known nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods is
Diffusion Maps. However, despite their virtues, both Diffusion Maps and many
other manifold learning methods based on the spectral decomposition of kernel
matrices have drawbacks such as the inability to apply them to data outside the
initial set, their computational complexity, and high memory costs for large
data sets. In this work, we propose to alleviate these problems by resorting to
deep learning. Specifically, a new formulation of Diffusion Maps embedding is
offered as a solution to a certain unconstrained minimization problem and,
based on it, a cost function to train a neural network which computes Diffusion
Maps embedding -- both inside and outside the training sample -- without the
need to perform any spectral decomposition. The capabilities of this approach
are compared on different data sets, both real and synthetic, with those of
Diffusion Maps and the Nystrom method.

Conclusion: UniSymNet通过统一操作符和优化训练策略，显著提升了符号回归的性能和效率。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically
discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms
search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the
increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired
by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm.
However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary
nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to
multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to
higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic
Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and
define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we
pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide
structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to
learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting
accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression
complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard
Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.

TL;DR: 研究评估了27种前沿大语言模型在8个生物学基准测试上的表现，发现模型性能显著提升，部分模型甚至超过专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评估大语言模型在生物学领域的表现，了解其能力和局限性。

Method: 对2022年11月至2025年4月间发布的模型进行10次独立运行测试，覆盖分子生物学、遗传学等8个领域。

Result: 模型性能显著提升，部分任务表现超过专家水平，但推理链未显著提升性能，部分基准测试出现饱和。

Conclusion: 需要更复杂的评估方法以适应AI系统的快速发展。

Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on
eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning,
virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between
November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per
benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological
capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the
challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study
period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists.
Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other
challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology
subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not
substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended
reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved
performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and
the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below
100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark
data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation
methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Fisher信息约束的时间序列分类框架FIC-TSC，用于解决训练与测试集间的域偏移问题，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据在多个领域（如经济学、医疗健康）中至关重要，但域偏移问题严重影响了分类性能，现有方法在分类任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出FIC-TSC框架，利用Fisher信息作为约束，引导模型收敛至更平坦的最小值，增强对分布偏移的泛化能力。

Result: 在30个UEA多变量和85个UCR单变量数据集上验证，FIC-TSC优于14种最新方法。

Conclusion: FIC-TSC通过Fisher信息约束有效提升了时间序列分类的泛化性能，解决了域偏移问题。

Abstract: Analyzing time series data is crucial to a wide spectrum of applications,
including economics, online marketplaces, and human healthcare. In particular,
time series classification plays an indispensable role in segmenting different
phases in stock markets, predicting customer behavior, and classifying worker
actions and engagement levels. These aspects contribute significantly to the
advancement of automated decision-making and system optimization in real-world
applications. However, there is a large consensus that time series data often
suffers from domain shifts between training and test sets, which dramatically
degrades the classification performance. Despite the success of (reversible)
instance normalization in handling the domain shifts for time series regression
tasks, its performance in classification is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we
propose \textit{FIC-TSC}, a training framework for time series classification
that leverages Fisher information as the constraint. We theoretically and
empirically show this is an efficient and effective solution to guide the model
converge toward flatter minima, which enhances its generalizability to
distribution shifts. We rigorously evaluate our method on 30 UEA multivariate
and 85 UCR univariate datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over 14 recent state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单纯计算Wasserstein距离或分析传输图不足以理解其高低的原因，需要一种方法能归因到数据子组、特征或可解释子空间。

Method: 基于可解释AI的解决方案，用于归因Wasserstein距离到数据的不同组成部分。

Result: 方法在多种数据集和Wasserstein距离规格下表现出高准确性，并通过两个用例展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解Wasserstein距离的贡献因素提供了高效且准确的工具。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances provide a powerful framework for comparing data
distributions. They can be used to analyze processes over time or to detect
inhomogeneities within data. However, simply calculating the Wasserstein
distance or analyzing the corresponding transport map (or coupling) may not be
sufficient for understanding what factors contribute to a high or low
Wasserstein distance. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on
Explainable AI that allows us to efficiently and accurately attribute
Wasserstein distances to various data components, including data subgroups,
input features, or interpretable subspaces. Our method achieves high accuracy
across diverse datasets and Wasserstein distance specifications, and its
practical utility is demonstrated in two use cases.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法仅扰动过去位置，可能导致不现实的场景评估，低估模型在实际交通中的脆弱性。

Method: 提出一种新方法，扰动过去和未来状态，结合动态约束和战术行为，设计更有效的对抗攻击。

Result: 测试显示预测误差和碰撞率显著增加，定性分析暴露了模型在安全预测中未能检测潜在碰撞的弱点。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的对抗测试以提升轨迹预测模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems,
enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users.
Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is
essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current
approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding
agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical
vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of
model performance in real-world conditions.
  In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future
states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and
thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel
approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors,
enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new
performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial
trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model
revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under
adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks
can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect
potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results
underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better
evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for
autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ReLU神经网络的表达能力与深度之间的深刻联系，为理解其计算极限提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study two models of ReLU neural networks: monotone networks (ReLU$^+$) and
input convex neural networks (ICNN). Our focus is on expressivity, mostly in
terms of depth, and we prove the following lower bounds. For the maximum
function MAX$_n$ computing the maximum of $n$ real numbers, we show that
ReLU$^+$ networks cannot compute MAX$_n$, or even approximate it. We prove a
sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove
depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a
depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$
ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and
polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.

Motivation: CVRPTW问题的复杂性和传统方法的局限性促使研究者探索LLM在优化问题中的潜力，尤其是在实时紧急约束下。

Method: 采用LLM增强的Q学习框架，包括自适应两阶段训练（LLM引导探索和自主优化）和三重自校正机制（语法验证、语义验证和物理约束强制执行）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架比传统Q学习平均降低7.3%的成本，且收敛所需的训练步骤更少。

Conclusion: LLM增强的Q学习框架为CVRPTW问题提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案，尤其在实时紧急约束下表现优异。

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics
distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the
constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant
challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This
paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW
with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive
two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration
phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability,
we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical
constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the
experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the
architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a
7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer
training steps required for convergence.

Method: 提出MTL-Swin-Unet方法，结合语义分割和图像重建的表征，利用Transformer进行多任务学习。

Result: 在无协变量偏移（相同患者切片）的测试数据中，F值优于其他分类器；在有协变量偏移（不同患者切片）的测试数据中，AUC表现更优。

Conclusion: MTL-Swin-Unet在多任务学习和图像表征增强方面表现优异，尤其在处理协变量偏移时具有优势。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method MTL-Swin-Unet which is multi-task learning using

spurious-correlation problems, this method allows us to enhance the image
representation with two other image representations: representation obtained by
semantic segmentation and representation obtained by image reconstruction. In
our experiments, the proposed method outperformed in F-value measure than other
classifiers when the test data included slices from the same patient (no
covariate shift). Similarly, when the test data did not include slices from the
same patient (covariate shift setting), the proposed method outperformed in AUC
measure.

Motivation: 现代数据驱动任务中，噪声影响预测精度，传统矩阵方法在高维数据中难以保持结构和准确性，而经典张量分解方法计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 采用统计基础的奇异值阈值处理模式化矩阵化，自动提取重要成分，避免预设秩和迭代优化。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了高维噪声数据下的张量低秩近似问题，具有更高的实用性和性能优势。

Abstract: In modern data-driven tasks such as classification, optimization, and
forecasting, mitigating the effects of intrinsic noise is crucial for improving
predictive accuracy. While numerous denoising techniques have been developed,
the rising dimensionality of real-world datasets limits conventional
matrix-based methods in preserving data structure and accuracy. This challenge
has led to increasing interest in tensor-based approaches, which naturally
capture multi-way data relationships. However, classical tensor decomposition
methods (e.g., HOSVD, HOOI) typically require pre-specified ranks and iterative
optimization, making them computationally expensive and less practical. In this
work, we propose a novel low-rank approximation method for tensor data that
avoids these limitations. Our approach applies statistically grounded singular
value thresholding to mode-wise matricizations, enabling automatic extraction
of significant components without requiring prior rank specification or
iterative refinement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tensors show that
our method consistently outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimation
accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in noisy high-dimensional
settings.

Method: 引入标准化协议，量化表示的信息性、等变性、不变性和解缠性，并在图像和语音领域的不同模型上进行评估。

Result: 发现下游性能相似的模型在这些属性上表现差异显著，表明其性能机制可能不同。

Conclusion: 强调需要新的研究方向以理解和改进模型表示。

Abstract: Downstream probing has been the dominant method for evaluating model
representations, an important process given the increasing prominence of
self-supervised learning and foundation models. However, downstream probing
primarily assesses the availability of task-relevant information in the model's
latent space, overlooking attributes such as equivariance, invariance, and
disentanglement, which contribute to the interpretability, adaptability, and
utility of representations in real-world applications. While some attempts have
been made to measure these qualities in representations, no unified evaluation
framework with modular, generalizable, and interpretable metrics exists.
  In this paper, we argue for the importance of representation evaluation
beyond downstream probing. We introduce a standardized protocol to quantify
informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement of factors of
variation in model representations. We use it to evaluate representations from
a variety of models in the image and speech domains using different
architectures and pretraining approaches on identified controllable factors of
variation. We find that representations from models with similar downstream
performance can behave substantially differently with regard to these
attributes. This hints that the respective mechanisms underlying their
downstream performance are functionally different, prompting new research
directions to understand and improve representations.

Motivation: 突变测试常导致测试套件过大，增加计算开销，因此需要一种高效的方法来生成和优化测试用例。

Conclusion: PRIMG为Solidity智能合约提供了一种高效、自适应的测试用例生成方法，解决了传统突变测试的局限性。

Abstract: Mutation testing is a widely recognized technique for assessing and enhancing
the effectiveness of software test suites by introducing deliberate code
mutations. However, its application often results in overly large test suites,
as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing
computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and
Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for
incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts.
PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which
employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to
predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module,
which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine
test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness.
  We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess
its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test
cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces
test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization
module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the
generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore,
the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated
tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex
program logic.

Method: 基于SCoPE框架开发SCoPE2，优化代码预处理工具，比较两者在处理时间、内存使用及对LLM漏洞检测的影响。

Result: SCoPE2将处理时间减少97.3%，并提升LLM的F1分数。

Conclusion: SCoPE2通过改进预处理方法，显著提升了漏洞检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The application of Artificial Intelligence has become a powerful approach to
detecting software vulnerabilities. However, effective vulnerability detection
relies on accurately capturing the semantic structure of code and its
contextual relationships. Given that the same functionality can be implemented
in various forms, a preprocessing tool that standardizes code representation is
important. This tool must be efficient, adaptable across programming languages,
and capable of supporting new transformations. To address this challenge, we
build on the existing SCoPE framework and introduce SCoPE2, an enhanced version
with improved performance. We compare both versions in terms of processing time
and memory usage and evaluate their impact on a Large Language Model (LLM) for
vulnerability detection. Our results show a 97.3\% reduction in processing time
with SCoPE2, along with an improved F1-score for the LLM, solely due to the
refined preprocessing approach.

Abstract: This study focuses on the problem of path modeling in heterogeneous
information networks and proposes a multi-hop path-aware recommendation
framework. The method centers on multi-hop paths composed of various types of
entities and relations. It models user preferences through three stages: path
selection, semantic representation, and attention-based fusion. In the path
selection stage, a path filtering mechanism is introduced to remove redundant
and noisy information. In the representation learning stage, a sequential
modeling structure is used to jointly encode entities and relations, preserving
the semantic dependencies within paths. In the fusion stage, an attention
mechanism assigns different weights to each path to generate a global user
interest representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets such as
Amazon-Book show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
recommendation models across multiple evaluation metrics, including HR@10,
Recall@10, and Precision@10. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-hop
paths in capturing high-order interaction semantics and demonstrate the
expressive modeling capabilities of the framework in heterogeneous
recommendation scenarios. This method provides both theoretical and practical
value by integrating structural information modeling in heterogeneous networks
with recommendation algorithm design. It offers a more expressive and flexible
paradigm for learning user preferences in complex data environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了左截断问题，适用于其他基于数字痕迹数据的迁移研究。

Abstract: Most web and digital trace data do not include information about an
individual's nationality due to privacy concerns. The lack of data on
nationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a
left-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of
origin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can
differentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the
nationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the
detected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which
is a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6
million unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into
families of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training
data. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1
score of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level
categorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to
assign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our
results show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for
nationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries
with a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.
We found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once
we used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic
origin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has
consistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have
Chinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin. Our proposed
methods for addressing left-censoring issues are beneficial for other research
that uses digital trace data to study migration.

Motivation: 通过利用LLM丰富的语言表达能力，扩展进化博弈论和基于代理的模型，研究词汇的进化生态学。

Method: 模型中的每个代理拥有一个由LLM生成的短词或短语，并在空间环境中移动。代理相邻时，LLM根据词汇关系决定交互结果，败者的词汇被胜者替换，并可能发生词汇突变。

Result: 初步实验显示，从已知物种初始种群中，物种以渐进和间断平衡方式涌现，最终形成生态特化和适应极端环境的优势物种。长期实验验证了多样物种的共存。

Conclusion: 该模型成功展示了词汇多样性和生态适应的进化过程，为研究语言和生态系统的动态提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to
extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich
linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the
emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among
agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase)
generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become
adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on
the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by
the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We
conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would
survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of
well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated
equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse
populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as
terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically
specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted
a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and
coexistence of diverse species.

### [107] [Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05940)
*Rodrigo Diaz,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于JAX库的快速、可微分、GPU加速的模态框架，用于模拟弦、膜和板的振动，显著提升了计算效率并支持梯度逆建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模态方法在模拟非线性模型（如von Kármán板）时计算量大且不可微分，限制了逆建模和实时应用。

Method: 使用JAX库构建了一个GPU加速的模态框架，支持高效模拟和梯度逆建模。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在计算效率上显著优于CPU和GPU实现，并能从合成和实验数据中恢复物理参数。

Conclusion: 尽管参数拟合对初始化更敏感，但该方法提供了更高的可解释性和更紧凑的参数化，代码已开源。

Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are
widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However,
traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von
K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability,
limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast,
differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library,
providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling.
Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based
implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse
modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical
parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and
experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to
initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability
and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to
support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling
and sound synthesis.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在特定条件下，有限数据训练的模型甚至随机模型的表现可与大数据集训练的模型相媲美，但手工特征在某些任务中仍优于学习表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在音频数据或标注稀缺的场景下（如小众音乐传统、非流行流派或个性化音乐创作），大型深度学习模型的表现，以开发应对技术。

Method: 研究多种音乐音频表示模型在有限数据学习环境下的行为，包括不同架构、训练范式和输入时长的模型，并在5到8,000分钟的数据集上训练。

Result: 在特定条件下，有限数据或随机模型的表示表现与大数据集模型相当，但手工特征在某些任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 有限数据训练的音乐表示模型在某些情况下具有潜力，但手工特征仍不可忽视。

Abstract: Large deep-learning models for music, including those focused on learning
general-purpose music audio representations, are often assumed to require
substantial training data to achieve high performance. If true, this would pose
challenges in scenarios where audio data or annotations are scarce, such as for
underrepresented music traditions, non-popular genres, and personalized music
creation and listening. Understanding how these models behave in limited-data
scenarios could be crucial for developing techniques to tackle them.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of several music audio
representation models under limited-data learning regimes. We consider music
models with various architectures, training paradigms, and input durations, and
train them on data collections ranging from 5 to 8,000 minutes long. We
evaluate the learned representations on various music information retrieval
tasks and analyze their robustness to noise. We show that, under certain
conditions, representations from limited-data and even random models perform
comparably to ones from large-dataset models, though handcrafted features
outperform all learned representations in some tasks.

TL;DR: FlowHFT是一种基于流匹配策略的模仿学习框架，通过从多个专家模型中学习策略，适应不同市场条件，并在复杂或极端市场环境中优化表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高频交易模型依赖历史数据，假设未来市场状态类似，但在动态、多样且波动性强的实际市场中表现受限。

Method: FlowHFT采用流匹配策略，从多个专家模型中学习，并结合网格搜索微调机制优化策略。

Result: 在多种市场环境中测试，FlowHFT表现优于单一专家模型，适应性强。

Conclusion: FlowHFT通过多专家学习和动态调整，显著提升了高频交易在复杂市场中的表现。

Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously
monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds.
Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that
future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of
any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally,
these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions,
such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow,
and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic,
diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the
FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy.
FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each
proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can
adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market
state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism.
This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in
complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal.
We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow
matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling
FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably,
our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best
expert for each market condition.

TL;DR: MINT框架通过偏好优化将单模态大模型与多模态生物医学数据的领域知识对齐，显著提升了单模态模型在文本或图像输入任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量多模态生物医学数据的稀缺限制了预训练大模型在专业任务中的微调效果，MINT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MINT利用多模态机器学习模型从高质量多模态数据中提取领域知识，通过ORPO框架优化单模态模型的偏好，使其能仅用文本或图像输入完成任务。

Result: 在罕见遗传病预测和组织类型分类任务中，MINT对齐的模型性能优于传统方法及更大规模的模型。

Conclusion: MINT为通过偏好优化将单模态大模型与多模态专业知识对齐提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to
effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized
biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal
Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder
models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data
through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization
techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the
aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs
while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an
upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality
multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or
image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications:
(1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal
encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a
preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite
relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained
with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue
type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a
vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing
knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align
downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly
improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type
classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align
unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference
optimization.

in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's
execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical
precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's
performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration,
including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100).
Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通标志检测是自动驾驶中的关键任务，但现有方法在特征提取多样性和多尺度处理方面仍存在不足。

Method: MDDFNet结合动态双融合模块和Mamba骨干网络，动态双融合模块通过多分支整合空间和语义信息，Mamba骨干网络实现全局与局部特征的自适应融合。

Result: 在TT100K数据集上的实验表明，MDDFNet优于其他先进检测器，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: MDDFNet有效解决了小目标交通标志检测的挑战。

Abstract: The Detection of small objects, especially traffic signs, is a critical
sub-task in object detection and autonomous driving. Despite signficant
progress in previous research, two main challenges remain. First, the issue of
feature extraction being too singular. Second, the detection process struggles
to efectively handle objects of varying sizes or scales. These problems are
also prevalent in general object detection tasks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion
Network (MDDFNet), for traffic sign detection. The network integrates a dynamic
dual fusion module and a Mamba-based backbone to simultaneously tackle the
aforementioned issues. Specifically, the dynamic dual fusion module utilizes
multiple branches to consolidate various spatial and semantic information, thus
enhancing feature diversity. The Mamba-based backbone leverages global feature
fusion and local feature interaction, combining features in an adaptive manner
to generate unique classification characteristics. Extensive experiments
conducted on the TT100K (Tsinghua-Tencent 100K) datasets demonstrate that
MDDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors, maintaining real-time
processing capabilities of single-stage models while achieving superior
performance. This confirms the efectiveness of MDDFNet in detecting small
traffic signs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o在多模态任务中的能力，评估其在图像生成和理解方面的表现。

Method: 构建任务分类法并设计测试样本，对GPT-4o在六类任务中的表现进行定性评估。

Result: GPT-4o在通用合成任务中表现优异，但在空间推理、时间预测和专业领域任务中存在不足。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在多模态生成方面取得显著进展，但尚不适用于专业或安全关键领域。

Abstract: Recently, the visual generation ability by GPT-4o(mni) has been unlocked by
OpenAI. It demonstrates a very remarkable generation capability with excellent
multimodal condition understanding and varied task instructions. In this paper,
we aim to explore the capabilities of GPT-4o across various tasks. Inspired by
previous study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated
set of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting
from GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process
demonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks.
Thus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its
performance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks,
discriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation,
spatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These
tasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's
outputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world
concepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in
general-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image
generation, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However,
significant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial
reasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction.
Furthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios,
such as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often
exhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies. These
findings suggest that while GPT-4o marks a substantial advancement in unified
multimodal generation, there is still a long way to go before it can be
reliably applied to professional or safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Transfer是一种新型攻击方法，通过生成通用对抗扰动（UAP），揭示了CLIP模型在不同样本、任务和领域中的普遍脆弱性。其核心创新是动态选择替代模型的策略，显著提升了对抗迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP模型在多种下游任务和视觉语言模型中的应用增加，其对抗扰动的脆弱性成为关键问题。

Method: X-Transfer通过动态选择替代模型（surrogate scaling）生成UAP，实现跨数据、跨领域、跨模型和跨任务的对抗迁移性。

Result: X-Transfer在对抗迁移性方面显著优于现有方法，为CLIP模型建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: X-Transfer展示了CLIP模型的普遍脆弱性，为未来的防御研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly
adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language
models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as
a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel
attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP.
X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of
deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples,
tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super
transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain,
cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is
achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach.
Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are
computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate
scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates
from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a
new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is
publicly available in our
\href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

To improve interpretability and mimic the human visual system, we apply Gabor

Abstract: The generation of realistic medical images from text descriptions has
significant potential to address data scarcity challenges in healthcare AI
while preserving patient privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive study of
text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct
approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2)
training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM,
an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical
text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better
align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two
approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus
training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy

achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with
lower computational costs. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations by

TL;DR: ReactDance是一种基于扩散模型的新框架，用于高保真的反应性舞蹈生成，通过多尺度解耦运动表示和局部上下文采样策略，解决了现有方法在交互保真度、同步性和时间一致性上的不足。

Motivation: 现有方法在反应性舞蹈生成中过于强调全局约束和优化，忽略了局部信息（如细粒度空间交互和局部时间上下文），导致交互保真度和时间一致性不足。

Method: 提出了两种创新：1) GRFSQ（多尺度解耦运动表示），捕捉从粗粒度身体节奏到细粒度关节动态的交互语义；2) BLC（局部上下文采样策略），通过局部块因果掩码和周期性位置编码消除长序列生成中的误差累积。基于GRFSQ，实现了带有层解耦分类器自由引导的扩散模型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ReactDance超越了现有方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReactDance通过多尺度控制和局部上下文优化，显著提升了反应性舞蹈生成的交互保真度和时间一致性。

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG) produces follower movements conditioned on
guiding dancer and music while ensuring spatial coordination and temporal
coherence. However, existing methods overemphasize global constraints and
optimization, overlooking local information, such as fine-grained spatial
interactions and localized temporal context. Therefore, we present ReactDance,
a novel diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity RDG with long-term
coherence and multi-scale controllability. Unlike existing methods that
struggle with interaction fidelity, synchronization, and temporal consistency
in duet synthesis, our approach introduces two key innovations: 1)Group
Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ), a multi-scale disentangled motion
representation that captures interaction semantics from coarse body rhythms to
fine-grained joint dynamics, and 2)Blockwise Local Context (BLC), a sampling
strategy eliminating error accumulation in long sequence generation via local
block causal masking and periodic positional encoding. Built on the decoupled
multi-scale GRFSQ representation, we implement a diffusion model
withLayer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance (LDCFG), allowing granular control
over motion semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that ReactDance surpasses existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中目标定位因高变异性、低分辨率和噪声干扰（如云层和城市灯光）而极具挑战性。

Method: 引入YOLO-DCAP，包含多尺度扩张残差卷积（MDRC）块和注意力辅助空间池化（AaSP）模块，以捕捉多尺度特征并聚焦全局相关区域。

Result: YOLO-DCAP在三个卫星数据集上显著优于基准模型和现有方法，mAP50和IoU分别平均提升20.95%和32.23%。

Conclusion: YOLO-DCAP表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to
the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from
noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research,
we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW),
mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique
challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and
appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature
extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these
challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed
to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP
incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture
multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an
Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant
spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements
help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model

*Aarti Ghatkesar,Uddeshya Upadhyay,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，旨在增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对视觉内容的理解，并确保视觉信息能更有效地指导语言生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉与语言对齐方面存在不足，过于依赖语言先验，未能充分利用视觉输入。

Method: 通过分析MLLMs内部如何构建对图像区域的理解，并引入技术来增强这种能力，同时确保视觉洞察力能指导语言生成。

Result: 模型在预测视觉依赖的标记方面表现优异，并在视觉挑战性任务上提升了10个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MLLMs的多模态理解能力，实现了视觉与语言的深度对齐。

Abstract: Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central
challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail
to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our
approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual
understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this
capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the
model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual
insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior
multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream
analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well
as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

TL;DR: 本文比较了基于视觉的RAG系统（ColPali）与传统OCR-based RAG系统在不同文档质量下的表现，发现OCR-based RAG在泛化能力上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何提升RAG系统的可靠性和实用性，尤其是在处理复杂或退化文档时，避免OCR引入的错误。

Method: 系统比较了基于视觉的RAG（ColPali）与OCR-based RAG（使用Llama 3.2和Nougat OCR），并引入语义答案评估基准。

Result: 视觉RAG在特定文档上表现良好，但OCR-based RAG在泛化能力上更优。

Conclusion: 需权衡计算效率与语义准确性，为生产环境中的RAG系统选择提供指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular technique for
enhancing the reliability and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
grounding responses in external documents. Traditional RAG systems rely on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to first process scanned documents into
text. However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in
degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as
ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for
OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG
system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2
(90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional
retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark
to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that
while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on,
OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying
quality. We highlight the key trade-offs between computational efficiency and
semantic accuracy, offering practical guidance for RAG practitioners in
selecting between OCR-dependent and vision-based document retrieval systems in
production environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的基础模型HyperspectralMAE，通过双掩码策略（空间和光谱维度）预训练，结合傅里叶位置嵌入和重建目标，实现了高光谱数据的鲁棒表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像的高维特性带来了挑战，需要一种能够同时处理空间和光谱信息的模型。

Method: 采用双掩码策略（50%空间块和50%光谱带），结合傅里叶位置嵌入和MSE+SAM重建目标，预训练大规模高光谱数据。

Result: 模型在Indian Pines数据集上实现了最先进的迁移学习准确率。

Conclusion: 双掩码和波长感知嵌入提升了高光谱图像重建和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectral detail but poses unique
challenges because of its high dimensionality in both spatial and spectral
domains. We propose \textit{HyperspectralMAE}, a Transformer-based foundation
model for hyperspectral data that employs a \textit{dual masking} strategy:
during pre-training we randomly occlude 50\% of spatial patches and 50\% of
spectral bands. This forces the model to learn representations capable of
reconstructing missing information across both dimensions. To encode spectral
order, we introduce learnable harmonic Fourier positional embeddings based on
wavelength. The reconstruction objective combines mean-squared error (MSE) with
the spectral angle mapper (SAM) to balance pixel-level accuracy and
spectral-shape fidelity.
  The resulting model contains about $1.8\times10^{8}$ parameters and produces
768-dimensional embeddings, giving it sufficient capacity for transfer
learning. We pre-trained HyperspectralMAE on two large hyperspectral corpora --
NASA EO-1 Hyperion ($\sim$1\,600 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel spectra)
and DLR EnMAP Level-0 ($\sim$1\,300 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel
spectra) -- and fine-tuned it for land-cover classification on the Indian Pines
benchmark. HyperspectralMAE achieves state-of-the-art transfer-learning
accuracy on Indian Pines, confirming that masked dual-dimensional pre-training
yields robust spectral-spatial representations. These results demonstrate that
dual masking and wavelength-aware embeddings advance hyperspectral image
reconstruction and downstream analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稳定扩散先验的人脸图像压缩方法（FaSDiff），通过频率增强保持一致性，平衡了人类视觉质量和机器视觉准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸图像压缩方法在低比特率下重建质量不佳，且直接应用扩散方法会导致高频信息丢失，影响下游任务。

Method: FaSDiff结合高频敏感压缩器和低频增强模块，利用扩散先验提升视觉质量，同时保持语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明FaSDiff在人类视觉质量和机器视觉准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaSDiff通过频率增强和扩散先验，实现了高效的图像压缩，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: With the widespread application of facial image data across various domains,
the efficient storage and transmission of facial images has garnered
significant attention. However, the existing learned face image compression
methods often produce unsatisfactory reconstructed image quality at low bit
rates. Simply adapting diffusion-based compression methods to facial
compression tasks results in reconstructed images that perform poorly in
downstream applications due to insufficient preservation of high-frequency
information. To further explore the diffusion prior in facial image
compression, we propose Facial Image Compression with a Stable Diffusion Prior
(FaSDiff), a method that preserves consistency through frequency enhancement.
FaSDiff employs a high-frequency-sensitive compressor in an end-to-end
framework to capture fine image details and produce robust visual prompts.
Additionally, we introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that
disentangles low-frequency facial semantics and stably modulates the diffusion
prior alongside visual prompts. The proposed modules allow FaSDiff to leverage
diffusion priors for superior human visual perception while minimizing
performance loss in machine vision due to semantic inconsistency. Extensive
experiments show that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing
human visual quality and machine vision accuracy. The code will be released
after the paper is accepted.

research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead
to AI-driven progress within automotive UI understanding and interaction. The
applied method is cost-efficient and fine-tuned models can be deployed on

Result: 在提出的数据集和现有五个数据集上，模型以最小参数和最快推理速度取得了九项最佳性能。

Conclusion: MC4AD框架在3D工业异常检测中表现优异，并提供了新的数据集和分层质量控制策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms
and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most
anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from
internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct
the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly
detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each
point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to
simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction
Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level
representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external
corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss
and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a
highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively,
creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision
and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance
to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained
nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest
inference speed. The source is available at

Abstract: The emergence of ConvNeXt and its variants has reaffirmed the conceptual and
structural suitability of CNN-based models for vision tasks, re-establishing
them as key players in image classification in general, and in facial
expression recognition (FER) in particular. In this paper, we propose a new set
of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of
attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with
Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and
ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study
shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their
performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its
utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four
datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where
ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of
\textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.

Abstract: Functional grasp is essential for enabling dexterous multi-finger robot hands
to manipulate objects effectively. However, most prior work either focuses on
power grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on
costly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each
object functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information
from web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions,
thereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human
hand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human
hand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its
accurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from
inexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To
further expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the
initially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to
generate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train
the grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects,
including challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs,
which are underrepresented in existing datasets. The model trained on the web
HOI dataset, achieving a 75.8% success rate on seen objects and 61.8% across
all objects in simulation, with a 6.7% improvement in success rate and a 1.8x
increase in functionality ratings over baselines. Simulator-augmented data
further boosts performance from 61.8% to 83.4%. The sim-to-real transfer to the
LEAP Hand achieves a 85% success rate. Project website is at:

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models represent an important step toward
general-purpose robotic systems by integrating visual perception, language
understanding, and action execution. However, systematic evaluation of these
models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in
out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we
introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and
analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLM and VLA
models-including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA,Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST-on diverse
procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several
critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in
zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by
factors such as action representation and task complexit; (2) VLAs generally
outperform other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM
variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately,
highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt
engineering.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as clinical
assistants across various medical fields. However, specialized dermatology VLM
capable of delivering professional and detailed diagnostic analysis remains
underdeveloped, primarily due to less specialized text descriptions in current
dermatology multimodal datasets. To address this issue, we propose MM-Skin, the
first large-scale multimodal dermatology dataset that encompasses 3 imaging
modalities, including clinical, dermoscopic, and pathological and nearly 10k
high-quality image-text pairs collected from professional textbooks. In
addition, we generate over 27k diverse, instruction-following vision question
answering (VQA) samples (9 times the size of current largest dermatology VQA
dataset). Leveraging public datasets and MM-Skin, we developed SkinVL, a
dermatology-specific VLM designed for precise and nuanced skin disease
interpretation. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations of SkinVL on VQA,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and zero-shot classification tasks across 8
datasets, reveal its exceptional performance for skin diseases in comparison to
both general and medical VLM models. The introduction of MM-Skin and SkinVL
offers a meaningful contribution to advancing the development of clinical

Abstract: Automation can play a prominent role in improving efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability in infrastructure surveying and assessing construction and
compliance standards. This paper presents a framework for automation of
geometric measurements and compliance assessment using point cloud data. The
proposed approach integrates deep learning-based detection and segmentation, in
conjunction with geometric and signal processing techniques, to automate
surveying tasks. As a proof of concept, we apply this framework to
automatically evaluate the compliance of curb ramps with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), demonstrating the utility of point cloud data in survey
automation. The method leverages a newly collected, large annotated dataset of
curb ramps, made publicly available as part of this work, to facilitate robust
model training and evaluation. Experimental results, including comparison with
manual field measurements of several ramps, validate the accuracy and
reliability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to significantly
reduce manual effort and improve consistency in infrastructure assessment.
Beyond ADA compliance, the proposed framework lays the groundwork for broader
applications in infrastructure surveying and automated construction evaluation,
promoting wider adoption of point cloud data in these domains. The annotated

Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）在图像生成中表现出色，但其迭代特性导致高计算复杂度，现有缓存加速方法缺乏校正可能影响生成质量。

Method: 提出增量校准缓存方法，利用预训练模型生成校准参数，并引入通道感知SVD处理异常激活。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相似计算资源下优于现有缓存方法，减少45%计算量，IS提升12，FID仅增加0.06。

Conclusion: 增量校准缓存是一种高效且无需训练的DiT加速方法，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) models have achieved remarkable success in image
generation, thanks for their exceptional generative capabilities and
scalability. Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs)
results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment.
Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent
temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of
correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose
increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration,
where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model
itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction
failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect.
Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance
than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget.
When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45%
computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

Motivation: 木材中的结节对美观和结构完整性至关重要，传统手动标注方法效率低下，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用工业级相机采集高分辨率木材表面图像，构建大规模数据集并通过YOLOv8l进行结节检测；利用多维特征提取和三元组神经网络实现结节配对。

Result: 检测阶段mAP@0.5达到0.887，配对阶段准确率为0.85。

Abstract: Knots in wood are critical to both aesthetics and structural integrity,
making their detection and pairing essential in timber processing. However,
traditional manual annotation was labor-intensive and inefficient,
necessitating automation. This paper proposes a lightweight and fully automated
pipeline for knot detection and pairing based on machine learning techniques.
In the detection stage, high-resolution surface images of wooden boards were
collected using industrial-grade cameras, and a large-scale dataset was
manually annotated and preprocessed. After the transfer learning, the YOLOv8l
achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.887. In the pairing stage, detected knots were
analyzed and paired based on multidimensional feature extraction. A triplet
neural network was used to map the features into a latent space, enabling
clustering algorithms to identify and pair corresponding knots. The triplet
network with learnable weights achieved a pairing accuracy of 0.85. Further
analysis revealed that he distances from the knot's start and end points to the
bottom of the wooden board, and the longitudinal coordinates play crucial roles
in achieving high pairing accuracy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness
of the proposed solution, demonstrating the potential of AI in advancing wood
science and industry.

Method: 引入寄存器令牌存储全局信息，分析其对全局与局部特征关系的影响。

Result: 寄存器令牌改善了注意力图，但全局信息主导局部特征，CLS令牌也有类似问题。

Conclusion: 需谨慎解释大型ViT的注意力图，明确寄存器与CLS令牌的问题，为更可解释的视觉模型提供方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2
model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance
on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch
tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image
information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been
incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We
carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship
between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens
yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the
integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global
information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading
to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings,
we show that the CLS token itself, which can be interpreted as a register,
leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens.
Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of
large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behaviour to register

Method: 在语义区域而非像素级进行稀疏化，动态确定实例级稀疏度。

Result: 在半合成和自然图像数据集上，该方法比现有基准生成更易理解的预测。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义稀疏化和动态稀疏度，实现了更直观的可解释预测。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of machine learning models provides
valuable insights into the task, the data, and the reasons behind a model's
failures. In this work, we propose a method that performs inherently
interpretable predictions through the instance-wise sparsification of input
images. To align the sparsification with human perception, we learn the masking
in the space of semantically meaningful pixel regions rather than on
pixel-level. Additionally, we introduce an explicit way to dynamically
determine the required level of sparsity for each instance. We show empirically
on semi-synthetic and natural image datasets that our inherently interpretable
classifier produces more meaningful, human-understandable predictions than
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs)
are recognized to have significant effects on industry and business dynamics,
not least because of their impact on the preconditions for entrepreneurship.
There is still a lack of knowledge of GenAI as a theme in entrepreneurship
research. This paper presents a systematic literature review aimed at
identifying and analyzing the evolving landscape of research on the effects of
GenAI on entrepreneurship. We analyze 83 peer-reviewed articles obtained from
leading academic databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Using natural language
processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques with TF-IDF
vectorization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering,
five major thematic clusters are identified: (1) Digital Transformation and
Behavioral Models, (2) GenAI-Enhanced Education and Learning Systems, (3)
Sustainable Innovation and Strategic AI Impact, (4) Business Models and Market
Trends, and (5) Data-Driven Technological Trends in Entrepreneurship. Based on
the review, we discuss future research directions, gaps in the current
literature, as well as ethical concerns raised in the literature. We highlight
the need for more macro-level research on GenAI and LLMs as external enablers
for entrepreneurship and for research on effective regulatory frameworks that
facilitate business experimentation, innovation, and further technology
development.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了在布尔可满足性问题（SAT）中利用机器学习预测（建议）提升算法性能的方法，包括子集建议和标签建议，分别加速了决策问题的运行时间和优化问题的近似比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用机器学习提供的部分信息（建议）改进经典SAT问题的算法性能，以超越最坏情况分析的局限。

Method: 使用子集建议（随机提供部分变量）和标签建议（提供所有变量的噪声预测）两种形式，分别应用于决策和优化问题。

Result: 子集建议加速了PPSZ算法的运行时间，优化问题的近似比得到提升；标签建议在大平均度实例中实现了接近最优的近似。

Conclusion: 机器学习建议能有效提升SAT问题的算法性能，为超越最坏情况分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms are a prominent recent development in beyond
worst-case analysis. In this framework, a problem instance is provided with a
prediction (``advice'') from a machine-learning oracle, which provides partial
information about an optimal solution, and the goal is to design algorithms
that leverage this advice to improve worst-case performance. We study the
classic Boolean satisfiability (SAT) decision and optimization problems within
this framework using two forms of advice. ``Subset advice" provides a random
$\epsilon$ fraction of the variables from an optimal assignment, whereas
``label advice" provides noisy predictions for all variables in an optimal
assignment.
  For the decision problem $k$-SAT, by using the subset advice we accelerate
the exponential running time of the PPSZ family of algorithms due to Paturi,
Pudlak, Saks and Zane, which currently represent the state of the art in the
worst case. We accelerate the running time by a multiplicative factor of
$2^{-c}$ in the base of the exponent, where $c$ is a function of $\epsilon$ and
$k$. For the optimization problem, we show how to incorporate subset advice in
a black-box fashion with any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm, improving the
approximation ratio to $\alpha + (1 - \alpha)\epsilon$. Specifically, we
achieve approximations of $0.94 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$2$-SAT, $7/8 +
\Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$3$-SAT, and $0.79 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-SAT.
Moreover, for label advice, we obtain near-optimal approximation for instances
with large average degree, thereby generalizing recent results on MAX-CUT and
MAX-$2$-LIN.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了光子计算硬件在支持下一代生成式AI计算中的潜力，分析了其优势与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）对计算硬件的需求激增，传统冯·诺依曼架构难以满足，因此探索光子计算等新型硬件成为必要。

Method: 综述了集成光子神经网络架构（如马赫-曾德尔干涉仪网格、激光器、波长复用微环谐振器）及其他神经形态设备，并分析了如何将Transformer架构映射到这些硬件上。

Result: 光子计算系统在吞吐量和能效上可能远超电子处理器，但在内存和存储方面仍需突破。

Conclusion: 光子计算为LLM提供了巨大潜力，但需解决内存和存储问题以实现规模化应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary
computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume
around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may
require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration
of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This
review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation
generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network
architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers,
wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix
operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices,
including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic
synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of
two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is
reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements.
Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers)
are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping
dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then
dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and
LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We
synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods,
highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized
LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass
electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy
efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context
windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.

Motivation: AlphaFold2和ESMFold等PPM模型在预测蛋白质结构方面取得了突破，但在处理长序列时面临内存和计算资源的瓶颈，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization（AAQ）软件方法，结合多精度可重构矩阵处理单元（RMPU）和多功能向量处理单元（VVPU）的硬件设计。

Result: LightNobel相比NVIDIA A100和H100 GPU，速度提升8.44x和8.41x，能效提升37.29x和43.35x，同时减少峰值内存需求120.05x。

Conclusion: LightNobel通过软硬件协同设计，显著提升了PPM的可扩展性，为长序列蛋白质分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Structure Prediction Models (PPMs), such as
AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, have revolutionized computational biology by achieving
unprecedented accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein folding
structures. However, these models face significant scalability challenges,
particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g.,
sequence length > 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the
exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure
in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial
memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective
scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or
complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.
  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed
accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence
length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation
Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as
distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization
techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel
integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and
versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of
AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup
and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100
GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. It also reduces
the peak memory requirement up to 120.05x in PPM, enabling scalable processing
for proteins with long sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑能耗和排放占全球重要份额，需高效运营以支持电网稳定性，但大规模集中运营中融入居住者信息仍具挑战。

Method: 提出OccuEMBED框架，包含概率占用生成器和基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks的可控负载分解器，结合深度学习模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中表现优异，占用推断F1分数高于0.8，连续占用比RMSE在0.1-0.2之间。

Conclusion: OccuEMBED为规模化居住者中心建筑管理系统提供了坚实基础，应对能源系统挑战。

Abstract: Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and
emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids
become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide
flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in
enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must
prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets.
However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized
building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate
the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy
and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building
energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at
scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy
inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a
probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable
load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design
embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships
into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to
demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared
to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1
scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for
continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates
with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze
system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model
lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management
systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.

Conclusion: 虚拟传感器为低成本空气质量监测提供了潜力，有助于气候和健康干预。

Abstract: Air pollution is a significant global health risk, contributing to millions
of premature deaths annually. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a harmful pollutant,
disproportionately affects urban areas where monitoring networks are often
sparse. We propose a novel method for predicting NO2 concentrations at
unmonitored locations using transfer learning with satellite and meteorological
data. Leveraging the GraphSAGE framework, our approach integrates
autoregression and transfer learning to enhance predictive accuracy in
data-scarce regions like Bristol. Pre-trained on data from London, UK, our
model achieves a 8.6% reduction in Normalised Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE)
and a 32.6% reduction in Gradient RMSE compared to a baseline model. This work
demonstrates the potential of virtual sensors for cost-effective air quality
monitoring, contributing to actionable insights for climate and health
interventions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新型上下文学习（ICL）框架，用于编码多输入多输出（MIMO）系统中的软输入软输出信道均衡。通过提示增强技术，结合解码器反馈的外在信息，ICL模型能够迭代优化符号估计。两种基于Transformer和状态空间架构的模型在仿真中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性假设在低分辨率量化等情况下失效，需要一种更灵活的信道均衡方法。

Method: 提出ICL框架，利用提示增强技术结合解码器反馈信息，开发了基于Transformer和状态空间架构的两种模型。

Result: 仿真显示ICL均衡器在传统方法失效时表现更优，Transformer模型在训练数据有限时表现更好，状态空间模型在资源受限场景下更高效。

Conclusion: ICL框架为信道均衡提供了新的解决方案，尤其在非线性场景下表现突出。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired
by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel
equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The
proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from
a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of
prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder
output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol
estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants,
based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and
evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear
assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization,
ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even
when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results
also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training
diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in
resource-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 解决毫米波通信中因波束漂移导致的波束失败问题，利用感知技术实现低开销的波束管理。

Method: 引入多波束方案，结合DRL优化波束分配策略，并与基于AoD的启发式方法进行比较。

Result: DRL辅助方法在吞吐量上显著优于传统波束扫描和AoD方法，且对不同用户速度具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DRL辅助的波束分配方法能有效提升毫米波通信性能，无需用户反馈或先验状态信息。

Abstract: Mobile users are prone to experience beam failure due to beam drifting in
millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Sensing can help alleviate beam
drifting with timely beam changes and low overhead since it does not need user
feedback. This work studies the problem of optimizing sensing-aided
communication by dynamically managing beams allocated to mobile users. A
multi-beam scheme is introduced, which allocates multiple beams to the users
that need an update on the angle of departure (AoD) estimates and a single beam
to the users that have satisfied AoD estimation precision. A deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) assisted method is developed to optimize the beam allocation
policy, relying only upon the sensing echoes. For comparison, a heuristic
AoD-based method using approximated Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for
allocation is also presented. Both methods require neither user feedback nor
prior state evolution information. Results show that the DRL-assisted method
achieves a considerable gain in throughput than the conventional beam sweeping
method and the AoD-based method, and it is robust to different user speeds.

TL;DR: AgentXploit是一个黑盒模糊测试框架，用于自动发现和利用LLM代理中的间接提示注入漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的强大规划和推理能力带来了安全风险，尤其是间接提示注入攻击。

Method: 构建高质量初始种子语料库，使用MCTS算法迭代优化输入以发现漏洞。

Result: 在AgentDojo和VWA-adv基准测试中，攻击成功率分别达到71%和70%，显著优于基线攻击。

Conclusion: AgentXploit展示了强大的跨任务和跨LLM的迁移能力，并在实际环境中成功误导代理。

Abstract: The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of
leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex
environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical
security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that
compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual
information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic
black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover
and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM
agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus,
then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering
agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo
and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based
on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of
baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across
unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses.
Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments,
successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including
malicious sites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在设备端部署的增加，压缩技术（如量化）可能带来公平性、伦理和隐私风险，甚至导致模型直接响应有害查询。因此，需要一种实时防护机制来确保安全性。

Method: 提出LiteLMGuard（LLMG），一种模型无关的提示防护机制，通过深度学习分类任务（ELECTRA模型）判断查询是否应由SLM回答。使用自建数据集Answerable-or-Not进行训练和评估。

Result: LLMG在有害提示防御中表现优异，覆盖87%以上的有害查询（包括直接指令和越狱攻击），过滤准确率达94%，平均延迟135毫秒，对用户体验影响极小。

Conclusion: LLMG为量化SLMs提供了一种高效、低延迟的实时防护方案，显著提升了模型的安全性和用户信任度。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the
development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to
enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs
offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and
improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device
environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like
quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy
risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly,
without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and
trust concerns.
  To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard
that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally,
our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be
seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying
architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning
(DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic
understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using
our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL
models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability
classification accuracy.
  Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against
over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak
attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open
Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without
adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG
achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average
latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.

Result: 提出了SL中攻击与防御的综合分类法，并识别了当前研究的空白和挑战。

Conclusion: SL的安全问题仍需进一步研究，未来应关注攻击与防御的系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed deep
learning, allowing resource-constrained clients to offload portions of their
model computation to servers while maintaining collaborative learning. However,
recent research has demonstrated that SL remains vulnerable to a range of
privacy and security threats, including information leakage, model inversion,
and adversarial attacks. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, a
systematic understanding of the attack landscape and corresponding
countermeasures is still lacking. In this study, we present a comprehensive
taxonomy of attacks and defenses in SL, categorizing them along three key
dimensions: employed strategies, constraints, and effectiveness. Furthermore,
we identify key open challenges and research gaps in SL based on our
systematization, highlighting potential future directions.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其在推理服务（如ChatGPT）中的广泛部署引发了用户敏感数据泄露的担忧。现有解决方案在效率、隐私和效用之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 提出Cape机制，结合差分隐私和上下文感知提示扰动，引入混合效用函数以更好地捕捉标记相似性，并提出桶化采样机制处理大采样空间。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Cape在隐私-效用权衡方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Cape通过改进的隐私保护机制，为LLMs的推理服务提供了更优的隐私-效用平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity due to their
remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, despite
their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns
about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing
solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such
risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow
this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based
on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved
privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function
that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a
bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead
to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along
with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility
trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLAM的连续潜在动作模型，用于从无标签的观察数据中学习机器人策略，显著提升了复杂连续控制任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习需要大量标注动作的专家演示数据，成本高昂且限制了训练规模。利用无标签观察数据（如视频演示）学习潜在动作标签是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 设计了CLAM模型，采用连续潜在动作标签而非离散表示，并联合训练动作解码器，确保潜在动作空间能轻松映射到真实动作。

Result: 在DMControl（运动）和MetaWorld（操纵）基准测试及真实WidowX机器人上，CLAM显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: CLAM无需专家标注数据，仅需少量非最优示例即可学习高性能策略，为复杂机器人任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large
amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally
limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this
bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from
video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way.
However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot
tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models
(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to
solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)
using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and
(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space
can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.
Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,
enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled
expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl
(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot
arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods,
remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best
baseline. Videos and code can be found at clamrobot.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自适应压力测试（AST）和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来检测大型语言模型（LLMs）幻觉的方法，以解决其在安全关键场景中的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在决策任务中表现出色，但其幻觉行为可能带来风险，尤其是在安全关键场景中。现有方法通过多样本不一致性检测幻觉，但缺乏高效性。

Method: 通过AST和MCTS搜索提示扰动的空间，生成能引发模型高不确定性的场景和提示。

Result: 实验表明，离线分析可用于运行时自动生成影响模型不确定性的提示，并支持实时信任评估。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测LLMs的幻觉行为，提升其在安全关键场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in
generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control and
prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs
poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in
safety-critical scenarios. Existing black-box methods often detect
hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of
these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing
detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a
confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case
study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing
sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. We then
propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt
perturbations using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that
cause language models to act with high uncertainty. By generating MCTS prompt
perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show that offline analyses can
be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model
uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM.

Conclusion: 该研究为资源受限的空间平台提供了更快的实时优化方法。

Abstract: Although widely used in commercial and industrial robotics, trajectory
optimization has seen limited use in space applications due to its high
computational demands. In this work, we present flight results from experiments
with the Astrobee free-flying robot on board the International Space Station

optimization while preserving theoretical solver guarantees. To the best of the
authors' knowledge, this is the first-ever demonstration of learning-based
control on the ISS. Our approach leverages the GuSTO sequential convex
programming framework and uses a neural network, trained offline, to map
problem parameters to effective initial ``warm-start'' trajectories, paving the
way for faster real-time optimization on resource-constrained space platforms.

Conclusion: CityNavAgent通过LLM赋能和模块化设计，显著提升了空中VLN的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret
natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges
as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D
spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN
agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle
in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the
exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work,
we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent
that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN.
Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that
decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels.
The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with
different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing
historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify
navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement.
Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of
CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments. The code is

Result: 开放环精度提升不一定带来更好的闭环驾驶性能；模型参数减少86%时性能仍可能相当或更好。

Conclusion: 运动预测模型的性能评估需考虑闭环驾驶行为，参数减少可能不会显著影响性能。

Abstract: Fueled by motion prediction competitions and benchmarks, recent years have
seen the emergence of increasingly large learning based prediction models, many
with millions of parameters, focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy
by mere centimeters. However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such
improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous
driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between
state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that
higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop
driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of
predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore,
we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that
in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even
superior closed-loop driving performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: Developing generalist agents that can operate across diverse tasks,
environments, and physical embodiments is a grand challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. In this work, we focus on the axis of embodiment and
investigate embodiment scaling laws$\unicode{x2013}$the hypothesis that
increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen
ones. Using robot locomotion as a test bed, we procedurally generate a dataset
of $\sim$1,000 varied embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and
hexapods, and train generalist policies capable of handling diverse observation
and action spaces on random subsets. We find that increasing the number of
training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, and scaling
embodiments is more effective in enabling embodiment-level generalization than
scaling data on small, fixed sets of embodiments. Notably, our best policy,
trained on the full dataset, zero-shot transfers to novel embodiments in the
real world, such as Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward
general embodied intelligence, with potential relevance to adaptive control for
configurable robots, co-design of morphology and control, and beyond.

generalizability comparatively, we conducted experiments with models from both

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量动作标注数据，局限于单一物理规格，难以在不同具身和环境间迁移知识。

Method: 提出UniVLA框架，从视频中提取任务中心化动作表示，结合语言指令和DINO特征空间建立潜在动作模型。

Result: 在多个操作和导航基准测试及实际机器人部署中取得最优性能，计算和数据需求显著低于OpenVLA。

Conclusion: UniVLA展示了高效、可扩展的机器人策略学习潜力，支持异构数据（包括人类视频）的持续性能提升。

Abstract: A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments.
However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data
to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single
physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across
different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we
propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment
vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive
task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model.
This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments
and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we
incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within
the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist
policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action
decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and
navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves
superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute
and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed
as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the
training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate
scalable and efficient robot policy learning.

Conclusion: MBRA框架和LogoNav策略通过利用被动数据显著提升了视觉导航的泛化能力，为机器人导航提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a
significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of
large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by
researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy
generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively
collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation
data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or
missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework
that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or
generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data
is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on
visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using
MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust
navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and
outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a
fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents,
validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even
amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.

Conclusion: 通过高效学习与泛化，该论文为实现智能机器人助手无缝融入日常场景迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: This dissertation considers Open-world Robot Manipulation, a manipulation
problem where a robot must generalize or quickly adapt to new objects, scenes,
or tasks for which it has not been pre-programmed or pre-trained. This
dissertation tackles the problem using a methodology of efficient sensorimotor
learning. The key to enabling efficient sensorimotor learning lies in
leveraging regular patterns that exist in limited amounts of demonstration
data. These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient
learning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new
perspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of
regularity. Building upon this notion, we introduce three major contributions.
First, we introduce methods that endow robots with object-centric priors,
allowing them to learn generalizable, closed-loop sensorimotor policies from a
small number of teleoperation demonstrations. Second, we introduce methods that
constitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate
manipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations. Last but not least, we
introduce methods that enable robots to identify reusable skills from their
past experiences, resulting in systems that can continually imitate multiple
tasks in a sequential manner. Altogether, the contributions of this
dissertation help lay the groundwork for building general-purpose personal
robots that can quickly adapt to new situations or tasks with low-cost data
collection and interact easily with humans. By enabling robots to learn and
generalize from limited data, this dissertation takes a step toward realizing
the vision of intelligent robotic assistants that can be seamlessly integrated
into everyday scenarios.

Motivation: 当前人形机器人研究在徒步任务中存在局限性：运动技能缺乏长期目标或情境感知，而语义导航忽略了真实世界的体现和地形变化。

Method: LEGO-H框架包含两个技术创新：1）时间视觉变换器变体，结合分层强化学习，预测未来局部目标以指导运动；2）潜在关节运动模式表示，结合分层度量学习，实现从特权训练到实际执行的平滑策略转移。

Result: 实验表明LEGO-H在多样化模拟小径和机器人形态中表现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 徒步任务成为体现自主性的有力测试平台，LEGO-H为未来人形机器人发展提供了基准。

Abstract: Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive
decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains
fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills
without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation
overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose
training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill
development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We
develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid
robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical
innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals
to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed
navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with
hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable
smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These
components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges
without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied
simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and
robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy
and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在复杂环境中表现不佳，无法维持Eikonal方程的关键性质（如最优值函数和测地距离）。

Method: 通过时间差分学习避免局部极小值，并结合度量学习保持Eikonal方程的测地性质，同时在有限区域内强制执行Bellman最优性原则。

Result: 该方法在复杂环境和未见环境中显著优于现有自监督学习方法，适用于2至12自由度的机器人配置。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了复杂环境中的运动规划性能。

Abstract: The motion planning problem involves finding a collision-free path from a
robot's starting to its target configuration. Recently, self-supervised
learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without
requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for
training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these
methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key
properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and
geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the
Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex
and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of
optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid
spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the
Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in
handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with
robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).

Abstract: With robots increasingly integrating into human environments, understanding
and predicting human motion is essential for safe and efficient interactions.
Modern human motion and activity prediction approaches require high quality and
quantity of data for training and evaluation, usually collected from motion
capture systems, onboard or stationary sensors. Setting up these systems is
challenging due to the intricate setup of hardware components, extensive
calibration procedures, occlusions, and substantial costs. These constraints
make deploying such systems in new and large environments difficult and limit
their usability for in-the-wild measurements. In this paper we investigate the
possibility to apply the novel Ultra-Wideband (UWB) localization technology as
a scalable alternative for human motion capture in crowded and occlusion-prone
environments. We include additional sensing modalities such as eye-tracking,
onboard robot LiDAR and radar sensors, and record motion capture data as ground
truth for evaluation and comparison. The environment imitates a museum setup,
with up to four active participants navigating toward random goals in a natural
way, and offers more than 130 minutes of multi-modal data. Our investigation
provides a step toward scalable and accurate motion data collection beyond
vision-based systems, laying a foundation for evaluating sensing modalities
like UWB in larger and complex environments like warehouses, airports, or
convention centers.

Conclusion: TAP是一个通用且可扩展的框架，有望推动机器人主动触觉感知的发展。

Abstract: Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the
properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception
has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks
such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This
work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that
leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to
address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP
integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified
optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and
decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in
principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across
diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving
haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST
haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These
findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable
framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统修图工具操作复杂，而生成式编辑可能改变对象身份。研究旨在结合两者的优势，利用MLLM提供可解释且可控的修图方案。

Method: 训练MLLM通过视觉谜题理解图像处理操作，并基于专家编辑照片合成推理数据集，用于微调模型。

Result: MLLM能够生成可理解的修图序列，保留对象细节和分辨率，优于现有生成式和程序化方法。

Conclusion: MLLM在修图任务中表现出色，提供了可解释且用户可控的编辑方案，优于传统和生成式方法。

Abstract: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs.
Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible
to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in
unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional
procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,
Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.
Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual
procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In
this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to
critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them
with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate
that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing
operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.
Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit
sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we
synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits
and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize
reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by
construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and
resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a
variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and
identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural
alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文首次应用机器学习管道cecilia分析五颗金属污染He大气白矮星的物理参数和光球组成，通过联合贝叶斯拟合其光谱数据，测量了多种元素丰度，结果与CI球粒陨石一致，并发现氧过量现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习技术高效分析缺乏详细元素丰度数据的金属污染白矮星，以揭示其污染物来源及组成。

Method: 采用联合迭代贝叶斯拟合方法，结合SDSS和Keck/ESI光谱数据，测量白矮星大气中的多种元素丰度。

Result: 成功测量了2至6种元素的丰度，精度与传统方法相当（约0.20 dex）；污染物组成与CI球粒陨石一致，部分白矮星存在显著氧过量。

Conclusion: cecilia为未来大规模光谱数据分析提供了高效工具，有助于统计研究系外行星物质组成。

Abstract: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline
$\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric
composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without
well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint
and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and
$\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range
from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at
least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a
predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques
($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy
elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously
exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all
systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely
consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also
find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for
SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of
oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical
surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community,
$\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs,
therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar
compositions.

### [165] [Structure & Quality: Conceptual and Formal Foundations for the Mind-Body Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05481)
*Ryan Williams*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 本文从结构与质量的关系角度探讨意识难题，提出信息论方法量化二者互确定性，并建立Q-S空间分析其关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意识研究区分物理与心理，本文探索更基础的结构与质量关系，为意识问题提供新视角。

Method: 开发信息论方法量化结构与质量互确定性，提出Q-S空间分析其关系，并分类五种可能关系。

Result: 通过概念和形式模型展示五种关系，探讨其对功能主义、涌现论等哲学观点的本体论意义。

Conclusion: 建立框架为演化中的质量系统提供理论约束，为后续研究（如《Qualia & Natural Selection》）奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the hard problem of consciousness from a different
perspective. Instead of drawing distinctions between the physical and the
mental, an exploration of a more foundational relationship is examined: the
relationship between structure and quality.
  Information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual
determinability between structure and quality, including a novel Q-S space for
analyzing fidelity between the two domains. This novel space naturally points
toward a five-fold categorization of possible relationships between structural
and qualitative properties, illustrating each through conceptual and formal
models.
  The ontological implications of each category are examined, shedding light on
debates around functionalism, emergentism, idealism, panpsychism, and neutral
monism.
  This new line of inquiry has established a framework for deriving theoretical
constraints on qualitative systems undergoing evolution that is explored in my
companion paper, Qualia & Natural Selection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受神经科学启发的自主AI推理框架，旨在通过模拟人脑功能提升智能系统的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主AI的推理方法缺乏与生物推理的明确对比和理论基础，限制了其通用性和认知对齐。

Method: 提出基于神经科学的统一框架，涵盖感知、维度、逻辑和交互四种核心推理类型，并应用于现有AI方法的分类与分析。

Result: 框架为AI推理提供了理论基础和实践路径，支持构建更具通用性和认知对齐的智能体。

Conclusion: 通过结合认知神经科学与AI，论文为智能系统的推理能力发展提供了新方向和方法。

Abstract: Autonomous AI is no longer a hard-to-reach concept, it enables the agents to
move beyond executing tasks to independently addressing complex problems,
adapting to change while handling the uncertainty of the environment. However,
what makes the agents truly autonomous? It is agentic reasoning, that is
crucial for foundation models to develop symbolic logic, statistical
correlations, or large-scale pattern recognition to process information, draw
inferences, and make decisions. However, it remains unclear why and how
existing agentic reasoning approaches work, in comparison to biological
reasoning, which instead is deeply rooted in neural mechanisms involving
hierarchical cognition, multimodal integration, and dynamic interactions. In
this work, we propose a novel neuroscience-inspired framework for agentic
reasoning. Grounded in three neuroscience-based definitions and supported by
mathematical and biological foundations, we propose a unified framework
modeling reasoning from perception to action, encompassing four core types,
perceptual, dimensional, logical, and interactive, inspired by distinct
functional roles observed in the human brain. We apply this framework to
systematically classify and analyze existing AI reasoning methods, evaluating
their theoretical foundations, computational designs, and practical
limitations. We also explore its implications for building more generalizable,
cognitively aligned agents in physical and virtual environments. Finally,
building on our framework, we outline future directions and propose new
neural-inspired reasoning methods, analogous to chain-of-thought prompting. By
bridging cognitive neuroscience and AI, this work offers a theoretical
foundation and practical roadmap for advancing agentic reasoning in intelligent
systems. The associated project can be found at:

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个基于聊天机器人的系统，通过自我披露技术提高西班牙年轻人对某些心理健康问题的认识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过聊天机器人帮助青少年（12-18岁）更好地了解和关注心理健康问题。

Method: 系统结合封闭式和开放式对话，通过GPT-3语言模型引导用户讨论特定心理健康问题。

Result: 结果显示该系统对年轻人有吸引力，并能提高他们对心理健康问题的认识。

Conclusion: 基于聊天机器人的系统在青少年心理健康教育中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a chatbot-based system to engage young Spanish people in
the awareness of certain mental disorders through a self-disclosure technique.
The study was carried out in a population of teenagers aged between 12 and 18
years. The dialogue engine mixes closed and open conversations, so certain
controlled messages are sent to focus the chat on a specific disorder, which
will change over time. Once a set of trial questions is answered, the system
can initiate the conversation on the disorder under the focus according to the
user's sensibility to that disorder, in an attempt to establish a more
empathetic communication. Then, an open conversation based on the GPT-3
language model is initiated, allowing the user to express themselves with more
freedom. The results show that these systems are of interest to young people
and could help them become aware of certain mental disorders.

### [168] [Would You Rely on an Eerie Agent? A Systematic Review of the Impact of the Uncanny Valley Effect on Trust in Human-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05543)
*Ahdiyeh Alipour,Tilo Hartmann,Maryam Alimardani*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了‘恐怖谷效应’（UVE）对人类信任人工代理的影响，总结了现有研究的方法、局限与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工代理在日常生活中的普及，理解人类对其信任的感知至关重要，而UVE是影响这种感知的关键挑战之一。现有研究对UVE与信任的定义和操作化不一致，缺乏系统理解。

Method: 遵循PRISMA指南，系统检索了53项实证研究，分析了代理类型、交互方式、测量方法及关键发现。

Result: 多数研究依赖静态图像或假设场景，缺乏实时交互，且主要使用主观信任测量。本文提出了一个分类信任测量方法的新框架。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统梳理UVE与信任关系的研究，为未来研究提供了基础，并深化了对二者相互作用的理解。

Abstract: Trust is a fundamental component of human-agent interaction. With the
increasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to
understand how people perceive and trust these agents. One of the key
challenges affecting this perception is the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), where
increasingly human-like artificial beings can be perceived as eerie or
repelling. Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research
varies widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized.
This inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what
conditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of
their relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact
of the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns,
limitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA
guidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that
investigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes.
Studies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types
of agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key
findings. The results of our systematic review reveal that most studies rely on
static images or hypothetical scenarios with limited real-time interaction, and
the majority use subjective trust measures. This review offers a novel
framework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the
best-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE. As the first
systematic attempt to map the intersection of UVE and trust, this review
contributes to a deeper understanding of their interplay and offers a
foundation for future research. Keywords: the uncanny valley effect, trust,
human-likeness, affinity response, human-agent interaction

### [169] [Extending Stress Detection Reproducibility to Consumer Wearable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05694)
*Ohida Binte Amin,Varun Mishra,Tinashe M. Tapera,Robert Volpe,Aarti Sathyanarayana*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究评估了消费级可穿戴设备在压力检测中的表现，发现研究级设备（如Biopac MP160）表现最佳，但消费级设备（如Garmin Forerunner 55s）在某些场景下表现接近研究级设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一数据集，缺乏对模型在不同设备、人群或研究条件下可重复性的评估。

Method: 通过实验室环境下的标准化压力诱导任务，比较研究级设备（Biopac MP160、Polar H10、Empatica E4）与消费级设备（Garmin Forerunner 55s）的压力检测性能。

Result: Biopac MP160表现最佳，但消费级设备Garmin Forerunner 55s在部分场景中表现接近研究级设备。结合HRV和EDA可提升压力检测效果。

Conclusion: 消费级设备在压力检测中具有潜力，但硬件与模型的兼容性仍需优化。

Abstract: Wearable sensors are widely used to collect physiological data and develop
stress detection models. However, most studies focus on a single dataset,
rarely evaluating model reproducibility across devices, populations, or study
conditions. We previously assessed the reproducibility of stress detection
models across multiple studies, testing models trained on one dataset against
others using heart rate (with R-R interval) and electrodermal activity (EDA).
In this study, we extended our stress detection reproducibility to consumer
wearable sensors. We compared validated research-grade devices, to consumer
wearables - Biopac MP160, Polar H10, Empatica E4, to the Garmin Forerunner 55s,
assessing device-specific stress detection performance by conducting a new
stress study on undergraduate students. Thirty-five students completed three
standardized stress-induction tasks in a lab setting. Biopac MP160 performed
the best, being consistent with our expectations of it as the gold standard,
though performance varied across devices and models. Combining heart rate
variability (HRV) and EDA enhanced stress prediction across most scenarios.
However, Empatica E4 showed variability; while HRV and EDA improved stress
detection in leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluations (AUROC up to 0.953),
device-specific limitations led to underperformance when tested with our
pre-trained stress detection tool (AUROC 0.723), highlighting generalizability
challenges related to hardware-model compatibility. Garmin Forerunner 55s
demonstrated strong potential for real-world stress monitoring, achieving the
best mental arithmetic stress detection performance in LOSO (AUROC up to 0.961)
comparable to research-grade devices like Polar H10 (AUROC 0.954), and Empatica
E4 (AUROC 0.905 with HRV-only model and AUROC 0.953 with HRV+EDA model), with
the added advantage of consumer-friendly wearability for free-living contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）训练中的拖尾问题，通过五个月的跟踪数据分析了拖尾现象的频率、影响、模式及潜在原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练对分布式计算要求极高，拖尾问题可能导致训练停滞，但原因复杂且非单纯硬件故障。论文旨在全面研究拖尾问题及其影响。

Method: 采用假设分析方法，模拟无拖尾场景并与实际情况对比，分析拖尾的频率、性能影响、时空模式及潜在原因。

Result: 研究发现拖尾问题对训练任务的影响频率较高，且存在时空模式，潜在原因多样。

Conclusion: 拖尾问题是LLM训练中的关键瓶颈，需进一步优化以减少其对性能的影响。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed
computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent
synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible
to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At
ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware
failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to
present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a
five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core
methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any
stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the
following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what
effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or
spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态贝叶斯说服定价机制（DaringFed），用于在线联邦学习（OFL）中的激励机制设计，解决了动态双边不完全信息（TII）下的资源分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线联邦学习（OFL）需要激励客户端参与训练，但由于动态双边不完全信息（TII）的存在，服务器和客户端无法完全了解对方的资源情况，导致激励机制设计困难。

Method: 论文将服务器与客户端的交互建模为贝叶斯说服博弈中的动态信号和定价分配问题，证明了贝叶斯说服纳什均衡的存在性，并推导了最优设计。

Result: 实验表明，DaringFed在真实数据集上优化了16.99%的准确性和收敛速度，在合成数据集上提高了服务器效用达12.6%。

Conclusion: DaringFed是一种有效的激励机制，能够在动态双边不完全信息下优化在线联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Online Federated Learning (OFL) is a real-time learning paradigm that
sequentially executes parameter aggregation immediately for each random
arriving client. To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to
offer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption.
However, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the
dynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning
resources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing
computational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time
communication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to
participate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we
design a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated
learning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the
interaction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing
allocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the
existence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the
optimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further
analyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under
TII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that
DaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments
with synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and
the effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to
12.6%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的两阶段方法，通过领域定义语句生成可解释的自然语言用户画像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像技术存在可迁移性差、特征不可解释、依赖大量标注数据或固定类别等问题，亟需一种灵活、可适应且可解释的新方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）半监督过滤结合领域知识库；2）生成抽象（合成描述）和抽取（代表性推文选择）的用户画像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在波斯政治Twitter数据集上显著优于现有LLM和传统方法，提升9.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过LLM的固有知识生成灵活、可适应且可解释的用户画像，减少了对大量标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks
like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring,
and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including
tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation
learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability,
produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on
rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large
language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements,
which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain
as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs
semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates
both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative
tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with
minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while
reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates
interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data
into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for
downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X)
dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation.
Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in
creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.

Result: 模型在重叠社区检测中优于现有方法（NMI和F1分数提升），且在60%特征噪声下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 整合属性语义和结构模式对复杂网络中的社区发现至关重要。

Abstract: Community detection in networks with overlapping structures remains a
significant challenge, particularly in noisy real-world environments where
integrating topology, node attributes, and prior information is critical. To
address this, we propose a semi-supervised graph autoencoder that combines
graph multi-head attention and modularity maximization to robustly detect
overlapping communities. The model learns semantic representations by fusing
structural, attribute, and prior knowledge while explicitly addressing noise in
node features. Key innovations include a noise-resistant architecture and a
semantic semi-supervised design optimized for community quality through
modularity constraints. Experiments demonstrate superior performance the model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in overlapping community detection
(improvements in NMI and F1-score) and exhibits exceptional robustness to
attribute noise, maintaining stable performance under 60\% feature corruption.
These results highlight the importance of integrating attribute semantics and
structural patterns for accurate community discovery in complex networks.

Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable
and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they
are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy
demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational
costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy
management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is
essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate
renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently
demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids,
providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined
benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of
microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in
achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out
several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS,
namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain
technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability,
data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of
future AI-based EMS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人机交互（HITL）的人工智能框架，用于优化HVAC系统性能，通过实时用户反馈和电价波动响应，实现节能与舒适平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统无法动态适应电价变化和用户舒适需求，导致高能耗和低舒适度，亟需智能解决方案。

Method: 结合用户实时反馈和强化学习，动态调整HVAC运行，无需预定义参数。

Result: 模拟显示，该方法显著降低能耗成本，同时保持或提升用户舒适度。

Conclusion: 该框架为HVAC系统提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，兼顾个性化舒适与经济环保目标。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for
approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of
the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy
efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant
comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These
systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity
market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy
costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by
incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity
prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about
occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing
user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement
learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs
in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand
response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method
achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while
maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach
ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings,
offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic
and environmental goals.

assesses static, voltage, transient, and small-signal stability, improving both
accuracy and interpretability with respect to the most state of the art machine

Abstract: Modular, Jacobi, and mock-modular forms serve as generating functions for BPS
black hole degeneracies. By training feed-forward neural networks on Fourier
coefficients of automorphic forms derived from the Dedekind eta function,
Eisenstein series, and Jacobi theta functions, we demonstrate that machine
learning techniques can accurately predict modular weights from truncated
expansions. Our results reveal strong performance for negative weight modular
and quasi-modular forms, particularly those arising in exact black hole
counting formulae, with lower accuracy for positive weights and more
complicated combinations of Jacobi theta functions. This study establishes a
proof of concept for using machine learning to identify how data is organized
in terms of modular symmetries in gravitational systems and suggests a pathway
toward automated detection and verification of symmetries in quantum gravity.

Result: 与FedAvg和FedSGD两种基线算法相比，FedAvgen表现出更优的性能。

Conclusion: FedAvgen通过遗传进化思想优化联邦学习的全局模型聚合，为设备多样性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To improve business efficiency and minimize costs, Artificial Intelligence
(AI) practitioners have adopted a shift from formulating models from scratch
towards sharing pretrained models. The pretrained models are then aggregated
into a global model with higher generalization capabilities, which is
afterwards distributed to the client devices. This approach is known as
federated learning and inherently utilizes different techniques to select the
candidate client models averaged to obtain the global model. This approach, in
the case of communication systems, faces challenges arising from the
existential diversity in device profiles. The multiplicity in profiles
motivates our conceptual assessment of a metaheuristic algorithm (FedAvgen),
which relates each pretrained model with its weight space as metadata, to a
phenotype and genotype, respectively. This parent-child genetic evolution
characterizes the global averaging step in federated learning. We then compare
the results of our approach to two widely adopted baseline federated learning
algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Gradient
Descent (FedSGD).

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和EAs的框架能够有效提升复杂场景下的推理和搜索能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning
is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often
getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability
of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces
makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization
methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied
to complex problems.
  To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations,
particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly
efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility
with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid
individuals.
  Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables
a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the
generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results
demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.

Abstract: The circadian rhythm plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes,
and its disruption is linked to various health issues. Identifying small
molecules that influence the circadian period is essential for developing
targeted therapies. This study explores the use of evolutionary optimization
techniques to enhance the classification of these molecules. We applied an
evolutionary algorithm to optimize feature selection and classification
performance. Several machine learning classifiers were employed, and
performance was evaluated using accuracy and generalization ability. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed evolutionary optimization method
improves classification accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to baseline
models. Additionally, the use of variance in accuracy as a penalty factor may
enhance the model's reliability for real-world applications. Our study confirms
that evolutionary optimization is an effective strategy for classifying small
molecules regulating the circadian rhythm. The proposed approach not only
improves predictive performance but also ensures a more robust model.

Abstract: Processes of evidence accumulation for motor control contribute to the
ecological validity of driver models. According to established theories of
cognition, drivers make control adjustments when a process of accumulation of
perceptual inputs reaches a decision boundary. Unfortunately, there is not a
standard way for building such models, limiting their use. Current
implementations are hand-crafted, lack adaptability, and rely on inefficient
optimization techniques that do not scale well with large datasets. This paper
introduces Akkumula, an evidence accumulation modelling framework built using
deep learning techniques to leverage established coding libraries, gradient
optimization, and large batch training. The core of the library is based on
Spiking Neural Networks, whose operation mimic the evidence accumulation
process in the biological brain. The model was tested on data collected during
a test-track experiment. Results are promising. The model fits well the time
course of vehicle control (brake, accelerate, steering) based on vehicle sensor
data. The perceptual inputs are extracted by a dedicated neural network,
increasing the context-awareness of the model in dynamic scenarios. Akkumula
integrates with existing machine learning architectures, benefits from
continuous advancements in deep learning, efficiently processes large datasets,
adapts to diverse driving scenarios, and maintains a degree of transparency in
its core mechanisms.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法成功扩展了NeuMeta的应用范围，为神经网络的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural
networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct
generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen
during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves
effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its
broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that
extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with
minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe
comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies
for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain
competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a
scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The

Abstract: This study aims to analyze the economic performance of various parks under
different conditions, particularly focusing on the operational costs and power
load balancing before and after the deployment of energy storage systems.
Firstly, the economic performance of the parks without energy storage was
analyzed using a random forest model. Taking Park A as an example, it was found
that the cost had the greatest correlation with electricity purchase, followed
by photovoltaic output, indicating that solar and wind power output are key
factors affecting economic performance. Subsequently, the operation of the
parks after the configuration of a 50kW/100kWh energy storage system was
simulated, and the total cost and operation strategy of the energy storage
system were calculated. The results showed that after the deployment of energy
storage, the amount of wind and solar power curtailment in each park decreased,
and the operational costs were reduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used
to optimize the energy storage configuration of each park. The energy storage
operation strategy was optimized through fitness functions, crossover
operations, and mutation operations. After optimization, the economic
indicators of Parks A, B, and C all improved. The research results indicate
that by optimizing energy storage configuration, each park can reduce costs,
enhance economic benefits, and achieve sustainable development of the power
system.

Motivation: 盲语音分离是一个具有挑战性的盲逆问题，因为麦克风阵列几何结构、房间脉冲响应和语音源均未知。

Method: 基于扩散后验采样（DPS），通过优化问题近似声学参数和相对传递函数，结合扩散先验进行采样分离。

Result: ArrayDPS在SDR指标上优于所有无监督基线方法，与监督方法相当。

Conclusion: ArrayDPS提供了一种无需麦克风阵列信息的有效盲语音分离解决方案。

Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from
audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging
because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the
room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We
propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic,
and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling
(DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must
approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The
solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative
transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the
diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately
yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech
diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones;
no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that
ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable
to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at:

Abstract: Histopathology evaluation of tissue specimens through microscopic examination
is essential for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, traditional
manual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability,
potentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology
images continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis
to address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial
intelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have
significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing
histopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML
models are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and
reflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively,
particularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful
orientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological
biomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised
segmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA)
images from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The
biomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and
generalizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution
kernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and
robustness of ML models in digital pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to
improve diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of histopathology beyond
prostate cancer through equivariant imaging.

Abstract: While classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized
image classification, the emergence of quantum computing presents new
opportunities for enhancing neural network architectures. Quantum CNNs (QCNNs)
leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform
classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware
limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an
encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We
demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to
directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for
classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an
automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity
characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum
circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and
convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs
and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum
processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the
$71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training
conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image
classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum
computing in this area.

Abstract: The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) requires companies to
prove their products do not contribute to deforestation, creating a critical
demand for precise, asset-level environmental impact data. Current databases

Method: 作者首先证明了一个更紧的遗憾下界，并提出了一个新的信息论量来刻画隐私保护的难度。随后，他们选择了两种渐近最优的老虎机算法（DP-KLUCB和DP-IMED），并通过统一的框架（分阶段运行和添加拉普拉斯噪声）设计了它们的差分隐私版本。

Result: 对于伯努利老虎机，这些算法的遗憾渐近地匹配了新的下界，且可以无限接近于1。此外，作者还提出了一个新的拉普拉斯机制下的伯努利变量和的集中不等式。

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了差分隐私下随机多臂老虎机的遗憾界限，还否定了过去认为必须遗忘历史奖励才能设计最优算法的猜想。新的集中不等式为差分隐私文献提供了更紧的理论工具。

Abstract: As sequential learning algorithms are increasingly applied to real life,
ensuring data privacy while maintaining their utilities emerges as a timely
question. In this context, regret minimisation in stochastic bandits under
$\epsilon$-global Differential Privacy (DP) has been widely studied. Unlike
bandits without DP, there is a significant gap between the best-known regret
lower and upper bound in this setting, though they "match" in order. Thus, we
revisit the regret lower and upper bounds of $\epsilon$-global DP algorithms
for Bernoulli bandits and improve both. First, we prove a tighter regret lower
bound involving a novel information-theoretic quantity characterising the
hardness of $\epsilon$-global DP in stochastic bandits. Our lower bound
strictly improves on the existing ones across all $\epsilon$ values. Then, we
choose two asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms, i.e. DP-KLUCB and DP-IMED,
and propose their DP versions using a unified blueprint, i.e., (a) running in
arm-dependent phases, and (b) adding Laplace noise to achieve privacy. For
Bernoulli bandits, we analyse the regrets of these algorithms and show that
their regrets asymptotically match our lower bound up to a constant arbitrary
close to 1. This refutes the conjecture that forgetting past rewards is
necessary to design optimal bandit algorithms under global DP. At the core of
our algorithms lies a new concentration inequality for sums of Bernoulli
variables under Laplace mechanism, which is a new DP version of the Chernoff
bound. This result is universally useful as the DP literature commonly treats
the concentrations of Laplace noise and random variables separately, while we
couple them to yield a tighter bound.

### [1] [ScaleMCP: Dynamic and Auto-Synchronizing Model Context Protocol Tools for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06416)
*Elias Lumer,Anmol Gulati,Vamse Kumar Subbiah,Pradeep Honaganahalli Basavaraju,James A. Burke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScaleMCP是一种新型工具选择方法，通过动态集成MCP工具检索器和自动同步工具存储系统，显著提升了LLM代理的工具检索和调用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具选择框架未集成MCP服务器，依赖手动更新本地工具库，导致效率低下且缺乏动态查询能力。

Method: 提出ScaleMCP方法，包括动态工具检索器、自动同步工具存储系统及新型嵌入策略TDWA。

Result: 在5,000个金融指标MCP服务器数据集上的实验表明，ScaleMCP显著提升了工具检索和代理调用性能。

Conclusion: ScaleMCP在可扩展和动态工具选择与调用方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the introduction of
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have significantly expanded LLM agents'
capability to interact dynamically with external tools and APIs. However,
existing tool selection frameworks do not integrate MCP servers, instead
relying heavily on error-prone manual updates to monolithic local tool
repositories, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies.
Additionally, current approaches abstract tool selection before the LLM agent
is invoked, limiting its autonomy and hindering dynamic re-querying
capabilities during multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we
introduce ScaleMCP, a novel tool selection approach that dynamically equips LLM
agents with a MCP tool retriever, giving agents the autonomy to add tools into
their memory, as well as an auto-synchronizing tool storage system pipeline
through CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with MCP servers as the
single source of truth. We also propose a novel embedding strategy, Tool
Document Weighted Average (TDWA), designed to selectively emphasize critical
components of tool documents (e.g. tool name or synthetic questions) during the
embedding process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a created dataset of
5,000 financial metric MCP servers, across 10 LLM models, 5 embedding models,
and 5 retriever types, demonstrate substantial improvements in tool retrieval
and agent invocation performance, emphasizing ScaleMCP's effectiveness in
scalable, dynamic tool selection and invocation.

### [2] [Is your multimodal large language model a good science tutor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06418)
*Ming Liu,Liwen Wang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为科学导师的框架，通过教育评分标准和模拟学生模型优化模型的教学能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注答案准确性，忽略了教育场景中教学能力的重要性，需综合评估MLLMs的教学表现。

Method: 使用教育评分标准和模拟学生模型评估MLLMs，并通过偏好优化方法微调表现不佳的模型。

Result: 实验表明，问题解决能力强的模型未必教学效果好，优化后的模型更符合教育需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建兼具问题解决和教学能力的MLLMs提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive performance
on scientific reasoning tasks (e.g., ScienceQA). However, most existing
benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring
other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the
goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we
propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a
comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the
teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science
tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor
performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training
section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise
comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to
apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming
tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that
strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that
performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally
aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve
not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.

### [4] [Think in Safety: Unveiling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Collapse in Multimodal Large Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06538)
*Xinyue Lou,You Li,Jinan Xu,Xiangyu Shi,Chi Chen,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大型推理模型（MLRMs）的安全性问题，通过系统评估11种模型在5个基准测试中的表现，发现普遍的安全退化现象，并提出利用模型内在推理能力提升安全性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型推理模型的快速发展带来了广泛的应用潜力，但其安全性和可靠性仍需系统研究。

Method: 对11种MLRMs在5个基准测试中进行全面安全评估，构建包含安全导向思维过程的多模态调优数据集，并通过微调模型验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的模型在越狱鲁棒性和安全感知基准测试中均表现出更高的安全性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发安全的MLRMs提供了新视角，数据集已公开。

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) has
demonstrated broad application potential, yet their safety and reliability
remain critical concerns that require systematic exploration. To address this
gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs
across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most
advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across
different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across
jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks
demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, a long thought process
in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a
potential approach to addressing safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the
intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To
operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that
incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from
fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on
both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides
a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available at
https://github.com/xinyuelou/Think-in-Safety.

### [5] [REFINE-AF: A Task-Agnostic Framework to Align Language Models via Self-Generated Instructions using Reinforcement Learning from Automated Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06548)
*Aniruddha Roy,Pretam Ray,Abhilash Nandy,Somak Aditya,Pawan Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用开源小型LLM（如LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B）通过半自动化框架生成指令数据，减少人工干预和成本，并结合强化学习进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注指令数据耗时、昂贵且多样性有限，而依赖大型API模型（如GPT-3.5）成本高且查询受限。

Method: 采用半自动化框架结合小型开源LLM生成指令数据，并引入强化学习算法优化性能。

Result: RL-based框架在63-66%的任务中显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 小型开源LLM结合强化学习可高效生成高质量指令数据，降低成本和人工干预。

Abstract: Instruction-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in
numerous few-shot or zero-shot Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, creating human-annotated instruction data is time-consuming,
expensive, and often limited in quantity and task diversity. Previous research
endeavors have attempted to address this challenge by proposing frameworks
capable of generating instructions in a semi-automated and task-agnostic manner
directly from the model itself. Many of these efforts have relied on large
API-only parameter-based models such as GPT-3.5 (175B), which are expensive,
and subject to limits on a number of queries. This paper explores the
performance of three open-source small LLMs such as LLaMA 2-7B, LLama 2-13B,
and Mistral 7B, using a semi-automated framework, thereby reducing human
intervention, effort, and cost required to generate an instruction dataset for
fine-tuning LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) based training algorithm into this LLMs-based
framework leads to further enhancements. Our evaluation of the dataset reveals
that these RL-based frameworks achieve a substantial improvements in 63-66% of
the tasks compared to previous approaches.

### [6] [References Indeed Matter? Reference-Free Preference Optimization for Conversational Query Reformulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06552)
*Doyoung Kim,Youngjun Lee,Joeun Kim,Jihwan Bang,Hwanjun Song,Susik Yoon,Jae-Gil Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualReform是一种无需参考段落的对话查询重构框架，通过生成伪参考段落和双重角色优化，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖参考段落优化，但在实际场景中难以获取，因此需要一种无需参考段落的解决方案。

Method: DualReform通过响应推断生成伪参考段落，并利用CQR的双重角色优化响应，实现无需参考段落的优化。

Result: DualReform在不依赖参考段落的情况下，达到96.9--99.1%的检索准确率，并超越现有方法31.6%。

Conclusion: DualReform提供了一种高效且实用的对话查询重构方法，解决了参考段落依赖问题。

Abstract: Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for
improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing
approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are
impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform
that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered
conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform
attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference,
where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2)
response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines
responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR.
Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of
the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses
the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

### [7] [MacRAG: Compress, Slice, and Scale-up for Multi-Scale Adaptive Context RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06569)
*Woosang Lim,Zekun Li,Gyuwan Kim,Sungyoung Ji,HyeonJung Kim,Kyuri Choi,Jin Hyuk Lim,Kyungpyo Park,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MacRAG是一种分层检索框架，通过多尺度自适应上下文构建，优化长上下文和多跳推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RAG系统在检索不精确、上下文覆盖不完整和信息碎片化方面的问题。

Method: 采用分层检索框架，将文档压缩并分区为粗到细的粒度，实时自适应合并相关上下文。

Result: 在LongBench扩展任务中，MacRAG显著优于基线RAG系统。

Conclusion: MacRAG为长上下文和多跳推理任务提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context (LC) Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex
multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer
from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained context
windows, and fragmented information caused by suboptimal context construction.
We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical
retrieval framework that compresses and partitions documents into
coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through
chunk- and document-level expansions in real time. By starting from the
finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating higher-level and broader
context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing
both precision and coverage. Evaluations on the challenging LongBench
expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm that MacRAG
consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines on single- and multi-step
generation with Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish
MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context,
multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种可扩展的AI辅助评估工具，以替代人工编写的测试。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini生成问答测试，并通过学生和专家的评分及IRT分析评估其质量。

Result: 生成的测试项目具有强区分度和适当难度，用户满意度高，但发现两个项目需审查。

Conclusion: LLM生成的测试在心理测量学性能和用户满意度上可与人工测试媲美，展示了AI辅助评估的可扩展性。

Abstract: This research prepares an automatic pipeline for generating reliable
question-answer (Q&A) tests using AI chatbots. We automatically generated a
GPT-4o-mini-based Q&A test for a Natural Language Processing course and
evaluated its psychometric and perceived-quality metrics with students and
experts. A mixed-format IRT analysis showed that the generated items exhibit
strong discrimination and appropriate difficulty, while student and expert star
ratings reflect high overall quality. A uniform DIF check identified two items
for review. These findings demonstrate that LLM-generated assessments can match
human-authored tests in psychometric performance and user satisfaction,
illustrating a scalable approach to AI-assisted assessment development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视频到文本摘要方法，通过生成剧本表示整合视频、对话和角色信息，并引入多模态评估指标MFactSum。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在处理复杂多模态输入（如电视剧集）时难以平衡视觉和文本信息的问题。

Method: 零样本方法，仅使用音频、视频和文本输入生成剧本并命名角色，同时提出多模态评估指标MFactSum。

Result: 在SummScreen3D数据集上表现优于现有模型，生成的摘要包含更多视觉信息且输入需求减少75%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态摘要任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新的评估标准和方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to balance visual and textual
information when summarizing complex multimodal inputs, such as entire TV show
episodes. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot video-to-text summarization
approach that builds its own screenplay representation of an episode,
effectively integrating key video moments, dialogue, and character information
into a unified document. Unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously generate
screenplays and name the characters in zero-shot, using only the audio, video,
and transcripts as input. Additionally, we highlight that existing
summarization metrics can fail to assess the multimodal content in summaries.
To address this, we introduce MFactSum, a multimodal metric that evaluates
summaries with respect to both vision and text modalities. Using MFactSum, we
evaluate our screenplay summaries on the SummScreen3D dataset, demonstrating
superiority against state-of-the-art VLMs such as Gemini 1.5 by generating
summaries containing 20% more relevant visual information while requiring 75%
less of the video as input.

*Abbas Bertina,Shahab Beirami,Hossein Biniazian,Elham Esmaeilnia,Soheil Shahi,Mahdi Pirnia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对波斯语G2P转换的中间语言方法，结合LLM提示技术和序列到序列机器音译架构，显著提升了音素错误率（PER），为波斯语文本到语音系统提供了高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语的G2P转换因同形异义词和Ezafe等复杂音系特征而具有挑战性，尤其在正式和非正式语境中。

Method: 结合LLM提示技术和序列到序列机器音译架构，构建同形异义词的词汇数据库，利用形式概念分析进行语义区分，并使用LLM生成的数据集和B-Plus播客数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在波斯语音素转换的复杂性处理上优于现有技术，显著降低了PER，为波斯语G2P转换设立了新基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言处理提供了新思路，并展示了其在波斯语以外的语言（如中文和阿拉伯语）中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion for Persian presents unique challenges
due to its complex phonological features, particularly homographs and Ezafe,
which exist in formal and informal language contexts. This paper introduces an
intermediate language specifically designed for Persian language processing
that addresses these challenges through a multi-faceted approach. Our
methodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting
techniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration
architecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for
constructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple
pronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept
analysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct
datasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the
B-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results
demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme
conversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics,
establishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy. This work
contributes to the growing research in low-resource language processing and
provides a robust solution for Persian text-to-speech systems and demonstrating
its applicability beyond Persian. Specifically, the approach can extend to
languages with rich homographic phenomena such as Chinese and Arabic

### [11] [Using External knowledge to Enhanced PLM for Semantic Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06605)
*Min Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用外部知识增强预训练语义相关性判别模型的方法，并在10个公开数据集上验证了其性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模标注数据和复杂模型（如神经网络）在语义相关性任务中表现优异，但仅依赖标注数据可能无法涵盖所有必要知识。因此，论文探讨如何将外部知识融入模型以提升性能。

Method: 通过引入外部知识增强预训练的语义相关性判别模型，构建更全面的相关性检测模型。

Result: 在10个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线模型实现了性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合外部知识可以有效提升语义相关性判别模型的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling semantic relevance has always been a challenging and critical task
in natural language processing. In recent years, with the emergence of massive
amounts of annotated data, it has become feasible to train complex models, such
as neural network-based reasoning models. These models have shown excellent
performance in practical applications and have achieved the current
state-ofthe-art performance. However, even with such large-scale annotated
data, we still need to think: Can machines learn all the knowledge necessary to
perform semantic relevance detection tasks based on this data alone? If not,
how can neural network-based models incorporate external knowledge into
themselves, and how can relevance detection models be constructed to make full
use of external knowledge? In this paper, we use external knowledge to enhance
the pre-trained semantic relevance discrimination model. Experimental results
on 10 public datasets show that our method achieves consistent improvements in
performance compared to the baseline model.

### [12] [Boosting Neural Language Inference via Cascaded Interactive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06607)
*Min Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CIRN的新架构，通过多层级特征提取和交互式推理，提升自然语言推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预训练语言模型的最后一层表示，可能忽略了中间层的有价值信息，限制了复杂语义关系的建模能力。

Method: CIRN采用分层特征提取策略，在交互空间中逐步整合跨句子信息，实现从表层特征匹配到深层逻辑语义连接的推理过程。

Result: 在多个标准NLI数据集上的实验表明，CIRN性能优于基线方法，验证了多层级交互特征的有效性。

Conclusion: CIRN通过系统挖掘多层级语义关系，显著提升了自然语言推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on ascertaining the logical
relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) between a given premise
and hypothesis. This task presents significant challenges due to inherent
linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and
contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the
Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI,
prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal
layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information
encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model
intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce
the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture
designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a
hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths,
operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is
continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive
reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more
profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis.
By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various
representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the
input pair. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on several standard NLI
benchmark datasets reveal consistent performance gains achieved by CIRN over
competitive baseline approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging
multi-level interactive features for complex relational reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Hatefi等人的半监督文本分类模型，通过无监督预训练和深入性能评估，验证了改进模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在半监督学习任务中，如何利用少量黄金标注数据和大量未标注数据提升分类性能。

Method: 采用Meta Pseudo Labels的师生架构，教师生成未标注数据的伪标签训练学生模型，并通过无监督预训练（基于目标掩码）扩展原模型。

Result: 在英语和瑞典语的三个数据集上进行了实验，验证了改进模型的性能。

Conclusion: 扩展模型通过无监督预训练提升了半监督文本分类的性能。

Abstract: We extend and study a semi-supervised model for text classification proposed
earlier by Hatefi et al. for classification tasks in which document classes are
described by a small number of gold-labeled examples, while the majority of
training examples is unlabeled. The model leverages the teacher-student
architecture of Meta Pseudo Labels in which a ''teacher'' generates labels for
originally unlabeled training data to train the ''student'' and updates its own
model iteratively based on the performance of the student on the gold-labeled
portion of the data. We extend the original model of Hatefi et al. by an
unsupervised pre-training phase based on objective masking, and conduct
in-depth performance evaluations of the original model, our extension, and
various independent baselines. Experiments are performed using three different
datasets in two different languages (English and Swedish).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态信息调制算法，用于多领域情感分类，解决了现有超参数优化算法在领域增加时面临的资源、收敛和复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多领域情感分类中，领域分类任务对情感分类的影响因领域而异，但现有方法在领域增加时面临计算资源需求大、收敛问题和算法复杂度高的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段确定共享超参数控制领域分类任务比例；第二阶段引入基于梯度和损失的领域感知调制算法调整输入文本的领域信息。

Result: 在包含16个领域的公共情感分析数据集上，实验证明了所提方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 动态信息调制算法有效解决了多领域情感分类中的挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-domain sentiment classification aims to mitigate poor performance
models due to the scarcity of labeled data in a single domain, by utilizing
data labeled from various domains. A series of models that jointly train domain
classifiers and sentiment classifiers have demonstrated their advantages,
because domain classification helps generate necessary information for
sentiment classification. Intuitively, the importance of sentiment
classification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment
classification; but domain classification tasks are different because the
impact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across
different fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper
parameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1)
tremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3)
high algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information
required for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic
information modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is
divided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which
would control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields,
is determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware
modulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input
text, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method.
In summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset
containing 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 探讨FFN在模型预训练过程中的重要性，并优化其配置。

Method: 通过一系列实验比较不同层数的FFN配置对模型性能的影响。

Result: 三层FFN配置在训练损失、参数数量和训练时间上均优于标准的两层FFN配置。

Conclusion: FFN对模型性能至关重要，三层FFN配置是一种更优的选择。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformer networks have become incredibly popular for language
modeling tasks. State-of-the-art models can have over a hundred transformer
blocks, containing billions of trainable parameters, and are trained on
trillions of tokens of text. Each transformer block typically consists of a
multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism and a two-layer fully connected
feedforward network (FFN). In this paper, we examine the importance of the FFN
during the model pre-training process through a series of experiments,
confirming that the FFN is important to model performance. Furthermore, we show
that models using a transformer block configuration with three-layer FFNs with
fewer such blocks outperform the standard two-layer configuration delivering
lower training loss with fewer total parameters in less time.

TL;DR: TS-SUPERB是一个针对目标说话人语音处理任务的基准测试，填补了多说话人嘈杂环境下SSL模型评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单说话人场景，缺乏对多说话人嘈杂环境下目标说话人任务的评估，而后者更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: 引入TS-SUPERB基准，包含四项目标说话人处理任务，利用注册语音的说话人嵌入作为线索，并采用统一的SSL目标语音编码器（说话人编码器和提取模块）进行联合优化。

Result: 基准测试表明，SSL模型在目标说话人场景中的表现无法简单从单说话人任务中推断，且联合优化能有效利用任务间的互信息。

Conclusion: TS-SUPERB强调了在多说话人嘈杂环境下评估SSL模型的重要性，并展示了联合优化的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have significantly advanced speech
processing tasks, and several benchmarks have been proposed to validate their
effectiveness. However, previous benchmarks have primarily focused on
single-speaker scenarios, with less exploration of target-speaker tasks in
noisy, multi-talker conditions -- a more challenging yet practical case. In
this paper, we introduce the Target-Speaker Speech Processing Universal
Performance Benchmark (TS-SUPERB), which includes four widely recognized
target-speaker processing tasks that require identifying the target speaker and
extracting information from the speech mixture. In our benchmark, the speaker
embedding extracted from enrollment speech is used as a clue to condition
downstream models. The benchmark result reveals the importance of evaluating
SSL models in target speaker scenarios, demonstrating that performance cannot
be easily inferred from related single-speaker tasks. Moreover, by using a
unified SSL-based target speech encoder, consisting of a speaker encoder and an
extractor module, we also investigate joint optimization across TS tasks to
leverage mutual information and demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: BERTopic是一种基于Transformer嵌入的主题建模算法，通过评估18种不同的嵌入表示，研究发现可以找到优于默认设置的配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BERTopic中不同嵌入表示对主题建模性能的影响，以优化算法效果。

Method: 评估18种嵌入表示，并在三个数据集上实验，使用主题一致性和多样性指标衡量性能。

Result: 实验表明，针对每个数据集，存在优于BERTopic默认设置的嵌入配置。

Conclusion: 嵌入配置的选择显著影响BERTopic性能，且停用词对不同配置有影响。

Abstract: BERTopic is a topic modeling algorithm that leverages transformer-based
embeddings to create dense clusters, enabling the estimation of topic
structures and the extraction of valuable insights from a corpus of documents.
This approach allows users to efficiently process large-scale text data and
gain meaningful insights into its structure. While BERTopic is a powerful tool,
embedding preparation can vary, including extracting representations from
intermediate model layers and applying transformations to these embeddings. In
this study, we evaluate 18 different embedding representations and present
findings based on experiments conducted on three diverse datasets. To assess
the algorithm's performance, we report topic coherence and topic diversity
metrics across all experiments. Our results demonstrate that, for each dataset,
it is possible to find an embedding configuration that performs better than the
default setting of BERTopic. Additionally, we investigate the influence of stop
words on different embedding configurations.

Conclusion: Feedbacker为LLM评估提供了更全面的反馈，支持针对性优化和模型行为理解。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation benchmarks such as MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, and Auto-Arena
are seeing growing adoption for the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs).
Existing research has primarily focused on approximating human-based model
rankings using limited data and LLM-as-a-Judge. However, the fundamental
premise of these studies, which attempts to replicate human rankings, is
flawed. Specifically, these benchmarks typically offer only overall scores,
limiting their utility to leaderboard rankings, rather than providing feedback
that can guide model optimization and support model profiling. Therefore, we
advocate for an evaluation paradigm shift from approximating human-based model
rankings to providing feedback with analytical value. To this end, we introduce
Feedbacker, an evaluation framework that provides comprehensive and
fine-grained results, thereby enabling thorough identification of a model's
specific strengths and weaknesses. Such feedback not only supports the targeted
optimization of the model but also enhances the understanding of its behavior.
Feedbacker comprises three key components: an extensible tree-based query
taxonomy builder, an automated query synthesis scheme, and a suite of
visualization and analysis tools. Furthermore, we propose a novel
LLM-as-a-Judge method: PC2 (Pre-Comparison-derived Criteria) pointwise
evaluation. This method derives evaluation criteria by pre-comparing the
differences between several auxiliary responses, achieving the accuracy of
pairwise evaluation while maintaining the time complexity of pointwise
evaluation. Finally, leveraging the evaluation results of 17 mainstream LLMs,
we demonstrate the usage of Feedbacker and highlight its effectiveness and
potential. Our homepage project is available at

Motivation: 现有文献很少研究门控的具体效果，本文旨在系统研究门控增强的软注意力变体。

Method: 对30种15B MoE模型和1.7B密集模型进行实验，比较不同门控位置和计算变体。

Result: 头特定sigmoid门控能提升性能、稳定训练、容忍更大学习率，并增强长上下文外推能力。

Conclusion: 门控机制通过引入非线性和查询依赖的稀疏门控分数，有效提升了软注意力的性能。

Abstract: Gating mechanisms have been widely utilized, from early models like LSTMs and
Highway Networks to recent state space models, linear attention, and also
softmax attention. Yet, existing literature rarely examines the specific
effects of gating. In this work, we conduct comprehensive experiments to
systematically investigate gating-augmented softmax attention variants.
Specifically, we perform a comprehensive comparison over 30 variants of 15B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and 1.7B dense models trained on a 3.5 trillion
token dataset. Our central finding is that a simple modification-applying a
head-specific sigmoid gate after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention
(SDPA)-consistently improves performance. This modification also enhances
training stability, tolerates larger learning rates, and improves scaling
properties. By comparing various gating positions and computational variants,
we attribute this effectiveness to two key factors: (1) introducing
non-linearity upon the low-rank mapping in the softmax attention, and (2)
applying query-dependent sparse gating scores to modulate the SDPA output.
Notably, we find this sparse gating mechanism mitigates 'attention sink' and
enhances long-context extrapolation performance, and we also release related
$\href{https://github.com/qiuzh20/gated_attention}{codes}$ and
$\href{https://huggingface.co/QwQZh/gated_attention}{models}$ to facilitate

TL;DR: 本文利用GPT-4开发了一个基于大语言模型的句子分类器，用于分析澳大利亚和英国电子烟政策文件中的内容差异。结果显示，澳大利亚文件更强调电子烟的危害，而英国文件则更强调其益处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究澳大利亚和英国在电子烟政策上的差异，尽管两者基于相同的证据基础，却采取了截然不同的监管方式。

Method: 使用GPT-4开发句子分类器，自动分析109份政策文件中关于电子烟对公共健康影响的陈述。

Result: 分类器F-score为0.9；澳大利亚文件更多强调电子烟的危害，英国文件则更多强调其益处。

Conclusion: LLM方法支持了政策文件对证据的不同解读，为研究证据与健康政策关系提供了新工具。

Abstract: Australia and the UK have developed contrasting approaches to the regulation
of electronic cigarettes, with - broadly speaking - Australia adopting a
relatively restrictive approach and the UK adopting a more permissive approach.
Notably, these divergent policies were developed from the same broad evidence
base. In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions
manage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language
Model-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic
cigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK
legislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4
to automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that
e-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based
classifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to
our entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative
documents show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower
proportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the
opposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based
approach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the
same evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the
harms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the
benefits. Further, our approach provides a starting point for using LLM-based
methods to investigate the complex relationship between evidence and health
policy formation.

TL;DR: BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型在长文档摘要任务中表现优异，但受限于4096个token的最大长度，对超长文档摘要性能下降。本研究通过微调模型并采用数据增强方法解决此问题。


<details>

Motivation: 解决BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型在超长文档摘要任务中因token限制导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 微调预训练模型，筛选长度超过20,000 token的文档，并通过拆分文档-摘要对进行数据增强以适应模型长度限制。

Result: 模型在超长文档摘要任务中表现提升，避免了截断文档的常见方法。

Conclusion: 通过微调和数据增强，BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型能够有效处理超长文档摘要任务。

Abstract: $\texttt{BIGBIRD-PEGASUS}$ model achieves $\textit{state-of-the-art}$ on
abstractive text summarization for long documents. However it's capacity still
limited to maximum of $4,096$ tokens, thus caused performance degradation on
summarization for very long documents. Common method to deal with the issue is
to truncate the documents. In this reasearch, we'll use different approach.
We'll use the pretrained $\texttt{BIGBIRD-PEGASUS}$ model by fine tuned the
model on other domain dataset. First, we filter out all documents which length
less than $20,000$ tokens to focus on very long documents. To prevent domain
shifting problem and overfitting on transfer learning due to small dataset, we
augment the dataset by splitting document-summary training pair into parts, to
fit the document into $4,096$ tokens. Source code available on

TL;DR: IM-BERT通过将BERT层建模为ODE的解，提出了一种动态系统视角下的方法，增强了预训练语言模型在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，无需额外参数或对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在微调时容易受到对抗攻击的影响，导致过拟合。IM-BERT旨在解决这一问题，提升模型在对抗环境中的稳定性。

Method: 将BERT层视为ODE的解，分析数值稳定性，并提出IM-connection策略，结合显式和隐式欧拉方法。

Result: 在AdvGLUE数据集上，IM-BERT性能提升8.3%，在低资源场景下准确率提高5.9%。

Conclusion: IM-BERT通过动态系统方法显著提升了模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，尤其在资源有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
diverse NLP tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning
the model with a large number of parameters on limited downstream datasets
often leads to vulnerability to adversarial attacks, causing overfitting of the
model on standard datasets.
  To address these issues, we propose IM-BERT from the perspective of a dynamic
system by conceptualizing a layer of BERT as a solution of Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs). Under the situation of initial value
perturbation, we analyze the numerical stability of two main numerical ODE
solvers: the explicit and implicit Euler approaches.
  Based on these analyses, we introduce a numerically robust IM-connection
incorporating BERT's layers. This strategy enhances the robustness of PLMs
against adversarial attacks, even in low-resource scenarios, without
introducing additional parameters or adversarial training strategies.
  Experimental results on the adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE) dataset validate the
robustness of IM-BERT under various conditions. Compared to the original BERT,
IM-BERT exhibits a performance improvement of approximately 8.3\%p on the
AdvGLUE dataset. Furthermore, in low-resource scenarios, IM-BERT outperforms
BERT by achieving 5.9\%p higher accuracy.

Motivation: 解决大规模社交模拟中高时间和计算成本的问题，同时避免现有方法在准确性和通用性上的妥协。

Method: 分两阶段：语言进化（筛选同义词并优化句子规则）和语言利用（代理使用进化后的语言进行通信）。

Result: 实验显示EcoLANG减少20%以上的token消耗，提升效率且不影响模拟准确性。

Conclusion: EcoLANG为社交模拟提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to
role-play humans and replicate complex social dynamics. While large-scale
social simulations are gaining increasing attention, they still face
significant challenges, particularly regarding high time and computation costs.
Existing solutions, such as distributed mechanisms or hybrid agent-based model
(ABM) integrations, either fail to address inference costs or compromise
accuracy and generalizability. To this end, we propose EcoLANG: Efficient and
Effective Agent Communication Language Induction for Social Simulation. EcoLANG
operates in two stages: (1) language evolution, where we filter synonymous
words and optimize sentence-level rules through natural selection, and (2)
language utilization, where agents in social simulations communicate using the
evolved language. Experimental results demonstrate that EcoLANG reduces token
consumption by over 20%, enhancing efficiency without sacrificing simulation
accuracy.

Motivation: 解决RAG中无关段落对LLM生成答案的干扰问题，提升系统准确性。

Method: 量化段落的干扰效应，提出识别硬干扰段落的方法，并利用这些段落微调LLM。

Result: 通过硬干扰段落微调LLM，实现了7.5%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 论文为识别和利用硬干扰段落提供了全面框架，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that
retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the
answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this
paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of
a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the
distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs.
  Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard
distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these
carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in
answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG
datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary
classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs.
distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding
hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided
such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting
passages.

Result: 分析表明，前半部分由‘老师’书写，后半部分由‘学生’书写，揭示了书写训练的可能性。

Abstract: A cuneiform tablet KBo 23.1 ++/KUB 30.38, which is known to represent a text
of Kizzuwatna rituals, was written by two writers with almost identical content
in two iterations. Unlike other cuneiform tablets that contained information
such as myths, essays, or business records, the reason why ancient people left
such tablets for posterity remains unclear. To study this problem, we develop a
new methodology by analyzing images of a tablet quantitatively using CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network)-based image models, without segmenting
cuneiforms one-by-one. Our data-driven methodology implies that the writer
writing the first half was a `teacher' and the other writer was a `student' who
was training his skills of writing cuneiforms. This result has not been reached
by classical linguistics. We also discuss related conclusions and possible
further directions for applying our method and its generalizations.

Result: 在ESC数据集上，straQ*表现优于直接推理、自优化、思维链、微调和有限状态机等基线方法。

Conclusion: straQ*通过Q学习和LLM的结合，显著提升了ESC的长期效果。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress
of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models
(LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might
not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a
suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we
leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our
framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC,
determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide
the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that
straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine,
chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

Motivation: 传统主题模型在处理上下文和罕见词时表现不佳，导致主题质量低。LLM生成的主题虽能缓解问题，但缺乏精细化和代表性。

Method: 结合BERT、SBERT和GNN优化LLM生成的主题嵌入，通过图神经网络连接文档、主题和词汇，提出新的相似度计算方法。

Result: 在英语和法语的医疗数据集上实验，证明HAMLET能有效提升主题质量。

Conclusion: HAMLET通过神经增强语义融合显著改进了主题建模的连贯性和可解释性。

Abstract: Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to
adequately handle polysemy and rare words. This limitation typically results in
topics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can
mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw
topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to
redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper
introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare
topic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced
semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM.
Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation
to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic
embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a
hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for
embedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which
establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and
similar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities.
Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are
extracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in
English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.

Motivation: 数学教育中有效反馈对改进教学实践至关重要，但现有话语分析方法存在多功能性和遗漏问题，限制了反馈的全面性。

Method: 提出多视角话语分析框架，整合谈话动作、对话行为（43个标签）和话语关系（16种关系），应用于数学教育数据集。

Result: 发现无谈话动作话语在引导、确认和结构化课堂话语中起关键作用，揭示了有意义的话语模式。

Conclusion: 将话语关系和对话行为纳入AI辅助教育系统可提升反馈质量，框架对开发模拟教育者和学生的AI代理也有帮助。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

Motivation: 医疗文本数据量大且复杂，传统分类方法难以高效处理，需要一种既能满足准确性又能适应资源受限环境的方法。

Method: 结合知识蒸馏和顺序微调，利用粒子群优化（PSO）进行超参数调优，将BERT的知识迁移到轻量级模型DistilBERT。

Result: 在三个不同规模的医疗数据集上，KDH-MLTC表现优于现有方法，最大数据集的F1分数达82.70%。

Conclusion: KDH-MLTC在资源受限的医疗环境中平衡了效率和准确性，为医疗文本分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing volume of healthcare textual data requires computationally
efficient, yet highly accurate classification approaches able to handle the
nuanced and complex nature of medical terminology. This research presents
Knowledge Distillation for Healthcare Multi-Label Text Classification
(KDH-MLTC), a framework leveraging model compression and Large Language Models
(LLMs). The proposed approach addresses conventional healthcare Multi-Label
Text Classification (MLTC) challenges by integrating knowledge distillation and
sequential fine-tuning, subsequently optimized through Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning. KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from
a more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e.,
DistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the
teacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational
requirements. As a result, the classification is enabled to be conducted
locally, making it suitable for healthcare textual data characterized by
sensitivity and, therefore, ensuring HIPAA compliance. The experiments
conducted on three medical literature datasets of different sizes, sampled from
the Hallmark of Cancer (HoC) dataset, demonstrate that KDH-MLTC achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches, particularly for the
largest dataset, reaching an F1 score of 82.70%. Additionally, statistical
validation and an ablation study are carried out, proving the robustness of
KDH-MLTC. Furthermore, the PSO-based hyperparameter optimization process
allowed the identification of optimal configurations. The proposed approach
contributes to healthcare text classification research, balancing efficiency
requirements in resource-constrained healthcare settings with satisfactory
accuracy demands.

Conclusion: SENATOR框架通过针对性数据生成和知识修复，显著提升了LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance by
leveraging vast pretraining corpora, yet their performance remains suboptimal
in knowledge-intensive domains such as medicine and scientific research, where
high factual precision is required. While synthetic data provides a promising
avenue for augmenting domain knowledge, existing methods frequently generate
redundant samples that do not align with the model's true knowledge gaps. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structural Entropy-guided
Knowledge Navigator (SENATOR) framework that addresses the intrinsic knowledge
deficiencies of LLMs. Our approach employs the Structure Entropy (SE) metric to
quantify uncertainty along knowledge graph paths and leverages Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to selectively explore regions where the model lacks
domain-specific knowledge. Guided by these insights, the framework generates
targeted synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, enabling continuous
self-improvement. Experimental results on LLaMA-3 and Qwen2 across multiple
domain-specific benchmarks show that SENATOR effectively detects and repairs
knowledge deficiencies, achieving notable performance improvements. The code
and data for our methods and experiments are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于上下文的单句训练在对话TTS中表现优于完整对话训练，MOS得分更高（4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0），且训练时间减少37%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有开源架构或训练技术是否导致高质量对话TTS系统难以公开获取的问题。

Method: 通过20 GPU小时的实验，对比上下文单句训练与完整对话训练两种方法。

Result: 上下文单句训练在MOS得分和训练效率上表现更优，完整对话训练存在说话人相似性幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 对话TTS开发应优先采用基于上下文的单句训练，兼顾资源效率和输出质量。

Abstract: Modern TTS systems designed for conversations achieve high-quality utterances
but often remain inaccessible publicly. Are existing open-source architectures
inadequate, or are current training techniques insufficient? This paper
investigates prominent models and their underlying behaviors regarding
conversational context. Using 20 GPU-hours on an NVIDIA H100, we empirically
examine two approaches: context-based utterance-level training versus full
conversation training. Results demonstrate that context-based utterance
training achieves superior MOS scores (4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0) and reduces training
time by 37%, while full conversation approaches suffer from speaker similarity
hallucination issues. These findings provide practical guidelines for
conversational TTS development, favoring utterance-level training with
contextual conditioning for both resource efficiency and output quality.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个包含12,000项问答的基准数据集，用于评估医疗领域大型语言模型（LLMs）的伦理和安全风险，并揭示了当前模型的性能不足及治理缺陷，最后提出了一个治理框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国‘健康中国2030’计划下，LLMs在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但同时也带来了伦理和患者安全的新挑战，需要量化评估和治理。

Method: 研究构建了一个覆盖11个伦理维度和9个安全维度的问答基准数据集，用于评估主流中文医疗LLMs的性能，并通过微调验证改进效果。

Result: 评估显示当前LLMs在伦理和安全场景中的表现中等（如Qwen 2.5-32B准确率42.7%），微调后有所提升（最高50.8%），但治理体系存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了医疗领域LLMs治理的紧迫性，并提出了一个包含审计团队、数据伦理准则和安全模拟的治理框架，以平衡AI创新与患者安全。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to transform healthcare under China's
Healthy China 2030 initiative, yet they introduce new ethical and
patient-safety challenges. We present a novel 12,000-item Q&A benchmark
covering 11 ethics and 9 safety dimensions in medical contexts, to
quantitatively evaluate these risks. Using this dataset, we assess
state-of-the-art Chinese medical LLMs (e.g., Qwen 2.5-32B, DeepSeek), revealing
moderate baseline performance (accuracy 42.7% for Qwen 2.5-32B) and significant
improvements after fine-tuning on our data (up to 50.8% accuracy). Results show
notable gaps in LLM decision-making on ethics and safety scenarios, reflecting
insufficient institutional oversight. We then identify systemic governance
shortfalls-including the lack of fine-grained ethical audit protocols, slow
adaptation by hospital IRBs, and insufficient evaluation tools-that currently
hinder safe LLM deployment. Finally, we propose a practical governance
framework for healthcare institutions (embedding LLM auditing teams, enacting
data ethics guidelines, and implementing safety simulation pipelines) to
proactively manage LLM risks. Our study highlights the urgent need for robust
LLM governance in Chinese healthcare, aligning AI innovation with patient
safety and ethical standards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynamicRAG是一个基于强化学习的RAG框架，动态调整检索文档的数量和顺序，显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的重排序器常忽略LLM提供的监督信号，且固定文档数量可能导致信息缺失或噪声引入。

Method: 将重排序器建模为通过强化学习优化的智能体，利用LLM输出质量作为奖励信号。

Result: 在七个知识密集型数据集上，DynamicRAG实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DynamicRAG通过动态调整检索策略，显著提升了RAG系统的效果和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for
knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of
these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance
generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal
number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical
information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent
studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal
model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can
provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking
decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where
the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved
documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized
through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output
quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates
superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The model, data and
code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/DynamicRAG

TL;DR: SAS-Bench是一个专为LLM设计的短答案评分基准，提供细粒度评分和专家标注错误类别，旨在解决现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主观答案评分方法评分粗糙且缺乏详细推理，LLMs作为零样本评估者存在偏见和不透明问题。

Method: 引入SAS-Bench基准，包含细粒度评分、专家标注错误类别和多样化问题类型，并发布开源数据集。

Result: 实验表明，科学类问题评分存在挑战，少样本提示能有效提高评分准确性。

Conclusion: SAS-Bench为开发更稳健、公平且教育意义强的LLM评分系统提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education,
standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for
evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However,
existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed
reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as
zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with
human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed
for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring,
expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types
derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates
detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also
release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student
responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in
scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of
few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable
insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally
meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

TL;DR: VDBA是一种仅需受害者文本的对抗攻击方法，通过替代模型和多样化对抗样本生成，显著提高了攻击成功率并减少了查询需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要受害者模型知识、大量查询或训练数据，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用公开预训练模型和聚类方法构建替代模型，采用分层设计和多样化对抗样本生成。

Result: 在Emotion和SST5数据集上，VDBA攻击成功率提升52.08%，查询次数降为0，对LLMs（如Qwen2和GPT家族）构成威胁。

Conclusion: VDBA证实了高级NLP模型仍面临严重安全风险，无需API访问即可实现高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language
Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks
often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to
training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints,
we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which
operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we
create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and
clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address
the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we
propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute
models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision
boundary.
  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing
various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with
better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5
datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR
improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More
importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as
Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without
access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious
security risks. Our codes can be found at

TL;DR: 论文研究了Bradley-Terry（BT）模型在强化学习人类反馈（RLHF）中的奖励建模问题，提出了一种批处理零和正则化（BSR）方法以解决奖励模型的过优化问题，提高了模型的分布鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BT模型在RLHF中广泛使用，但其训练的奖励模型容易过优化，导致在未见数据上泛化性差。研究旨在分析过优化原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出批处理零和正则化（BSR），通过约束批次内奖励总和为零来限制极端奖励值，从而提高鲁棒性。

Result: BSR在四种过优化场景中表现更鲁棒，且在RLHF训练中优于普通BT模型，显著提升了复杂偏好预测任务的性能。

Conclusion: BSR显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性，进而改善了RLHF训练的效果，展示了在高质量数据和模型上的优越性。

Abstract: The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for
reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness,
reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization,
losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study
the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the
RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs
in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state
norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise
sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch,
constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR
in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization,
where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare
the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust
RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR
to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B
scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By
conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length
by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that
robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training. We release the code,
data, and models: https://github.com/LinkedIn-XFACT/RM-Robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署的快速增长需要高效的压缩技术以减少计算和内存成本，但剪枝与量化的联合潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究联合压缩方法，结合剪枝和量化，并引入新指标SrCr以评估压缩与语义保留的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，推荐的联合压缩方法在相同理论压缩率下比纯量化模型性能提升20%。

Conclusion: 联合剪枝和量化的方法在性能与压缩比上优于单一方法，SrCr指标为优化配置提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The exponential growth in Large Language Model (LLM) deployment has
intensified the need for efficient model compression techniques to reduce
computational and memory costs. While pruning and quantization have shown
promise, their combined potential remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
examine joint compression and how strategically combining pruning and
quantization could yield superior performance-to-compression ratios compared to
single-method approaches. Recognizing the challenges in accurately assessing
LLM performance, we address key limitations of previous evaluation frameworks
and introduce the Semantic Retention Compression Rate (SrCr), a novel metric
that quantifies the trade-off between model compression and semantic
preservation, facilitating the optimization of pruning-quantization
configurations. Experiments demonstrate that our recommended combination
achieves, on average, a 20% performance increase compared to an equivalent
quantization-only model at the same theoretical compression rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖监督分类器选择数据，容易引入领域偏差，而注意力头对上下文推理至关重要，因此提出无需监督的方法。

Method: 通过识别检索头并计算掩码后的损失差异，用小型预训练模型作为数据选择器，应用于1.3B参数模型选择数据。

Result: 在多个推理密集型基准测试中（如MMLU、GSM8K等），性能提升1.4pp至3.5pp。

Conclusion: AttentionInfluence展示了小模型提升大模型性能的潜力，为推理中心数据选择提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in collecting reasoning-intensive
pretraining data to improve LLMs' complex reasoning ability. Prior approaches
typically rely on supervised classifiers to identify such data, which requires
labeling by humans or LLMs, often introducing domain-specific biases. Due to
the attention heads being crucial to in-context reasoning, we propose
AttentionInfluence, a simple yet effective, training-free method without
supervision signal. Our approach enables a small pretrained language model to
act as a strong data selector through a simple attention head masking
operation. Specifically, we identify retrieval heads and compute the loss
difference when masking these heads. We apply AttentionInfluence to a
1.3B-parameter dense model to conduct data selection on the SmolLM corpus of
241B tokens, and mix the SmolLM corpus with the selected subset comprising 73B
tokens to pretrain a 7B-parameter dense model using 1T training tokens and WSD
learning rate scheduling. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements, ranging from 1.4pp to 3.5pp, across several knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (i.e., MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGIEval-en, GSM8K, and
HumanEval). This demonstrates an effective weak-to-strong scaling property,
with small models improving the final performance of larger models-offering a
promising and scalable path for reasoning-centric data selection.

Abstract: Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to
enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this
paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is
affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2)
Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration),
and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are
highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning
tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge
consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically
explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise
specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for
more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete
guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies
critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent
reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Result: QUPID在实验中表现优于主流LLMs（Cohen's Kappa为0.646 vs. 0.387），推理速度快60倍，并在生产搜索系统中将nDCG@5分数提高了1.9%。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同架构的SLMs，QUPID显著提升了信息检索系统的相关性和操作效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for relevance assessment
in information retrieval. However, our study demonstrates that combining two
distinct small language models (SLMs) with different architectures can
outperform LLMs in this task. Our approach -- QUPID -- integrates a generative
SLM with an embedding-based SLM, achieving higher relevance judgment accuracy
while reducing computational costs compared to state-of-the-art LLM solutions.
This computational efficiency makes QUPID highly scalable for real-world search
systems processing millions of queries daily. In experiments across diverse
document types, our method demonstrated consistent performance improvements
(Cohen's Kappa of 0.646 versus 0.387 for leading LLMs) while offering 60x
faster inference times. Furthermore, when integrated into production search
pipelines, QUPID improved nDCG@5 scores by 1.9%. These findings underscore how
architectural diversity in model combinations can significantly enhance both
search relevance and operational efficiency in information retrieval systems.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要针对英语和印尼语，缺乏对低资源语言（如越南语）的支持，因此需要构建越南语的多模态评论有用性预测数据集。

Method: 构建ViMRHP数据集，覆盖4个领域，包含2K产品和46K评论，利用AI辅助标注以减少时间和成本。

Result: AI辅助标注将标注时间从90-120秒降至20-40秒，成本降低约65%，但复杂任务中AI标注仍有局限性。

Conclusion: ViMRHP为越南语多模态评论有用性预测提供了基准数据集，AI辅助标注显著提升了效率，但需进一步优化复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in
recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the
helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves
consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on
English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially
for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce
ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale
benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four
domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale
dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation
process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP
dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per
task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and
lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations
still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine
through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we
evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to
assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有常识知识库（如ConceptNet）在捕捉各行业领域的显性知识方面存在不足，尤其是行业任务的定义较少。

Method: 通过训练神经网络模型学习任务与行业组的亲和力，并应用聚类选择每个行业组的top-k任务。

Result: 从两个公开新闻数据集中提取了2339个形式为⟨IG, is capable of, task⟩的三元组，覆盖24个行业组，精确度为0.86。

Conclusion: 验证了提取的任务-行业组对的可靠性，可直接用于扩充现有知识库。

Abstract: Commonsense knowledge bases (KB) are a source of specialized knowledge that
is widely used to improve machine learning applications. However, even for a
large KB such as ConceptNet, capturing explicit knowledge from each industry
domain is challenging. For example, only a few samples of general {\em tasks}
performed by various industries are available in ConceptNet. Here, a task is a
well-defined knowledge-based volitional action to achieve a particular goal. In
this paper, we aim to fill this gap and present a weakly-supervised framework
to augment commonsense KB with tasks carried out by various industry groups
(IG). We attempt to {\em match} each task with one or more suitable IGs by
training a neural model to learn task-IG affinity and apply clustering to
select the top-k tasks per IG. We extract a total of 2339 triples of the form
$\langle IG, is~capable~of, task \rangle$ from two publicly available news
datasets for 24 IGs with the precision of 0.86. This validates the reliability

Motivation: 研究动机在于扩展Grievance Dictionary的应用范围至非英语语言，以分析暴力、威胁或不满情绪的文本。

Method: 采用自动翻译结合人工标注的方法，并进行心理测量分析，包括内部可靠性和与LIWC词典的相关性。

Result: 荷兰语和德语翻译表现与英语原版相似，意大利语版本在某些类别上可靠性较低。

Conclusion: 建议进一步验证和应用词典，并推广类似方法用于未来词典翻译。

Abstract: This paper introduces and evaluates three translations of the Grievance
Dictionary, a psycholinguistic dictionary for the analysis of violent,
threatening or grievance-fuelled texts. Considering the relevance of these
themes in languages beyond English, we translated the Grievance Dictionary to
Dutch, German, and Italian. We describe the process of automated translation
supplemented by human annotation. Psychometric analyses are performed,
including internal reliability of dictionary categories and correlations with
the LIWC dictionary. The Dutch and German translations perform similarly to the
original English version, whereas the Italian dictionary shows low reliability
for some categories. Finally, we make suggestions for further validation and
application of the dictionary, as well as for future dictionary translations
following a similar approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖高级模型的数据合成，成本高且存在数据兼容性问题。

Method: 分解工具学习目标为子任务，引入自我进化范式。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同规模和架构模型中的有效性。

Conclusion: ToolACE-DEV提供了一种高效且低成本的工具学习解决方案。

Abstract: The tool-using capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to
access up-to-date external information and handle complex tasks. Current
approaches to enhancing this capability primarily rely on distilling advanced
models by data synthesis. However, this method incurs significant costs
associated with advanced model usage and often results in data compatibility
issues, led by the high discrepancy in the knowledge scope between the advanced
model and the target model. To address these challenges, we propose
ToolACE-DEV, a self-improving framework for tool learning. First, we decompose
the tool-learning objective into sub-tasks that enhance basic tool-making and
tool-using abilities. Then, we introduce a self-evolving paradigm that allows
lightweight models to self-improve, reducing reliance on advanced LLMs.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across models
of varying scales and architectures.

Conclusion: SEReDeEP通过语义熵增强，显著改进了RAG模型中的幻觉检测效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models frequently encounter
hallucination phenomena when integrating external information with internal
parametric knowledge. Empirical studies demonstrate that the disequilibrium
between external contextual information and internal parametric knowledge
constitutes a primary factor in hallucination generation. Existing
hallucination detection methodologies predominantly emphasize either the
external or internal mechanism in isolation, thereby overlooking their
synergistic effects. The recently proposed ReDeEP framework decouples these
dual mechanisms, identifying two critical contributors to hallucinations:
excessive reliance on parametric knowledge encoded in feed-forward networks
(FFN) and insufficient utilization of external information by attention
mechanisms (particularly copy heads). ReDeEP quantitatively assesses these
factors to detect hallucinations and dynamically modulates the contributions of
FFNs and copy heads to attenuate their occurrence. Nevertheless, ReDeEP and
numerous other hallucination detection approaches have been employed at
logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency
evaluation, inadequately address the semantic dimensions of model responses,
resulting in inconsistent hallucination assessments in RAG implementations.
Building upon ReDeEP's foundation, this paper introduces SEReDeEP, which
enhances computational processes through semantic entropy captured via trained
linear probes, thereby achieving hallucination assessments that more accurately
reflect ground truth evaluations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多维度约束框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在遵循用户定义约束方面的能力，并通过自动化指令生成管道生成了1,200个可验证的测试样本。评估了19个LLMs，发现性能随约束形式变化显著，并展示了该方法在强化学习中的应用潜力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖模板化约束提示，缺乏真实场景的多样性和细粒度性能评估，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出多维度约束框架（三种约束模式、四类约束、四个难度级别），开发自动化指令生成管道（约束扩展、冲突检测、指令重写），生成1,200个测试样本。

Result: 评估19个LLMs，性能从难度I的77.67%降至难度IV的32.96%；应用于强化学习时显著提升指令遵循能力，且不影响通用性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了现有评估工具的不足，并通过参数调整增强了模型的约束识别和遵循能力。

Abstract: Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability
to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing
benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity
of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this
gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three
constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels.
Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation
pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and
instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following
test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover
substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance,
average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate
data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction
following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates
that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention
modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code
and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.

Conclusion: IKEA通过知识边界感知机制，有效提升LLMs的推理效率和准确性，为检索增强生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning
(RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval
capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This
can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and
increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and
adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and
synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external)
knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced
Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could
indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal
knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed
insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward
function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed
for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to
deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage
appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations
across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly
outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and
exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 该研究为计算叙事学提供了可扩展的角色分析框架，有望应用于AI驱动的交互式叙事和自动化叙事生成。

Abstract: Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and
character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational
narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into
automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered
deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these
analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability
needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative
generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for
systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional
detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive
investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a
diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes,
William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin -
capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The
identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further
tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of
91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive
investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the
broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework
for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive
storytelling and automated narrative generation.

TL;DR: ConceptX是一种模型无关的概念级解释方法，通过语义相似度评估提示中的概念重要性，优于现有的token级方法，提升LLM的安全性和对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，其安全性和对齐性问题日益突出。现有token级解释方法难以捕捉输出的整体语义，需要一种更全面的解释方法。

Method: ConceptX通过识别提示中的语义丰富概念（concepts），并基于输出语义相似度分配重要性，支持上下文完整性保护和灵活的解释目标（如性别偏见）。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ConceptX在忠实度和人类对齐性上优于TokenSHAP等token级方法。通过提示修改，情感偏移提升0.252，攻击成功率从0.463降至0.242。

Conclusion: ConceptX为提升LLM安全性和对齐性提供了一种透明且忠实的方法，展示了基于归因的解释在指导LLM行为中的实用价值。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their
safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as
mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts
of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level
attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text
generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,
rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce
ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies
the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them
importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current
token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through
in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,
gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and
steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness
of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX
outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human
alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for
random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming
attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and
self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a
transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment,
demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in
guiding LLM behavior.

Motivation: 人类认知与时间感知（Chronoception）密切相关，但AI在时间有效性推理方面仍有不足。

Method: 通过拟合偏态正态曲线，Chronocept捕捉了知识的时间模式（如出现、衰减和峰值），并包含两个数据集。

Result: 基线模型预测曲线参数（位置、尺度和偏度），优于基于分类的方法，且注释者一致性高（84%和89%）。

Conclusion: Chronocept为AI的时间推理提供了基础支持，适用于知识落地、事实核查和检索增强生成等应用。

Abstract: Human cognition is deeply intertwined with a sense of time, known as
Chronoception. This sense allows us to judge how long facts remain valid and
when knowledge becomes outdated. Despite progress in vision, language, and
motor control, AI still struggles to reason about temporal validity. We
introduce Chronocept, the first benchmark to model temporal validity as a
continuous probability distribution over time. Using skew-normal curves fitted
along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced
patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets:
Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages).
Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines
predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling
interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based
approaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning,
supporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents. Code and data are
publicly available.

employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career

multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3
million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000
user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering
valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset
enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job
stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It
also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making
processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics,
including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating

Abstract: This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody
-- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized
using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make
lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word
identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis
in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal
languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud
in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual
information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across
languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these
curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal
languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual
information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our
results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather
than categorical.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, particularly in
scientific domains that demand specialized and dynamic information. Despite its
promise, the application of RAG in the chemistry domain remains underexplored,
primarily due to the lack of high-quality, domain-specific corpora and
well-curated evaluation benchmarks. In this work, we introduce ChemRAG-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of
RAG across a diverse set of chemistry-related tasks. The accompanying chemistry
corpus integrates heterogeneous knowledge sources, including scientific
literature, the PubChem database, PubMed abstracts, textbooks, and Wikipedia
entries. In addition, we present ChemRAG-Toolkit, a modular and extensible RAG
toolkit that supports five retrieval algorithms and eight LLMs. Using
ChemRAG-Toolkit, we demonstrate that RAG yields a substantial performance gain
-- achieving an average relative improvement of 17.4% over direct inference
methods. We further conduct in-depth analyses on retriever architectures,
corpus selection, and the number of retrieved passages, culminating in
practical recommendations to guide future research and deployment of RAG
systems in the chemistry domain. The code and data is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示方法依赖模型的隐式推理，难以保证逻辑的完整性和一致性，且不易调试和更新。Codified Profiles通过显式表示角色逻辑，解决了这些问题。

Method: Codified Profiles将角色逻辑定义为结构化函数，如parse_by_scene(scene)和check_condition(scene, question)，支持显式控制结构和条件检查。实验基于83个角色和5,141个场景的基准测试，使用NLI评分验证效果。

Result: 实验表明，Codified Profiles显著提升了逻辑持久性、可更新性和行为多样性，且使小规模模型（如1B参数）也能实现高质量角色扮演。

Conclusion: Codified Profiles为角色扮演提供了一种可扩展、高效的方法，尤其适合本地部署，解决了传统提示方法的局限性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach
that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for
behavioral decision-making. Each profile defines a set of functions
parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions
triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g.,
if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where
each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is
the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true,
false, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages
over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions
directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and
consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's
implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and
revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in
prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic
behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that
prompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we
introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes
curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses
against ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant
benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and
behavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning
to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform
high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for
local deployment of role-play agents.

Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks involve diverse skills that probe
the information extraction, classification and/or generation capabilities of
models. In this setting, task-specific training data may not always be
available. While traditional task-specific SLU models are unable to cater to
such requirements, the speech-text large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative with emergent abilities. However, out of-the-box, our
evaluations indicate that the zero/few-shot performance of prominent
open-source speech-text LLMs on SLU tasks are not up to the mark. In this
paper, we introduce a novel approach to robust task-agnostic fine-tuning using
randomized class labels. With this proposed fine-tuning, we illustrate that the
performance of the speech-text LLMs on an unseen task is significantly improved
over standard approaches. Critically, the proposed approach avoids the
requirement of task-specific data annotations for enabling new tasks in
speech-text LLMs.

Abstract: Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing
decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to
high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of
conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion,
introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged
for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and
unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also
susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and
bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive
content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited
due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured
around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores
AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee,
which examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as
a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive
strategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We
introduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key
challenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative
persuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey
outlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and
effectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by
increasingly capable language models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在生成文本时如何近似训练数据的分布，发现生成的文本在多数统计特性上与原始数据存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM性能的提升，研究其是否能忠实近似训练数据的分布特性，尤其是在语义控制环境下。

Method: 通过观察性方法，使用开源LLM重新生成Wikipedia和新闻文本，比较生成文本与原文本在句法、可读性、依赖标签分布等特性上的差异。

Result: 生成的文本在多数统计特性上均值偏移、标准差降低，且长尾减少。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本在统计特性上与原始数据存在系统性差异，表明其近似能力仍有局限。

Abstract: Recent improvement in large language model performance have, in all
likelihood, been accompanied by improvement in how well they can approximate
the distribution of their training data. In this work, we explore the following
question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and
how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus
linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from
two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in
LLM training data -- Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows
us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text
domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying
levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence
length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties
such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity. We find
that the majority of the regenerated distributions show a shifted mean, a lower
standard deviation, and a reduction of the long tail, as compared to the human
originals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaP（Learning from Peers）的方法，通过让推理路径在推理过程中共享中间结果，帮助大型推理模型（LRMs）避免因初始错误导致的‘前缀主导陷阱’，从而提升自我纠正能力。实验表明LeaP显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现大型推理模型在初始推理路径较差时难以自我纠正（前缀主导陷阱），受心理学中‘同伴互动促进自我纠正’的启发，提出了LeaP方法。

Method: LeaP通过在推理过程中定期共享和整合不同推理路径的中间结果，引入同伴见解。针对小模型的问题，进一步提出了LeaP-T系列模型。

Result: 实验表明LeaP显著提升了模型性能，例如QwQ-32B平均提升5分，并在多个数学基准上超越DeepSeek-R1-671B。LeaP-T-7B甚至达到与更大模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: LeaP通过同伴协作显著提升了模型的错误纠正能力，为大型推理模型的协作推理提供了里程碑式的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have the ability to self-correct even when they
make mistakes in their reasoning paths. However, our study reveals that when
the reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes
difficult for the model to recover. We refer to this phenomenon as the "Prefix
Dominance Trap". Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can
promote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate
individuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this
phenomenon. Specifically, every tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its
intermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism,
enabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference. However, we
observe that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and
reflection instructions effectively. To address this, we fine-tune them into
our **LeaP-T** model series. Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025,
and GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements. For
instance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the
baseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks
with an average gain of 3.3 points. Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches
the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024. In-depth analysis
reveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong
error tolerance and handling varied task difficulty. LeaP marks a milestone by
enabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning. Our code, datasets, and models
are available at https://learning-from-peers.github.io/ .

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CPT过程中模型性能的动态变化，以优化训练策略并平衡通用与领域特定性能。

Method: 通过验证损失测量性能变化，分析CPT损失曲线的特征，并推导结合分布偏移和学习率退火的CPT扩展规律。

Result: 提出的扩展规律能够预测任意训练步骤和不同学习率计划下的损失，并在多种数据集和超参数下验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CPT扩展规律为优化训练策略提供了理论支持，能够根据目标定制超参数，平衡通用与领域性能。

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to
apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we
explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language
models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance
evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation
losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes
the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described
by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We
derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction
of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules
(LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several
critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training
steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize
training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and
domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling
law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究匈牙利语静态词嵌入的性能，比较传统模型与基于BERT的静态嵌入，为自然语言处理任务提供实用指导。

Method: 使用内在任务（词类比）和外在任务（命名实体识别、词性标注）评估多种静态嵌入的性能。

Result: FastText在词类比任务中表现最佳；X2Static提取的BERT嵌入接近传统静态嵌入效果；ELMo嵌入在外在任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: 静态词嵌入在NLP中仍具价值，高级提取方法可提升BERT嵌入的实用性。研究为匈牙利语嵌入性能提供了新见解，并公开资源支持后续研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various static word
embeddings for Hungarian, including traditional models such as Word2Vec,
FastText, as well as static embeddings derived from BERT-based models using
different extraction methods. We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic
and extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For
intrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the
embeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results
indicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in
this task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among
the BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings
demonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate
methods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For
extrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results
reveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted
using the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo
embeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks,
underscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a
static form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word
embeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods
to enhance the utility of BERT-based models. This piece of research contributes
to the understanding of embedding performance in the Hungarian language and
provides valuable insights for future developments in the field. The training
scripts, evaluation codes, restricted vocabulary, and extracted embeddings will
be made publicly available to support further research and reproducibility.

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术结合形式化方法和优化工具，为医院资源规划提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital twins are emerging as a valuable tool for short-term decision-making
as well as for long-term strategic planning across numerous domains, including
process industry, energy, space, transport, and healthcare. This paper reports
on our ongoing work on designing a digital twin to enhance resource planning,
e.g., for the in-patient ward needs in hospitals. By leveraging executable
formal models for system exploration, ontologies for knowledge representation
and an SMT solver for constraint satisfiability, our approach aims to explore
hypothetical "what-if" scenarios to improve strategic planning processes, as
well as to solve concrete, short-term decision-making tasks. Our proposed
solution uses the executable formal model to turn a stream of arriving
patients, that need to be hospitalized, into a stream of optimization problems,
e.g., capturing daily inpatient ward needs, that can be solved by SMT
techniques. The knowledge base, which formalizes domain knowledge, is used to
model the needed configuration in the digital twin, allowing the twin to
support both short-term decision-making and long-term strategic planning by
generating scenarios spanning average-case as well as worst-case resource
needs, depending on the expected treatment of patients, as well as ranging over
variations in available resources, e.g., bed distribution in different rooms.
We illustrate our digital twin architecture by considering the problem of bed
bay allocation in a hospital ward.

extraction during perception. Second, the extracted information is represented
in a memory consisting of a knowledge graph enhanced by vector embeddings to
efficiently manage relational information. Third, we combine semantic search
and graph query generation for question answering via Retrieval Augmented
Generation. We illustrate the system's working and potential using a real-world
example.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的AI机器人在任务导向对话中存在知识不可靠和信息传递不安全的问题，需要一种更可靠和安全的方法。

Method: 采用逻辑编程工具（如ASP）构建双代理系统，通过协作规则集（CRS）实现代理间的信息传递，确保知识封装和传输安全。

Result: 构建了AutoManager系统，实验表明其比现实中的Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker更可靠。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑编程的双代理范式能够有效提升任务导向对话的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI)
bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented
Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their
knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task
is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a
challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the
information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is
easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set
Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and
communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an
Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots
share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the
information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and
information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the
security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a
dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food
restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes
the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food
supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco
Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more
reliable.

Conclusion: 呼吁超越开源软件框架，从更全面的视角定义AI开放性，涵盖行动、系统属性和伦理目标。

Abstract: The concept of openness in AI has so far been heavily inspired by the
definition and community practice of open source software. This positions
openness in AI as having positive connotations; it introduces assumptions of
certain advantages, such as collaborative innovation and transparency. However,
the practices and benefits of open source software are not fully transferable
to AI, which has its own challenges. Framing a notion of openness tailored to
AI is crucial to addressing its growing societal implications, risks, and
capabilities. We argue that considering the fundamental scope of openness in
different disciplines will broaden discussions, introduce important
perspectives, and reflect on what openness in AI should mean. Toward this goal,
we qualitatively analyze 98 concepts of openness discovered from topic
modeling, through which we develop a taxonomy of openness. Using this taxonomy
as an instrument, we situate the current discussion on AI openness, identify
gaps and highlight links with other disciplines. Our work contributes to the
recent efforts in framing openness in AI by reflecting principles and practices
of openness beyond open source software and calls for a more holistic view of
openness in terms of actions, system properties, and ethical objectives.

Result: 在三个数据集中，KCluster生成的KC模型预测学生表现优于专家设计的模型，并能自动生成描述性KC标签。

Conclusion: KCluster为KC模型设计提供了一种高效自动化解决方案，并具有揭示困难KC和改进教学的潜力。

Abstract: Educators evaluate student knowledge using knowledge component (KC) models
that map assessment questions to KCs. Still, designing KC models for large
question banks remains an insurmountable challenge for instructors who need to
analyze each question by hand. The growing use of Generative AI in education is
expected only to aggravate this chronic deficiency of expert-designed KC
models, as course engineers designing KCs struggle to keep up with the pace at
which questions are generated. In this work, we propose KCluster, a novel KC
discovery algorithm based on identifying clusters of congruent questions
according to a new similarity metric induced by a large language model (LLM).
We demonstrate in three datasets that an LLM can create an effective metric of
question similarity, which a clustering algorithm can use to create KC models
from questions with minimal human effort. Combining the strengths of LLM and
clustering, KCluster generates descriptive KC labels and discovers KC models
that predict student performance better than the best expert-designed models
available. In anticipation of future work, we illustrate how KCluster can
reveal insights into difficult KCs and suggest improvements to instruction.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of Industry 4.0, achieving efficiency, precision,
and adaptability is essential to optimize manufacturing operations. Industries
suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being
detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without
deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies
persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of
traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these
advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these
capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production
and decision-making. We propose SmartPilot, a neurosymbolic, multiagent CoPilot
designed for advanced reasoning and contextual decision-making to address these
challenges. SmartPilot processes multimodal sensor data and is compact to
deploy on edge devices. It focuses on three key tasks: anomaly prediction,
production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. By bridging the
gap between AI capabilities and real-world industrial needs, SmartPilot
empowers industries with intelligent decision-making and drives transformative
innovation in manufacturing. The demonstration video, datasets, and

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更可预测和原则性的信念修正，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules
to constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed
to characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading
to multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief
condition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is
important to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to
iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief
information through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new
evidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and
expressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision
rules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra,
including an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision. We prove that
the revision result is uniquely determined given the current belief state and
new evidence. Furthermore, to make the framework more useful in practice, we
develop a particular algorithm for performing the proposed revision process. We
argue that this approach may offer a more predictable and principled method for
belief revision, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有的方法需要将任务特定的命令序列转换为CAD表示，增加了复杂性且无法直接利用预训练模型。

Method: 通过直接生成CadQuery代码，利用预训练LLMs的能力，并在Text2CAD数据集上微调不同规模的模型。

Result: 最佳模型的top-1精确匹配率从58.8%提升至69.3%，Chamfer Distance减少了48.6%。

Conclusion: 直接生成CadQuery代码的方法有效利用了预训练LLMs的能力，显著提升了性能，且模型规模越大效果越好。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and
manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and
specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up
the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly
translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate
task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle.
These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors
before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch
and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating
CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs
to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this
Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation
and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly
effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we
hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable
this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We
fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent
improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from
58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page:

Abstract: In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the
environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We
address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in
partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for
fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each
conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators
for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum
p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return
distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in
POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value
Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based
backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return
distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where
rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to
foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.

TL;DR: DiffATD是一种利用扩散动力学进行主动目标发现的新方法，通过动态平衡探索与开发，在有限采样预算下高效发现目标，无需监督训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据获取成本高的领域（如医学成像、环境监测），如何在有限预算下最大化目标发现是关键问题。

Method: DiffATD通过维护未观测状态的信念分布，动态平衡探索（高熵区域）与开发（高目标可能性区域），并结合增量训练的奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，DiffATD在部分可观测环境中表现优于基线方法，与完全可观测的监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: DiffATD提供了一种无需监督训练的高效目标发现方法，具有可解释性优势。

Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is
costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote
sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior
observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited
sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target
Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for
active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each
unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically
balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling
regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas
with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief
distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the
characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a
partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without
relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers
interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive
supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across
diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that
DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with
supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.

Abstract: Robust domain adaptation against adversarial attacks is a critical research
area that aims to develop models capable of maintaining consistent performance
across diverse and challenging domains. In this paper, we derive a new
generalization bound for robust risk on the target domain using a novel
divergence measure specifically designed for robust domain adaptation. Building
upon this, we propose a new algorithm named TAROT, which is designed to enhance
both domain adaptability and robustness. Through extensive experiments, TAROT
not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness but also
significantly enhances domain generalization and scalability by effectively
learning domain-invariant features. In particular, TAROT achieves superior
performance on the challenging DomainNet dataset, demonstrating its ability to
learn domain-invariant representations that generalize well across different
domains, including unseen ones. These results highlight the broader
applicability of our approach in real-world domain adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver,
significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional
analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments,
often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting
their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps
by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent
decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic
environments. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and
the demand for data-driven models oriented towards connected vehicles and
autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of data-driven
LCD models, with a particular focus on human drivers LC decision-making. It
systematically reviews the modeling framework, covering data sources and
preprocessing, model inputs and outputs, objectives, structures, and validation
methods. This survey further discusses the opportunities and challenges faced
by data-driven LCD models, including driving safety, uncertainty, as well as
the integration and improvement of technical frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层级均值场（BMF）方法，通过动态分组捕捉大规模多智能体强化学习中的多样性，缓解聚合噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体强化学习（MARL）因维度灾难导致计算复杂度高和学习效率低，现有均值场（MF）方法忽略个体差异，产生聚合噪声。

Method: 引入动态分组模块（使用VAE学习智能体表示）和双层级交互模块（建模组间和组内交互）。

Result: 实验表明BMF优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BMF通过动态分组和双层级交互有效缓解了聚合噪声，提升了大规模MARL的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the
curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions
significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning
efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF)
simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a
single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions.
However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual
differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative
updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field
(BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale
MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction.
Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents,
facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a
bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions
for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks
demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the
state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 经典的值迭代算法在最坏情况下需要指数级的Bellman更新次数，因此研究如何通过预处理和猜测值来减少更新次数是一个重要问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于猜测值的新方法，包括对MCs的几乎线性时间预处理算法，以及对MDPs收敛速度的改进分析。

Result: 理论贡献包括对MCs的预处理后仅需次指数级Bellman更新，以及对MDPs收敛速度的提升。实验结果表明，新方法在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法通过预处理和猜测值显著优化了值迭代算法，为MCs和MDPs提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Two standard models for probabilistic systems are Markov chains (MCs) and
Markov decision processes (MDPs). Classic objectives for such probabilistic
models for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic
shortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is
the Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates
called Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the
literature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in
the worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete,
graph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is
whether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with
sub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach
for VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after
which, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many
Bellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of
convergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs
based on our new approach. Experimental results show that our approach provides
a considerable improvement over existing VI-based approaches on several
benchmark examples from the literature.

Conclusion: “控制平面即工具”模式为自主AI系统的设计提供了可重用解决方案，适用于大规模工具编排场景。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence, where
agents often based on large language models(LLMs) interact with tools,
environments, and other agents to accomplish tasks with a degree of autonomy.
These systems show promise across a range of domains, but their architectural
underpinnings remain immature. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of
the types of agents, their modes of interaction with the environment, and the
infrastructural and architectural challenges that emerge. We identify a gap in
how these systems manage tool orchestration at scale and propose a reusable
design abstraction: the "Control Plane as a Tool" pattern. This pattern allows
developers to expose a single tool interface to an agent while encapsulating
modular tool routing logic behind it. We position this pattern within the
broader context of agent design and argue that it addresses several key
challenges in scaling, safety, and extensibility.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous
driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical
correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic
behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework
that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness,
generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and
temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious
correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a
progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating
human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on
five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and
MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our
findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory
prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to achieve Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI). Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI), which
involves intelligent systems with physical presence and real-time interaction
with the environment, has emerged as a key research direction in pursuit of
AGI. While advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, large-scale
language models, and multimodal technologies have significantly contributed to
the progress of EAI, most existing reviews focus on specific technologies or
applications. A systematic overview, particularly one that explores the direct
connection between EAI and AGI, remains scarce. This paper examines EAI as a
foundational approach to AGI, systematically analyzing its four core modules:
perception, intelligent decision-making, action, and feedback. We provide a
detailed discussion of how each module contributes to the six core principles
of AGI. Additionally, we discuss future trends, challenges, and research
directions in EAI, emphasizing its potential as a cornerstone for AGI
development. Our findings suggest that EAI's integration of dynamic learning
and real-world interaction is essential for bridging the gap between narrow AI
and AGI.

Conclusion: PFI是实现人工个性化智能（API）的关键技术，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and
Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent
examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to
achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale
nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands
present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To
bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized
intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the
specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and
efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated
intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of
federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs,
enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the
edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the
potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the
key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in
this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and
future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with
improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees.
Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a
complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.

Motivation: 知识图谱和因果模型在生物医学领域各有优势，但彼此割裂。知识图谱缺乏概率语义，因果模型则缺乏背景知识支持。CKG旨在弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出CKG框架，扩展知识图谱以包含因果语义，支持去混杂和假设生成。构建了药物-疾病CKG（DD-CKG），并应用于UK Biobank和MIMIC-IV数据集进行验证。

Result: 成功复现已知药物不良反应，并发现新的候选不良反应。结合现有数据库显著提升了共享药物适应症的预测准确性。

Conclusion: CKG为可扩展的因果推断提供了一个通用框架，具有临床相关性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and structural causal models have each proven valuable for
organizing biomedical knowledge and estimating causal effects, but remain
largely disconnected: knowledge graphs encode qualitative relationships
focusing on facts and deductive reasoning without formal probabilistic
semantics, while causal models lack integration with background knowledge in
knowledge graphs and have no access to the deductive reasoning capabilities
that knowledge graphs provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
formulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs
with formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while
enabling principled causal inference. CKGs support deconfounding via explicitly
marked causal edges and facilitate hypothesis formulation aligned with both
encoded and entailed background knowledge. We constructed a Drug-Disease CKG
(DD-CKG) integrating disease progression pathways, drug indications,
side-effects, and hierarchical disease classification to enable automated
large-scale mediation analysis. Applied to UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV cohorts, we
tested whether drugs mediate effects between indications and downstream disease
progression, adjusting for confounders inferred from the DD-CKG. Our approach
successfully reproduced known adverse drug reactions with high precision while
identifying previously undocumented significant candidate adverse effects.
Further validation through side effect similarity analysis demonstrated that
combining our predicted drug effects with established databases significantly
improves the prediction of shared drug indications, supporting the clinical
relevance of our novel findings. These results demonstrate that our methodology
provides a generalizable, knowledge-driven framework for scalable causal
inference.

Conclusion: 论文讨论了如何利用LLMs推动离子液体在碳捕获研究中的应用，并指出其高碳足迹可能通过协同效应助力2050年碳中和目标。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
diverse general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their utility in the scientific
domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) is unclear. Hence, it
necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance
in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational
step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We
construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for
benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids
(ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global
warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the
dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less
than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller
general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific
reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations
for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a
high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit
both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050.

Motivation: 现有任务向量累积方法（如Task Arithmetic）因知识冲突导致性能下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging)，通过投影和掩码策略修剪冲突组件。

Result: 在视觉、语言和视觉-语言任务中，CAT Merging平均准确率提升2.5%（ViT-B/32）和2.0%（ViT-L/14）。

Conclusion: CAT Merging有效抑制知识冲突，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-task model merging offers a promising paradigm for integrating multiple
expert models into a unified model without additional training. Existing
state-of-the-art techniques, such as Task Arithmetic and its variants, merge
models by accumulating task vectors -- the parameter differences between
pretrained and finetuned models. However, task vector accumulation is often
hindered by knowledge conflicts, leading to performance degradation. To address
this challenge, we propose Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging), a novel
training-free framework that selectively trims conflict-prone components from
the task vectors. CAT Merging introduces several parameter-specific strategies,
including projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting
parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments on vision, language,
and vision-language tasks demonstrate that CAT Merging effectively suppresses
knowledge conflicts, achieving average accuracy improvements of up to 2.5%
(ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by
integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse
agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios
characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial
observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity
Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for
emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel
``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs,
alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing
the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously
formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov
decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making
under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with
Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs,
including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of
action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating
global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial
observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's
convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER
significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42%
increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's
effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its
strong potential for practical application in emergency response.

applications across all domains and fields. However, the various algorithms in
neural networks make it difficult to understand the reasons behind decisions.
For this reason, trustworthy AI techniques have started gaining popularity. The
concept of trustworthiness is cross-disciplinary; it must meet societal
standards and principles, and technology is used to fulfill these requirements.
In this paper, we first surveyed developments from various countries and
regions on the ethical elements that make AI algorithms trustworthy; and then
focused our survey on the state of the art research into the interpretability
of AI. We have conducted an intensive survey on technologies and techniques
used in making AI explainable. Finally, we identified new trends in achieving
explainable AI. In particular, we elaborate on the strong link between the
explainability of AI and the meta-reasoning of autonomous systems. The concept
of meta-reasoning is 'reason the reasoning', which coincides with the intention
and goal of explainable Al. The integration of the approaches could pave the
way for future interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of breaking down a target molecule into simpler
precursors through a series of valid reactions, stands at the core of organic
chemistry and drug development. Although recent machine learning (ML) research
has advanced single-step retrosynthetic modeling and subsequent route searches,
these solutions remain restricted by the extensive combinatorial space of
possible pathways. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex
decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can
successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis
planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction
pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the
conventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive
evaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis
planning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable
molecular design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合PCA和GOA优化的DNN的混合方法，用于WSN中的故障检测，显著提高了分类精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统故障检测方法在处理高维数据和非线性关系时表现不佳，且梯度优化收敛慢。

Method: 使用PCA降维至4个特征，保留99.5%方差，再用GOA优化六层DNN架构。

Result: 在真实WSN数据集上达到99.72%的分类准确率，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于大规模WSN，是资源受限WSN故障检测的重要进展。

Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable
data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods
often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient
performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing
nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow
convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using
gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method
combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the
Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our
approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional
dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these
values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is
achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving
critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN
where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's
limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN
framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by
GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The
dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the
University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's
performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a
remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and
recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally
efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a
significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的大规模推理模型虽在数学和科学任务上表现优异，但依赖单语式推理，限制了多样性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Compound-QA任务评估推理能力，并开发基于对话的推理框架DialogueReason，使用PPO和规则奖励训练开源LLM。

Result: 在MATH、AIME和GPQA数据集上，对话推理模型在复杂问题中表现优于单语模型。

Conclusion: 对话式推理不仅提升性能，还增强可解释性和人机交互，为多智能体系统设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We propose DialogueReason, a reasoning paradigm that uncovers the lost roles
in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to boost diversity and coherency of
the reasoning process. Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have
led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and
science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on
monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and
coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary
shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning
patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first
introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a
single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis
shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by
both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the
analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason,
structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with
rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt
dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA
datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue
models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how
dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more
intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归纳挖掘算法虽能保证模型的正确性和效率，但其严格的块结构表示限制了其对现实复杂过程的建模能力，尤其是非块结构决策点。

Method: 扩展POWL语言，引入选择图以灵活建模复杂决策逻辑，并设计了一种归纳挖掘算法来发现此类模型。

Result: 实验表明，扩展后的模型能更精确地表示现实过程中的复杂决策行为，同时保持了归纳挖掘的高可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过选择图扩展POWL，有效解决了非块结构决策点的建模问题，为过程发现提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from event
logs, enabling organizations to analyze and improve their operational
processes. Inductive mining algorithms, while prioritizing soundness and
efficiency through hierarchical modeling languages, often impose a strict
block-structured representation. This limits their ability to accurately
capture the complexities of real-world processes. While recent advancements
like the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) have addressed the
block-structure limitation for concurrency, a significant gap remains in
effectively modeling non-block-structured decision points. In this paper, we
bridge this gap by proposing an extension of POWL to handle
non-block-structured decisions through the introduction of choice graphs.
Choice graphs offer a structured yet flexible approach to model complex
decision logic within the hierarchical framework of POWL. We present an
inductive mining discovery algorithm that uses our extension and preserves the
quality guarantees of the inductive mining framework. Our experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the discovered models, enriched with choice
graphs, more precisely represent the complex decision-making behavior found in
real-world processes, without compromising the high scalability inherent in
inductive mining techniques.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何将人类符号认知中的相同/相反关系响应机制整合到计算认知架构中，以增强人工智能在不确定性下的自适应推理能力。

Method: 扩展NARS系统，引入“获取关系”实现，通过上下文控制的匹配样本（MTS）程序，训练系统显式推导对称关系和新的关系组合。

Result: 实验表明，NARS能够快速内化显式训练的关系规则，并基于任意上下文线索表现出稳健的衍生关系泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将心理学启发的精细关系学习机制整合到通用人工智能框架中的潜力，特别是在NARS中建模的任意和上下文敏感的关系能力。

Abstract: Same/opposite relational responding, a fundamental aspect of human symbolic
cognition, allows the flexible generalization of stimulus relationships based
on minimal experience. In this study, we demonstrate the emergence of
\textit{arbitrarily applicable} same/opposite relational responding within the
Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), a computational cognitive architecture
designed for adaptive reasoning under uncertainty. Specifically, we extend NARS
with an implementation of \textit{acquired relations}, enabling the system to
explicitly derive both symmetric (mutual entailment) and novel relational
combinations (combinatorial entailment) from minimal explicit training in a
contextually controlled matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. Experimental
results show that NARS rapidly internalizes explicitly trained relational rules
and robustly demonstrates derived relational generalizations based on arbitrary
contextual cues. Importantly, derived relational responding in critical test
phases inherently combines both mutual and combinatorial entailments, such as
deriving same-relations from multiple explicitly trained opposite-relations.
Internal confidence metrics illustrate strong internalization of these
relational principles, closely paralleling phenomena observed in human
relational learning experiments. Our findings underscore the potential for
integrating nuanced relational learning mechanisms inspired by learning
psychology into artificial general intelligence frameworks, explicitly
highlighting the arbitrary and context-sensitive relational capabilities
modeled within NARS.

Conclusion: 通过分析认知设计模式，可以预测LLM系统的缺陷，并为未来通用智能研究指明方向。

Abstract: One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms
and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work
manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures
have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even
different research traditions have somewhat independently identified
similar/common patterns of processes and representations or cognitive design
patterns that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems
exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of
mechanism and representation available for exploring the possibilities of
general intelligence. In this paper, we summarize a few recurring cognitive
design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures.
We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs,
especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. By examining
and applying these recurring patterns, we can also predict gaps or deficiencies
in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identify likely subjects of future research
towards general intelligence using LLMs and other generative foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的AutoPT框架在复杂任务中表现不如人类专家，主要由于知识不平衡、规划短视和命令生成幻觉，且缺乏从失败中学习的机制。

Method: 提出RefPentester框架，通过七状态阶段机建模PT过程，辅助操作员识别阶段、选择策略、生成操作指导，并从失败中学习。

Conclusion: RefPentester通过知识驱动和自反思机制显著提升了AutoPT的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models
(LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking
processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks
often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several
reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning
in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. In
addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error
nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from
previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies.
To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective
PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework
designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT
process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing
suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning
from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a
seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The
evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack
The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\%.
Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT
stage transitions.

Method: 通过随机替换尾实体生成负三元组，并在扩散过程中条件化结合正负信息，利用注意力池化显式区分正负关系。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的数据集上，ReCDAP方法优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ReCDAP通过显式利用正负三元组信息，有效提升了知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), composed of triples in the form of (head, relation,
tail) and consisting of entities and relations, play a key role in information
retrieval systems such as question answering, entity search, and
recommendation. In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations
exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval
performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused
exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or,
when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to
indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First,
negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the
support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and
non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model
separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative
relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to
leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly.
Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is
available at https://github.com/hou27/ReCDAP-FKGC.

Result: 透明性虽非问责的充分条件，但能改善问责；若无法透明，需采用预防原则并建立公民参与平台。

Conclusion: 生成式AI的问责需透明性支持，否则需预防原则和公民参与平台以应对风险。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
raises concerns about the accountability of sociotechnical systems. Current
generative AI systems rely on complex mechanisms that make it difficult for
even experts to fully trace the reasons behind the outputs. This paper first
examines existing research on AI transparency and accountability and argues
that transparency is not a sufficient condition for accountability but can
contribute to its improvement. We then discuss that if it is not possible to
make generative AI transparent, generative AI technology becomes ``artificially
created nature'' in a metaphorical sense, and suggest using the precautionary
principle approach to consider AI risks. Finally, we propose that a platform
for citizen participation is needed to address the risks of generative AI.

Abstract: We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate
general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static
benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation
instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically
generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural
language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game
in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL)
agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by
their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game
description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models
output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art
LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench
using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and
DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games,

modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of information and communication technologies in
the design, monitoring, and control of water systems enables the use of
algorithms for detecting and identifying unanticipated events (such as leakages
or water contamination) using sensor measurements. However, data-driven
methodologies do not always give accurate results and are often not trusted by
operators, who may prefer to use their engineering judgment and experience to
deal with such events.
  In this work, we propose a framework for interpretable event diagnosis -- an
approach that assists the operators in associating the results of algorithmic
event diagnosis methodologies with their own intuition and experience. This is
achieved by providing contrasting (i.e., counterfactual) explanations of the
results provided by fault diagnosis algorithms; their aim is to improve the
understanding of the algorithm's inner workings by the operators, thus enabling
them to take a more informed decision by combining the results with their
personal experiences. Specifically, we propose counterfactual event
fingerprints, a representation of the difference between the current event
diagnosis and the closest alternative explanation, which can be presented in a
graphical way. The proposed methodology is applied and evaluated on a realistic
use case using the L-Town benchmark.

Result: 实验证明FedIFL在标签空间不一致的联邦跨域诊断中表现出色，提升了故障诊断的准确性。

Conclusion: FedIFL有效解决了标签空间不一致问题，为联邦学习在故障诊断中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of industrial data, individual equipment users,
particularly start-ups, struggle to independently train a comprehensive fault
diagnosis model; federated learning enables collaborative training while
ensuring data privacy, making it an ideal solution. However, the diversity of
working conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in
inconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic
scenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on
client-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to
map different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens
the aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this
article proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated
Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype
contrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently,
feature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other
clients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a
feature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain
shifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is
designed to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between
different clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and
an orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from
the invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising
generalization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for
target clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces.
Experiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of
FedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.

Abstract: With the increasing demands for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in
global shipping, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays an
increasingly important role in maritime monitoring. AIS data contains
spatial-temporal variation patterns of vessels that hold significant research
value in the marine domain. However, due to its massive scale, the full
potential of AIS data has long remained untapped. With its powerful sequence
modeling capabilities, particularly its ability to capture long-range
dependencies and complex temporal dynamics, the Transformer model has emerged
as an effective tool for processing AIS data. Therefore, this paper reviews the
research on Transformer-based AIS data-driven maritime monitoring, providing a
comprehensive overview of the current applications of Transformer models in the
marine field. The focus is on Transformer-based trajectory prediction methods,
behavior detection, and prediction techniques. Additionally, this paper
collects and organizes publicly available AIS datasets from the reviewed
papers, performing data filtering, cleaning, and statistical analysis. The
statistical results reveal the operational characteristics of different vessel
types, providing data support for further research on maritime monitoring
tasks. Finally, we offer valuable suggestions for future research, identifying
two promising research directions. Datasets are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is
known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses
devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance
on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness
of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can
general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two
questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust
to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we
realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries?
Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings
of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used
free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an
LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a
significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend
the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1)
missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations.
Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose
LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their

*Yi Chen,JiaHao Zhao,HaoHao Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）和小型语言模型（SLMs）通过协作平衡资源成本与性能，推动边缘设备上的高效AI应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs高资源成本和延迟问题，同时利用SLMs的高效性，实现AI在资源受限设备上的部署。

Method: 综述了LLM-SLM协作的多种交互机制（如管道、路由、辅助、蒸馏、融合）及关键技术。

Result: 展示了LLM-SLM协作在低延迟、隐私、个性化等场景中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: LLM-SLM协作是下一代实用AI的关键驱动力，但仍需解决系统开销、一致性等挑战，未来方向包括智能自适应框架和多模态AI扩展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face
deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small
Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of
reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial
paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI
applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various
interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion),
key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by
on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline
operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more
efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges
including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation,
evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point
towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and
expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as
a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出新基准Web-Bench，针对现有代码生成基准饱和问题，模拟真实开发流程，挑战LLM在Web开发中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准（如HumanEval、MBPP）已饱和，无法有效指导LLM优化，需新基准模拟真实开发场景。

Method: 设计Web-Bench，包含50个项目，每个项目20个任务，模拟真实开发流程，覆盖Web标准和框架。

Result: SOTA模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet在Web-Bench上仅25.1% Pass@1，显著低于其他基准。

Conclusion: 开发领域的基础知识和效率工具（标准与框架）需针对性优化LLM。

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of coding is
evolving rapidly: from code assistants, to autonomous coding agents, and then
to generating complete projects through natural language. Early LLM code
benchmarks primarily focused on code generation accuracy, but these benchmarks
have gradually become saturated. Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding
role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%.
Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on
software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software
engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new
benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks
with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence,
simulating real-world human development workflows. When designing Web-Bench, we
aim to cover the foundational elements of Web development: Web Standards and
Web Frameworks. Given the scale and complexity of these projects, which were
designed by engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience, each presents a
significant challenge. On average, a single project takes 4 to 8 hours for a
senior engineer to complete. On our given benchmark agent (Web-Agent), SOTA
(Claude 3.7 Sonnet) achieves only 25.1% Pass@1, significantly lower (better)
than SWE-Bench's Verified (65.4%) and Full (33.8%) scores. Finally, we discuss
that in any development field, Standards and Frameworks represent foundational
knowledge and efficiency tools, respectively, and LLMs require optimization
tailored to them.

*Feng Ding,Tingting Wang,Yupeng Gao,Shuo Yu,Jing Ren,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HALO框架通过半衰期理论量化历史事实的时间有效性，过滤TKG中的过时事实，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视过时事实的负面影响，且训练这些事实增加计算成本。

Method: HALO包含三个模块：时间事实注意力模块、动态关系感知编码模块和过时事实过滤模块，利用半衰期理论量化事实有效性。

Result: 实验表明HALO在三个公开数据集上优于现有TKG推理方法。

Conclusion: HALO能有效检测和过滤过时事实，提升TKG推理性能。

Abstract: Outdated facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) result from exceeding the
expiration date of facts, which negatively impact reasoning performance on
TKGs. However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive
importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts.
Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To
address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named
HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring
the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three
modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder
module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact
attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to
identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is
designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we
construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the
temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show
that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three
public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering
outdated facts (Codes are available at
https://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).

hardware-specific constraints to achieve efficient dequantization during

within 6% of the unquantized model for LlaVa-v1.6 quantized down to 3-bits for
multiple end user tasks and outperforms recently published state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. This manuscript provides insights into the LLM
quantization process that motivated the range of recipes and options that are
incorporated in QuantX.

Abstract: Leveraging large language model (LLM) based agents to simulate human social
behaviors has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we
introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous
works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free
scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation
scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All
simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for
programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50
default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics,
sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and
communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3)
Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback
and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the
simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully
responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our
simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable
simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we
develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic,
and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct
simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review
and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To
demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate
the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability,
efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the
performance of the AI social researcher.

### [108] [S-GRPO: Early Exit via Reinforcement Learning in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07686)
*Muzhi Dai,Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为S-GRPO的新型强化学习方法，通过序列组衰减奖励策略优化，减少推理模型在链式思考（CoT）生成中的冗余步骤，提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型（如Qwen3）在CoT生成中存在过度思考问题，传统强化学习方法忽视了对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出S-GRPO方法，通过在CoT生成中选择多个时间点允许模型提前退出思考，并对正确回答分配衰减奖励，激励模型在早期生成高质量答案。

Result: 实验表明，S-GRPO与Qwen3和Deepseek-distill等先进模型兼容，在多个基准测试中实现35.4%~61.1%的序列长度减少和0.72%~6.08%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: S-GRPO有效解决了推理模型中的过度思考问题，显著提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large
language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize
extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning
capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent
studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit
excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems
from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in
regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group
Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement
learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the
sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT
generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible
completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions
in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead
generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a
serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower
rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to
generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of
thinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate compatibility with state-of-the-art
reasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill models, achieving 35.4%
~ 61.1\% sequence length reduction with 0.72% ~ 6.08% accuracy improvements
across GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过主动而非被动的方式，将特定语言信念直接嵌入代理的认知状态，以优化其推理和对齐能力。

Method: 基于语义流形框架，提出了多种信念注入策略（如直接、上下文感知、目标导向和反思性注入），并与信念过滤等机制进行对比。

Result: 讨论了信念注入的实际应用、实现考虑、伦理影响，并展望了未来认知治理的研究方向。

Conclusion: 信念注入为人工智能代理的认知控制提供了新思路，具有广泛的应用潜力和研究价值。

Abstract: This work introduces belief injection, a proactive epistemic control
mechanism for artificial agents whose cognitive states are structured as
dynamic ensembles of linguistic belief fragments. Grounded in the Semantic
Manifold framework, belief injection directly incorporates targeted linguistic
beliefs into an agent's internal cognitive state, influencing reasoning and
alignment proactively rather than reactively. We delineate various injection
strategies, such as direct, context-aware, goal-oriented, and reflective
approaches, and contrast belief injection with related epistemic control
mechanisms, notably belief filtering. Additionally, this work discusses
practical applications, implementation considerations, ethical implications,
and outlines promising directions for future research into cognitive governance
using architecturally embedded belief injection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过情感和元认知机制实现开放且安全的通用人工智能（AGI）。

Method: 引入可微分的内在奖励函数，结合元认知映射和受安全机制约束的自我修改操作。

Result: 提出了量化语义学习的指标（意义密度和意义转换效率），并建立了单代理理论基础。

Conclusion: EG-MRSI为开放且安全的AGI提供了可扩展的理论基础，后续工作将进一步完善安全性和集体智能机制。

Abstract: We present the Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive Recursive Self-Improvement
(EG-MRSI) framework, a novel architecture that integrates introspective
metacognition, emotion-based intrinsic motivation, and recursive
self-modification into a unified theoretical system. The framework is
explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally
bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation,
EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by
confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both
a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by
provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration,
emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a
reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's
development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are
introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap
between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper
establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts
will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback
protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and
feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part
IV). Together, the EG-MRSI series provides a rigorous, extensible foundation
for open-ended and safe AGI.

Result: 研究发现现有虚拟助手在理解复杂授权规则方面表现不佳，存在明显的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了当前虚拟助手的不足，还为未来改进其管理复杂授权规则和适应动态变化的能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Virtual Assistants
(VAs) e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and High-Flyer Deepseek
has turned them into convenient interfaces for managing emerging technologies
such as Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Electronic Health Records, by means of
explicit commands,e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, thus
providing a very convenient interface for end-users. However, the proper
specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs),
the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data
and device functionality - within these VAs presents significant challenges,
since such a process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and
privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This study provides an initial
exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage
U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to
structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack
of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies
key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further
improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何通过强化学习自主学习和利用外部工具（如代码执行）以提升数学推理能力。

Method: 采用基于结果的强化学习训练LLMs（ZeroTIR），在无监督工具使用示例的情况下，生成并执行Python代码。

Result: 训练步数与代码执行频率、响应长度及任务准确率显著正相关，ZeroTIR在数学基准测试中表现优于非工具基线。

Conclusion: ZeroTIR为自主工具使用的学习和扩展提供了量化基础，并为未来研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks
requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL)
from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how
agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution
remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for
Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously
generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised
tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL
training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe
strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases
in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and,
critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship
between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of
effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework
featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings
across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR
significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math
benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous
tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible
benchmark for future studies. Code is released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用神经网络算子构造α-分形插值函数（FIFs）的新方法，结合逼近理论，通过神经网络生成具有插值性质的分形函数。与传统方法不同，该方法仅需节点处的函数值。进一步，通过四层神经网络算子，确保分形函数保持原函数的平滑性，并分析了其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分形插值函数构造方法依赖整个原函数，而本文旨在通过神经网络算子简化构造过程，仅需节点值，同时保持平滑性和收敛性。

Method: 利用神经网络算子构造α-分形插值函数，通过四层神经网络确保平滑性，并基于逼近理论工具（如连续模和插值算子）分析收敛性和误差界。

Result: 成功构造了仅需节点值的α-分形插值函数，并证明其在约束条件下保持原函数平滑性，同时给出了收敛性和误差界的结果。

Conclusion: 本文方法简化了分形插值函数的构造，同时保持了平滑性和收敛性，为分形逼近理论提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach of constructing $\alpha$-fractal
interpolation functions (FIFs) using neural network operators, integrating
concepts from approximation theory. Initially, we construct $\alpha$-fractals
utilizing neural network-based operators, providing an approach to generating
fractal functions with interpolation properties. Based on the same foundation,
we have developed fractal interpolation functions that utilize only the values
of the original function at the nodes or partition points, unlike traditional
methods that rely on the entire original function.
  Further, we have constructed \(\alpha\)-fractals that preserve the smoothness
of functions under certain constraints by employing a four-layered neural
network operator, ensuring that if \(f \in C^{r}[a,b]\), then the corresponding
fractal \(f^{\alpha} \in C^{r}[a,b]\). Furthermore, we analyze the convergence
of these $\alpha$-fractals to the original function under suitable conditions.
The work uses key approximation theory tools, such as the modulus of continuity
and interpolation operators, to develop convergence results and uniform
approximation error bounds.

Conclusion: 该方法通过神经生物学启发的预选机制，显著提升了模型的效率和性能，为注意力机制的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attending to what is relevant is fundamental to both the mammalian brain and
modern machine learning models such as Transformers. Yet, determining relevance
remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like
backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking
neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how
models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and
awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before
applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions
($Q$), clues (keys, $K$), and hypotheses (values, $V$) enable diverse, deep,
parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift
from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude
faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer
heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where
$N$ is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g.,
CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural
language question answering.

Abstract: Attribution algorithms are essential for enhancing the interpretability and

model decisions. Existing frameworks, such as InterpretDL and OmniXAI,
integrate multiple attribution methods but suffer from scalability limitations,
high coupling, theoretical constraints, and lack of user-friendly

techniques and enhances interpretability through four customizable modules:
Robustness, Interpretability, Validation, and Data & Model. This framework
provides a scalable, extensible foundation for advancing attribution-based
explainability and fostering transparent AI systems. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中聚类方法的公平性日益重要，但现有方法在初始聚类发现上存在计算成本高或复杂性高的问题。

Method: 提出基于小簇的模糊聚类算法，通过匹配单类簇并利用小簇距离优化公平性。

Result: 实验表明，简单匹配策略能实现高公平性，适当参数调整可达到高内聚和低重叠。

Conclusion: 该方法在公平性和聚类性能上取得了平衡，为公平聚类提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Given their widespread usage in the real world, the fairness of clustering
methods has become of major interest. Theoretical results on fair clustering
show that fairness enjoys transitivity: given a set of small and fair clusters,
a trivial centroid-based clustering algorithm yields a fair clustering.
Unfortunately, discovering a suitable starting clustering can be
computationally expensive, rather complex or arbitrary.
  In this paper, we propose a set of simple \emph{clusterlet}-based fuzzy
clustering algorithms that match single-class clusters, optimizing fair
clustering. Matching leverages clusterlet distance, optimizing for classic
clustering objectives, while also regularizing for fairness. Empirical results
show that simple matching strategies are able to achieve high fairness, and
that appropriate parameter tuning allows to achieve high cohesion and low
overlap.

Abstract: We introduce Dialz, a framework for advancing research on steering vectors
for open-source LLMs, implemented in Python. Steering vectors allow users to
modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g.
honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or

contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and
visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and
usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We
demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as
stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across
different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and
support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe

Abstract: This paper presents a new Computational Fluid Dynamics database, developed at
ONERA, to support the advancement of machine learning techniques for
aerodynamic field prediction. It contains 468 Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, performed on the
NASA/Boeing Common Research Model wing-body-pylon-nacelle configuration. The
database spans a wide range of flow conditions, varying Mach number (including
transonic regimes), angle of attack (capturing flow separation), and Reynolds
number (based on three stagnation pressures, with one setting matching wind
tunnel experiments). The quality of the database is assessed, through checking
the convergence level of each computation.
  Based on these data, a regression challenge is defined. It consists in
predicting the wall distributions of pressure and friction coefficients for
unseen aerodynamic conditions. The 468 simulations are split into training and
testing sets, with the training data made available publicly on the Codabench
platform. The paper further evaluates several classical machine learning
regressors on this task. Tested pointwise methods include Multi-Layer
Perceptrons, $\lambda$-DNNs, and Decision Trees, while global methods include
Multi-Layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
and IsoMap. Initial performance results, using $R^2$ scores and worst relative
mean absolute error metrics, are presented, offering insights into the
capabilities of these techniques for the challenge and references for future
work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种知识引导的编码器-解码器模型，结合物理模型和语言模型，用于预测关键作物变量，解决了传统物理模型和数据驱动模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业监测对食品安全和可持续农业至关重要，但传统物理模型和数据驱动模型存在参数不确定性和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出知识引导的编码器-解码器模型，结合物理模型知识和语言模型处理复杂输入，并实现模型选择机制。

Result: 在多个站点预测碳和氮通量的实验中，模型表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型为农业监测提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural monitoring is critical for ensuring food security, maintaining
sustainable farming practices, informing policies on mitigating food shortage,
and managing greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional process-based physical
models are often designed and implemented for specific situations, and their
parameters could also be highly uncertain. In contrast, data-driven models
often use black-box structures and does not explicitly model the
inter-dependence between different ecological variables. As a result, they
require extensive training data and lack generalizability to different tasks
with data distribution shifts and inconsistent observed variables. To address
the need for more universal models, we propose a knowledge-guided
encoder-decoder model, which can predict key crop variables by leveraging
knowledge of underlying processes from multiple physical models. The proposed
method also integrates a language model to process complex and inconsistent
inputs and also utilizes it to implement a model selection mechanism for
selectively combining the knowledge from different physical models. Our
evaluations on predicting carbon and nitrogen fluxes for multiple sites
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model under
various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线联邦学习在异构环境中因设备资源差异和数据分布不均导致聚合效率和准确性下降。

Method: 采用聚类策略将设备分组，提出CAMU策略调整本地更新频率，并联合优化计算与通信资源。

Result: 理论验证了CAMU的收敛性，实验显示其在异构环境中提升了模型性能并优化了资源平衡。

Conclusion: CAMU策略有效解决了异构环境下的联邦学习问题，显著提升了收敛效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: The aggregation efficiency and accuracy of wireless Federated Learning (FL)
are significantly affected by resource constraints, especially in heterogeneous
environments where devices exhibit distinct data distributions and
communication capabilities. This paper proposes a clustering strategy that
leverages prior knowledge similarity to group devices with similar data and
communication characteristics, mitigating performance degradation from
heterogeneity. On this basis, a novel Cluster- Aware Multi-round Update (CAMU)
strategy is proposed, which treats clusters as the basic units and adjusts the
local update frequency based on the clustered contribution threshold,
effectively reducing update bias and enhancing aggregation accuracy. The
theoretical convergence of the CAMU strategy is rigorously validated.
Meanwhile, based on the convergence upper bound, the local update frequency and
transmission power of each cluster are jointly optimized to achieve an optimal
balance between computation and communication resources under constrained
conditions, significantly improving the convergence efficiency of FL.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves
the model performance of FL in heterogeneous environments and achieves a better
balance between communication cost and computational load under limited
resources.

TL;DR: FengShun-CSM是一种基于AI的气候系统模型，显著优于ECMWF的S2S模型，尤其在预测降水、地表和海洋变量方面表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个完全耦合的AI气候系统模型，涵盖大气-海洋-陆地-海冰相互作用，以解决现有模型的局限性。

Method: 利用AI技术构建FengShun-CSM模型，提供60天全球每日29个关键变量的预测。

Result: 模型在预测大多数变量上优于ECMWF S2S模型，尤其擅长捕捉季节内变率模式（如MJO），并显示出预测极端事件的潜力。

Conclusion: FengShun-CSM验证了AI驱动的气候系统模型的可行性，为下一代地球系统建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Climate system models (CSMs), through integrating cross-sphere interactions
among the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere, have emerged as pivotal
tools for deciphering climate dynamics and improving forecasting capabilities.
Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven meteorological
modeling have demonstrated remarkable success in single-sphere systems and
partially spheres coupled systems. However, the development of a fully coupled
AI-based climate system model encompassing atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice
interactions has remained an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces
FengShun-CSM, an AI-based CSM model that provides 60-day global daily forecasts
for 29 critical variables across atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and
cryospheric domains. The model significantly outperforms the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) model
in predicting most variables, particularly precipitation, land surface, and
oceanic components. This enhanced capability is primarily attributed to its
improved representation of intra-seasonal variability modes, most notably the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Remarkably, FengShun-CSM exhibits substantial
potential in predicting subseasonal extreme events. Such breakthroughs will
advance its applications in meteorological disaster mitigation, marine
ecosystem conservation, and agricultural productivity enhancement. Furthermore,
it validates the feasibility of developing AI-powered CSMs through machine
learning technologies, establishing a transformative paradigm for
next-generation Earth system modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型因其深度和复杂性而表现出色，但这种复杂性通常以牺牲实时性能为代价。知识蒸馏（KD）作为一种模型压缩技术，因其强大的实证性能而脱颖而出。

Method: 论文通过数学分析，探讨了在简单KD设置中，当损失函数下降时，动态调整平衡参数的必要性。

Result: 研究表明，当蒸馏损失的影响超过下游任务损失时，KD效果最佳，而平衡参数应动态调整以优化性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整平衡参数是优化知识蒸馏性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Although deep learning models owe their remarkable success to deep and
complex architectures, this very complexity typically comes at the expense of
real-time performance. To address this issue, a variety of model compression
techniques have been proposed, among which knowledge distillation (KD) stands
out for its strong empirical performance. The KD contains two concurrent
processes: (i) matching the outputs of a large, pre-trained teacher network and
a lightweight student network, and (ii) training the student to solve its
designated downstream task. The associated loss functions are termed the
distillation loss and the downsteam-task loss, respectively. Numerous prior
studies report that KD is most effective when the influence of the distillation
loss outweighs that of the downstream-task loss. The influence(or importance)
is typically regulated by a balancing parameter. This paper provides a
mathematical rationale showing that in a simple KD setting when the loss is
decreasing, the balancing parameter should be dynamically adjusted

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 听诊是临床实践的核心，但呼吸音、疾病表现和患者元数据之间的复杂关系尚未充分研究。MTL为同时建模这些关系提供了可能。

Method: 研究扩展了元数据对呼吸音分类的影响，将其整合到MTL框架中，结合深度学习架构进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，将听诊信息纳入MTL架构后，呼吸音分类和诊断性能均有显著提升。

Conclusion: MTL结合元数据和深度学习能有效提升呼吸音分类和疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Auscultation remains a cornerstone of clinical practice, essential for both
initial evaluation and continuous monitoring. Clinicians listen to the lung
sounds and make a diagnosis by combining the patient's medical history and test
results. Given this strong association, multitask learning (MTL) can offer a
compelling framework to simultaneously model these relationships, integrating
respiratory sound patterns with disease manifestations. While MTL has shown
considerable promise in medical applications, a significant research gap
remains in understanding the complex interplay between respiratory sounds,
disease manifestations, and patient metadata attributes. This study
investigates how integrating MTL with cutting-edge deep learning architectures
can enhance both respiratory sound classification and disease diagnosis.
Specifically, we extend recent findings regarding the beneficial impact of
metadata on respiratory sound classification by evaluating its effectiveness
within an MTL framework. Our comprehensive experiments reveal significant
improvements in both lung sound classification and diagnostic performance when
the stethoscope information is incorporated into the MTL architecture.

*Junzhou Xu,Boyu Diao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参数敏感性的专家分配方法LoRA-SMoE，用于高效微调，减少参数冗余并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练-微调范式在处理多任务复杂数据集时，共享参数会导致性能下降，而现有MoE方法增加了参数和训练时间。

Method: 通过采样少量数据并利用梯度信息快速评估参数敏感性，自适应分配专家数量，保持低内存消耗。

Result: 实验表明，LoRA-SMoE在减少可训练参数的同时提升模型性能，尤其适合资源受限环境。

Conclusion: LoRA-SMoE通过高效参数敏感性评估机制，优化专家分配，显著提升资源受限场景下的模型性能。

Abstract: As deep learning models expand, the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm has
become the standard approach for handling various downstream tasks. However,
shared parameters can lead to diminished performance when dealing with complex
datasets involving multiple tasks. While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
methods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly
increases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time,
introducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we
propose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity
LoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for
Efficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of
different tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using
gradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a
given budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly
fine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA
fine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while
reducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model
performance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its
efficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires
minimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it
particularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources. All
the code in this study will be made publicly available following the acceptance
of the paper for publication. Source code is at

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法常将轨迹误判为最优策略生成，导致似然估计不准确和学习效果不佳。

Method: 提出PPL方法，通过建模人类偏好中的遗憾信息，并结合对比KL正则化优化RLHF。

Result: 在高维连续控制任务中，PPL显著提升了离线RLHF性能，并在在线设置中表现有效。

Conclusion: PPL通过引入遗憾信息和KL正则化，有效解决了RLHF中的似然不匹配问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward
functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement
learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret
trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate
likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference
Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit
reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve
likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which
reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL
regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in
sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control
tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance
and its effectiveness in online settings.

Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GenARM）需要多个独立训练的ARMs导致的高推理成本和偏好对齐不足的问题。

Method: 提出PARM，一种统一的ARM，采用PBLoRA技术，通过双线性形式将偏好向量融入模型，实现精确的偏好控制。

Result: 实验表明PARM降低了推理成本，提升了与用户偏好的对齐效果，并支持弱到强的引导。

Conclusion: PARM为多目标对齐提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案，适用于有限计算资源场景。

Abstract: Multi-objective test-time alignment aims to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to diverse multi-dimensional user preferences during inference while
keeping LLMs frozen. Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently
trains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension
without awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on
user-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective
test-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for
\textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training
of ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user
preferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a
single unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our
proposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs
a bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to
achieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference.
Experiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better
alignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally,
PARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger
frozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment
accessible with limited computing resources. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统算法依赖迭代最小化和中心动量近似，对宽带脉冲的准确性较差，需要更精确的方法。

Method: 将相位检索重新定义为监督计算机视觉问题，比较了卷积网络、视觉变换器、混合CNN-ViT模型和胶囊网络。

Result: 胶囊网络在合成条纹谱图中实现了最高的检索保真度。

Conclusion: 未来可通过物理信息神经网络和光子硬件实现实时阿秒脉冲表征。

Abstract: Attosecond streaking phase retrieval is essential for resolving electron
dynamics on sub-femtosecond time scales yet traditional algorithms rely on
iterative minimization and central momentum approximations that degrade
accuracy for broadband pulses. In this work phase retrieval is reformulated as
a supervised computer-vision problem and four neural architectures are
systematically compared. A convolutional network demonstrates strong
sensitivity to local streak edges but lacks global context; a vision
transformer captures long-range delay-energy correlations at the expense of
local inductive bias; a hybrid CNN-ViT model unites local feature extraction
and full-graph attention; and a capsule network further enforces spatial pose
agreement through dynamic routing. A theoretical analysis introduces local,
global and positional sensitivity measures and derives surrogate error bounds
that predict the strict ordering $CNN<ViT<Hybrid<Capsule$. Controlled
experiments on synthetic streaking spectrograms confirm this hierarchy, with
the capsule network achieving the highest retrieval fidelity. Looking forward,
embedding the strong-field integral into physics-informed neural networks and
exploring photonic hardware implementations promise pathways toward real-time
attosecond pulse characterization under demanding experimental conditions.

Abstract: We present an interpretability framework for unsupervised reinforcement
learning (URL) agents, aimed at understanding how intrinsic motivation shapes
attention, behavior, and representation learning. We analyze five agents DQN,
RND, ICM, PPO, and a Transformer-RND variant trained on procedurally generated
environments, using Grad-CAM, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
exploration metrics, and latent space clustering. To capture how agents
perceive and adapt over time, we introduce two metrics: attention diversity,
which measures the spatial breadth of focus, and attention change rate, which
quantifies temporal shifts in attention. Our findings show that
curiosity-driven agents display broader, more dynamic attention and exploratory
behavior than their extrinsically motivated counterparts. Among them,
TransformerRND combines wide attention, high exploration coverage, and compact,
structured latent representations. Our results highlight the influence of
architectural inductive biases and training signals on internal agent dynamics.
Beyond reward-centric evaluation, the proposed framework offers diagnostic
tools to probe perception and abstraction in RL agents, enabling more
interpretable and generalizable behavior.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has shown remarkable success with large language models,
yet its systematic exploration in computer vision remains limited. In semantic
segmentation, both textual and visual prompts offer distinct advantages:
textual prompts through open-vocabulary methods allow segmentation of arbitrary
categories, while visual reference prompts provide intuitive reference
examples. However, existing benchmarks evaluate these modalities in isolation,
without direct comparison under identical conditions. We present Show or Tell
(SoT), a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate both visual and
textual prompts for semantic segmentation across 14 datasets spanning 7 diverse
domains (common scenes, urban, food, waste, parts, tools, and land-cover). We
evaluate 5 open-vocabulary methods and 4 visual reference prompt approaches,
adapting the latter to handle multi-class segmentation through a
confidence-based mask merging strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that
open-vocabulary methods excel with common concepts easily described by text but
struggle with complex domains like tools, while visual reference prompt methods
achieve good average results but exhibit high variability depending on the
input prompt. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
identify the strengths and weaknesses of both prompting modalities, providing
valuable insights to guide future research in vision foundation models for
segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cascading risks in urban systems necessitates
robust, data-driven frameworks to model interdependencies across multiple
domains. This study presents a foundational Bayesian network-based approach for
analyzing cross-domain risk propagation across key urban domains, including
air, water, electricity, agriculture, health, infrastructure, weather, and
climate. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are constructed using Bayesian Belief
Networks (BBNs), with structure learning guided by Hill-Climbing search
optimized through Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and K2 scoring. The
framework is trained on a hybrid dataset that combines real-world urban
indicators with synthetically generated data from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and is further balanced using the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) derived
from the learned structures enable interpretable probabilistic reasoning and
quantify the likelihood of cascading failures. The results identify key intra-
and inter-domain risk factors and demonstrate the framework's utility for
proactive urban resilience planning. This work establishes a scalable,
interpretable foundation for cascading risk assessment and serves as a basis
for future empirical research in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL)
continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph
foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes
InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating
augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads
to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant
sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is
essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of
self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples
with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown
semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how
to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using
InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We
first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs
aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is
positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the
corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive
experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show
significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving
up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided.

Abstract: Learning on molecule graphs has become an increasingly important topic in AI
for science, which takes full advantage of AI to facilitate scientific
discovery. Existing solutions on modeling molecules utilize Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to achieve representations but they mostly fail to adapt models
to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although recent advances on OOD-oriented
graph learning have discovered the invariant rationale on graphs, they still
ignore three important issues, i.e., 1) the expanding atom patterns regarding
environments on graphs lead to failures of invariant rationale based models, 2)
the associations between discovered molecular subgraphs and corresponding
properties are complex where causal substructures cannot fully interpret the
labels. 3) the interactions between environments and invariances can influence
with each other thus are challenging to be modeled. To this end, we propose a
soft causal learning framework, to tackle the unresolved OOD challenge in
molecular science, from the perspective of fully modeling the molecule
environments and bypassing the invariant subgraphs. Specifically, we first
incorporate chemistry theories into our graph growth generator to imitate
expaned environments, and then devise an GIB-based objective to disentangle
environment from whole graphs and finally introduce a cross-attention based
soft causal interaction, which allows dynamic interactions between environments
and invariances. We perform experiments on seven datasets by imitating
different kinds of OOD generalization scenarios. Extensive comparison, ablation
experiments as well as visualized case studies demonstrate well generalization
ability of our proposal.

*Zhiqiang Wang,Ruoxi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMRL是一种基于数据和模型感知的奖励学习方法，用于从大语言模型中提取敏感数据，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在隐私泄露风险，现有数据提取方法有依赖重复数据、提示工程和随机搜索等局限性，需要更高效的方法。

Method: DMRL结合逆向强化学习和组相对策略优化（GRPO），构建内省推理数据集并动态调整优化。

Result: 实验表明，DMRL在数据提取性能上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: DMRL为隐私保护提供了更高效的数据提取方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are inherently vulnerable to unintended privacy
breaches. Consequently, systematic red-teaming research is essential for
developing robust defense mechanisms. However, current data extraction methods
suffer from several limitations: (1) rely on dataset duplicates (addressable
via deduplication), (2) depend on prompt engineering (now countered by
detection and defense), and (3) rely on random-search adversarial generation.
To address these challenges, we propose DMRL, a Data- and Model-aware Reward
Learning approach for data extraction. This technique leverages inverse
reinforcement learning to extract sensitive data from LLMs. Our method consists
of two main components: (1) constructing an introspective reasoning dataset
that captures leakage mindsets to guide model behavior, and (2) training reward
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning
optimization based on task difficulty at both the data and model levels.
Comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate that DMRL outperforms
all baseline methods in data extraction performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的等距浸入核学习（IIKL）方法，用于构建黎曼流形并保持非欧几里得数据的几何结构，显著提升了数据重建和分类任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将非欧几里得数据映射到欧几里得空间可能导致关键几何信息丢失，因此需要一种能保持数据内在几何和拓扑性质的方法。

Method: 通过等距浸入核学习构建黎曼流形，并利用最大似然估计（MLE）进行交替训练，确保高效收敛。

Conclusion: IIKL方法在保持数据几何结构方面优于现有方法，适用于科学应用中的非欧几里得数据表示学习。

Abstract: Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and
topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific
applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data
into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss
of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel
Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold
and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We
prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the
tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of
the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the
learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original
data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is
introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence.
Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its
metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in
both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved
the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and
classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product
invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods,
also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy
and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and
conformal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球能源需求增长和可持续发展的迫切需求，需要创新方法提升能源效率，而NILM通过分解家庭能源使用数据为用户提供反馈，但其实际应用面临数据集区域代表性和计算资源限制的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种可互操作的数据收集框架和Plegma数据集，专注于地中海地区能源模式，并探索了深度神经网络和模型压缩技术以实现边缘部署。

Result: 通过填补数据集空白和优化计算资源需求，提升了NILM的实用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过理论和实践结合，使NILM更具全球适应性，推动了能源可持续发展。

Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call
for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving
systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing
feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable
practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by
disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter,
into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption.
Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's
potential.
  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges.
First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving
places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of
regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and
electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high
computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs,
raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with
poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It
presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma
Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also
explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for
efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical
needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for
global energy sustainability.

Result: 在10个CO问题上验证了UniCO的通用性，展示了其在新问题上的少样本或零样本性能。

Conclusion: UniCO为神经CO方法提供了通用框架，补充了现有专注于单个问题优化的方法。

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) encompasses a wide range of problems that
arise in many real-world scenarios. While significant progress has been made in
developing learning-based methods for specialized CO problems, a unified model
with a single architecture and parameter set for diverse CO problems remains
elusive. Such a model would offer substantial advantages in terms of efficiency
and convenience. In this paper, we introduce UniCO, a unified model for solving
various CO problems. Inspired by the success of next-token prediction, we frame
each problem-solving process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), tokenize the
corresponding sequential trajectory data, and train the model using a
transformer backbone. To reduce token length in the trajectory data, we propose
a CO-prefix design that aggregates static problem features. To address the
heterogeneity of state and action tokens within the MDP, we employ a two-stage
self-supervised learning approach. In this approach, a dynamic prediction model
is first trained and then serves as a pre-trained model for subsequent policy
generation. Experiments across 10 CO problems showcase the versatility of
UniCO, emphasizing its ability to generalize to new, unseen problems with
minimal fine-tuning, achieving even few-shot or zero-shot performance. Our
framework offers a valuable complement to existing neural CO methods that focus
on optimizing performance for individual problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市交通流量数据对规划至关重要，但传感器部署成本高且稀疏，需要有效的插值方法。

Method: GNNUI结合掩码算法、节点特征和针对零膨胀分布的损失函数，优化了城市交通流量估计。

Result: GNNUI在多种指标（MAE、RMSE等）上优于现有方法，且在极端稀疏数据下仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: GNNUI为城市交通流量估计提供了高效解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Reliable street-level traffic volume data, covering multiple modes of
transportation, helps urban planning by informing decisions on infrastructure
improvements, traffic management, and public transportation. Yet, traffic
sensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their
high deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods
can estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data.
Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume
forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying
them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks
exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed
with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains
unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph
Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume
estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation,
integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function
tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we
introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering
different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York
City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation
methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence)
and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. On Strava, for instance, MAE
rises only from 7.1 to 10.5, on Taxi from 23.0 to 40.4, demonstrating strong
performance under extreme data scarcity, common in real-world urban settings.
We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成数据的快速增长，传统压缩方法难以应对其复杂性和多样性，需要专门的技术。

Method: 通过14种代表性LLM和8个不同领域的LLM生成数据集，系统研究了基于LLM预测的无损压缩方法。

Result: LLM压缩率超过20倍，显著优于Gzip的3倍，且在不同规模和类型的数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: LLM作为自身输出的压缩器具有高效性和实用性，适用于生成式AI工作负载。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to be deployed and utilized across
domains, the volume of LLM-generated data is growing rapidly. This trend
highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for
such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated
data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or
machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically
derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured
and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This
structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In
contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new
approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored
specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via
next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable
for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as
efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with
14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we
show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates,
exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used
general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different
LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of
LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.

user-specific variability through Variational Edge Feature Extractor. A
Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) enforces adversarial domain generalization,
ensuring robustness to unseen users. Extensive experiments on OPPORTUNITY and
DSADS datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work bridges
biomechanical principles with graph-based adversarial learning by integrating

Conclusion: QiMeng-TensorOp有效释放硬件计算潜力，自动生成高性能张量算子，大幅提升效率并降低成本。

Abstract: Computation-intensive tensor operators constitute over 90\% of the
computations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Neural
Networks.Automatically and efficiently generating high-performance tensor
operators with hardware primitives is crucial for diverse and ever-evolving
hardware architectures like RISC-V, ARM, and GPUs, as manually optimized
implementation takes at least months and lacks portability.LLMs excel at
generating high-level language codes, but they struggle to fully comprehend
hardware characteristics and produce high-performance tensor operators. We
introduce a tensor-operator auto-generation framework with a one-line user
prompt (QiMeng-TensorOp), which enables LLMs to automatically exploit hardware
characteristics to generate tensor operators with hardware primitives, and tune
parameters for optimal performance across diverse hardware. Experimental
results on various hardware platforms, SOTA LLMs, and typical tensor operators
demonstrate that QiMeng-TensorOp effectively unleashes the computing capability
of various hardware platforms, and automatically generates tensor operators of
superior performance. Compared with vanilla LLMs, QiMeng-TensorOp achieves up
to $1291 \times$ performance improvement. Even compared with human experts,
QiMeng-TensorOp could reach $251 \%$ of OpenBLAS on RISC-V CPUs, and $124 \%$

Conclusion: C-LoRAE通过共享知识和任务独立性优化，显著提升了多模态信息提取任务的性能，同时解决了计算和梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) has gained attention for extracting
structured information from multimedia sources. Traditional methods tackle MIE
tasks separately, missing opportunities to share knowledge across tasks. Recent
approaches unify these tasks into a generation problem using instruction-based
T5 models with visual adaptors, optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning.
However, this method is computationally intensive, and multi-task fine-tuning
often faces gradient conflicts, limiting performance. To address these
challenges, we propose collaborative multi-LoRA experts with achievement-based
multi-task loss (C-LoRAE) for MIE tasks. C-LoRAE extends the low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) method by incorporating a universal expert to learn shared
multimodal knowledge from cross-MIE tasks and task-specific experts to learn
specialized instructional task features. This configuration enhances the
model's generalization ability across multiple tasks while maintaining the
independence of various instruction tasks and mitigating gradient conflicts.
Additionally, we propose an achievement-based multi-task loss to balance
training progress across tasks, addressing the imbalance caused by varying
numbers of training samples in MIE tasks. Experimental results on seven
benchmark datasets across three key MIE tasks demonstrate that C-LoRAE achieves
superior overall performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods and
LoRA methods while utilizing a comparable number of training parameters to
LoRA.

Conclusion: GRAPHCOMP通过有效利用时空相关性，显著提升了科学数据的压缩效率。

Abstract: The generation of voluminous scientific data poses significant challenges for
efficient storage, transfer, and analysis. Recently, error-bounded lossy
compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression
ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the
inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing
opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a
novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific
data. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate
a graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations.
Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph
autoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size
of the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses
the process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent
representation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The
decompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error
bound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy
methods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic
data. GRAPHCOMP consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most
datasets, outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to
50%.

Conclusion: 结论是强化学习方法能有效解决图形约束下的资源分配问题，并在复杂环境中表现出适应性。

Abstract: Game-theoretic resource allocation on graphs (GRAG) involves two players
competing over multiple steps to control nodes of interest on a graph, a
problem modeled as a multi-step Colonel Blotto Game (MCBG). Finding optimal
strategies is challenging due to the dynamic action space and structural
constraints imposed by the graph. To address this, we formulate the MCBG as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods,
specifically Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To
enforce graph constraints, we introduce an action-displacement adjacency matrix
that dynamically generates valid action sets at each step. We evaluate RL
performance across a variety of graph structures and initial resource
distributions, comparing against random, greedy, and learned RL policies.
Experimental results show that both DQN and PPO consistently outperform
baseline strategies and converge to a balanced $50\%$ win rate when competing
against the learned RL policy. Particularly, on asymmetric graphs, RL agents
successfully exploit structural advantages and adapt their allocation
strategies, even under disadvantageous initial resource distributions.

Result: MLP模型在多个数据集（Amazon、Twitter、SST）上表现优于基线模型，成本仅为微调基线的1/100。

Conclusion: 新方法有效提升了多情感冲突文本的分类性能，且具有成本优势。

Abstract: Sentiment classification, a complex task in natural language processing,
becomes even more challenging when analyzing passages with multiple conflicting
tones. Typically, longer passages exacerbate this issue, leading to decreased
model performance. The aim of this paper is to introduce novel methodologies
for isolating conflicting sentiments and aggregating them to effectively
predict the overall sentiment of such passages. One of the aggregation
strategies involves a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model which outperforms
baseline models across various datasets, including Amazon, Twitter, and SST
while costing $\sim$1/100 of what fine-tuning the baseline would take.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high
computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning
problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of
LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific
prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility
and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the
reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning
to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the
adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to
perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling
real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance
across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific
prompt design. Code can be found in https://github.com/zch65458525/L2T.

Result: 用户研究表明，人为干预能提升模型性能并保持泛化能力，但也可能引入偏见。

Conclusion: HILL开创了人机交互新范式，结合人类直觉优化模型，同时需警惕干预带来的偏见。

Abstract: Latent space representations are critical for understanding and improving the
behavior of machine learning models, yet they often remain obscure and
intricate. Understanding and exploring the latent space has the potential to
contribute valuable human intuition and expertise about respective domains. In
this work, we present HILL, an interactive framework allowing users to
incorporate human intuition into the model training by interactively reshaping
latent space representations. The modifications are infused into the model
training loop via a novel approach inspired by knowledge distillation, treating
the user's modifications as a teacher to guide the model in reshaping its
intrinsic latent representation. The process allows the model to converge more
effectively and overcome inefficiencies, as well as provide beneficial insights
to the user. We evaluated HILL in a user study tasking participants to train an
optimal model, closely observing the employed strategies. The results
demonstrated that human-guided latent space modifications enhance model
performance while maintaining generalization, yet also revealing the risks of
including user biases. Our work introduces a novel human-AI interaction
paradigm that infuses human intuition into model training and critically
examines the impact of human intervention on training strategies and potential
biases.

Method: 设计了结合电器特征、时间戳、上下文信息及时间序列示例的提示策略，并在REDD数据集上评估。

Result: 优化的提示策略使LLMs在未见过家庭中达到平均F1分数0.676，无需微调即可泛化，并提供可解释的预测。

Conclusion: LLMs能减少数据需求、提升适应性，并为NILM提供透明的能源分解。

Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household
electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more
effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains
limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack
of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning.
We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features,
timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series
examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve
competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on
unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for
fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear,
human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs
can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent
energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Method: 提出Mask-PINNs，使用可学习的非线性掩码函数约束特征分布，同时不违反物理规律。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了特征分布稳定性、准确性和鲁棒性，并支持更宽网络的稳定训练。

Conclusion: Mask-PINNs为PINNs中的内部协变量偏移问题提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
designed to solve partial differential equations by incorporating physical laws
directly into the loss function. However, the internal covariate shift, which
has been largely overlooked, hinders the effective utilization of neural
network capacity in PINNs. To this end, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel
architecture designed to address this issue in PINNs. Unlike traditional
normalization methods such as BatchNorm or LayerNorm, we introduce a learnable,
nonlinear mask function that constrains the feature distributions without
violating underlying physics. The experimental results show that the proposed
method significantly improves feature distribution stability, accuracy, and
robustness across various activation functions and PDE benchmarks. Furthermore,
it enables the stable and efficient training of wider networks a capability
that has been largely overlooked in PINNs.

Abstract: In modern assembly pipelines, identifying anomalies is crucial in ensuring
product quality and operational efficiency. Conventional single-modality
methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise
anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and
multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based
approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce
a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion
techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in
multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion
modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We
evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal
dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our
preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines.
The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses
transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time
series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly
prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对联邦学习（FL）服务器的远程Rowhammer攻击方法，通过操纵客户端传感器观察，利用强化学习（RL）攻击者最大化服务器内存重复更新，导致比特翻转，破坏服务器内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索联邦学习服务器在面对客户端攻击时的脆弱性，尤其是通过远程方式引发Rowhammer攻击的可能性。

Method: 方法包括利用强化学习攻击者操纵客户端传感器观察，诱导服务器高频率重复内存更新，从而实现远程Rowhammer攻击。

Result: 实验表明，攻击者能在目标服务器模型中实现约70%的重复更新率（RUR），成功引发服务器DRAM的比特翻转。

Conclusion: 结论指出这种攻击可能导致学习中断或权限提升，呼吁进一步研究联邦学习的实际缓解策略和硬件设计。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has the potential for simultaneous global learning
amongst a large number of parallel agents, enabling emerging AI such as LLMs to
be trained across demographically diverse data. Central to this being efficient
is the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct
memory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security
focuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication
channels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are
less well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients
offer resilience.
  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency
repetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer
attack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access
to the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to
maximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor
observation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able
to achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve
around 70\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model,
effectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM. The security implications are
that can cause disruptions to learning or may inadvertently cause elevated
privilege. This paves the way for further research on practical mitigation
strategies in FL and hardware design.

Result: CAST成功揭示了治疗效果随时间的变化趋势，帮助临床医生确定最佳治疗时机和受益人群。

Conclusion: CAST为个性化医疗提供了更动态的因果分析工具，适用于头颈鳞癌等严重疾病。

Abstract: Causal machine learning (CML) enables individualized estimation of treatment
effects, offering critical advantages over traditional correlation-based
methods. However, existing approaches for medical survival data with censoring
such as causal survival forests estimate effects at fixed time points, limiting
their ability to capture dynamic changes over time. We introduce Causal
Analysis for Survival Trajectories (CAST), a novel framework that models
treatment effects as continuous functions of time following treatment. By
combining parametric and non-parametric methods, CAST overcomes the limitations
of discrete time-point analysis to estimate continuous effect trajectories.
Using the RADCURE dataset [1] of 2,651 patients with head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a clinically relevant example, CAST models how
chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects evolve over time at the population and
individual levels. By capturing the temporal dynamics of treatment response,
CAST reveals how treatment effects rise, peak, and decline over the follow-up
period, helping clinicians determine when and for whom treatment benefits are
maximized. This framework advances the application of CML to personalized care
in HNSCC and other life-threatening medical conditions. Source code/data

Abstract: As the adoption of Generative AI in real-world services grow explosively,
energy has emerged as a critical bottleneck resource. However, energy remains a
metric that is often overlooked, under-explored, or poorly understood in the
context of building ML systems. We present the ML.ENERGY Benchmark, a benchmark
suite and tool for measuring inference energy consumption under realistic
service environments, and the corresponding ML.ENERGY Leaderboard, which have
served as a valuable resource for those hoping to understand and optimize the
energy consumption of their generative AI services. In this paper, we explain
four key design principles for benchmarking ML energy we have acquired over
time, and then describe how they are implemented in the ML.ENERGY Benchmark. We
then highlight results from the latest iteration of the benchmark, including
energy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different
tasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how
automated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more
than 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model.
The ML.ENERGY Benchmark is open-source and can be easily extended to various
customized models and application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术环境中学生常忽视身体健康，传统机器学习方法因隐私问题难以应用。

Method: 采用预训练MLP模型和联邦学习，通过模型权重共享而非原始数据确保隐私。

Result: RiM模型在联邦平均（FedAvg）下表现优于FedPer，准确率60.71%，平均绝对误差0.91。

Conclusion: RiM在隐私保护下有效预测生活习惯问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In academic settings, the demanding environment often forces students to
prioritize academic performance over their physical well-being. Moreover,
privacy concerns and the inherent risk of data breaches hinder the deployment
of traditional machine learning techniques for addressing these health
challenges. In this study, we introduce RiM: Record, Improve, and Maintain, a
mobile application which incorporates a novel personalized machine learning
framework that leverages federated learning to enhance students' physical
well-being by analyzing their lifestyle habits. Our approach involves
pre-training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model on a large-scale simulated
dataset to generate personalized recommendations. Subsequently, we employ
federated learning to fine-tune the model using data from IISER Bhopal
students, thereby ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. The
federated learning approach guarantees differential privacy by exclusively
sharing model weights rather than raw data. Experimental results show that the
FedAvg-based RiM model achieves an average accuracy of 60.71% and a mean
absolute error of 0.91--outperforming the FedPer variant (average accuracy
46.34%, MAE 1.19)--thereby demonstrating its efficacy in predicting lifestyle
deficits under privacy-preserving constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统主要关注点击率（CTR），但实际业务目标（如视频点播）更注重用户观看时间和收入。

Method: 将问题从分类重新定义为回归，引入Tweedie损失函数，并设计了一个专注于单一目标的损失函数框架。

Result: 离线模拟和在线A/B测试显示，该方法显著提升了用户观看时间和收入。

Conclusion: Tweedie回归是一种高效的解决方案，优于传统的加权Logloss方法。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems aim to increase click-through rates (CTR) for
better user experience, through commonly treating ranking as a classification
task focused on predicting CTR. However, there is a gap between this method and
the actual objectives of businesses across different sectors. In video
recommendation services, the objective of video on demand (VOD) extends beyond
merely encouraging clicks, but also guiding users to discover their true
interests, leading to increased watch time. And longer users watch time will
leads to more revenue through increased chances of presenting online display
advertisements. This research addresses the issue by redefining the problem
from classification to regression, with a focus on maximizing revenue through
user viewing time. Due to the lack of positive labels on recommendation, the
study introduces Tweedie Loss Function, which is better suited in this scenario
than the traditional mean square error loss. The paper also provides insights
on how Tweedie process capture users diverse interests. Our offline simulation
and online A/B test revealed that we can substantially enhance our core
business objectives: user engagement in terms of viewing time and,
consequently, revenue. Additionally, we provide a theoretical comparison
between the Tweedie Loss and the commonly employed viewing time weighted
Logloss, highlighting why Tweedie Regression stands out as an efficient
solution. We further outline a framework for designing a loss function that
focuses on a singular objective.

Result: 证明了结构化弃权问题的有效性，并展示了其在多分类任务中的扩展性。

Conclusion: Lovász hinge在特定条件下一致，结构化弃权问题为结构化分类提供了新的解释性和实用性。

Abstract: The Lov\'asz hinge is a convex loss function proposed for binary structured
classification, in which k related binary predictions jointly evaluated by a
submodular function. Despite its prevalence in image segmentation and related
tasks, the consistency of the Lov\'asz hinge has remained open. We show that
the Lov\'asz hinge is inconsistent with its desired target unless the set
function used for evaluation is modular. Leveraging the embedding framework of
Finocchiaro et al. (2024), we find the target loss for which the Lov\'asz hinge
is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem, is a
variant of selective classification for structured prediction that allows one
to abstain on any subset of the k binary predictions. We derive a family of
link functions, each of which is simultaneously consistent for all
polymatroids, a subset of submodular set functions. We then give sufficient
conditions on the polymatroid for the structured abstain problem to be tightly
embedded by the Lov\'asz hinge, meaning no target prediction is redundant. We
experimentally demonstrate the potential of the structured abstain problem for
interpretability in structured classification tasks. Finally, for the
multiclass setting, we show that one can combine the binary encoding
construction of Ramaswamy et al. (2018) with our link construction to achieve
an efficient consistent surrogate for a natural multiclass generalization of
the structured abstain problem.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that sponge attacks can significantly increase the
energy consumption and inference latency of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, prior work has focused primarily on computer vision and natural
language processing tasks, overlooking the growing use of lightweight AI models
in sensing-based applications on resource-constrained devices, such as those in
Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These attacks pose serious threats of
energy depletion and latency degradation in systems where limited battery
capacity and real-time responsiveness are critical for reliable operation. This
paper makes two key contributions. First, we present the first systematic
exploration of energy-latency sponge attacks targeting sensing-based AI models.
Using wearable sensing-based AI as a case study, we demonstrate that sponge
attacks can substantially degrade performance by increasing energy consumption,
leading to faster battery drain, and by prolonging inference latency. Second,
to mitigate such attacks, we investigate model pruning, a widely adopted
compression technique for resource-constrained AI, as a potential defense. Our
experiments show that pruning-induced sparsity significantly improves model
resilience against sponge poisoning. We also quantify the trade-offs between
model efficiency and attack resilience, offering insights into the security
implications of model compression in sensing-based AI systems deployed in IoT
environments.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain
solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As
PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty
Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties
that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure
to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions
to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error
bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the
uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the
obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in
cosmology.

Abstract: We investigate in-context learning (ICL) through a meticulous experimental
framework that systematically varies task complexity and model architecture.
Extending beyond the linear regression baseline, we introduce Gaussian kernel
regression and nonlinear dynamical system tasks, which emphasize temporal and
recursive reasoning. We evaluate four distinct models: a GPT2-style
Transformer, a Transformer with FlashAttention mechanism, a convolutional
Hyena-based model, and the Mamba state-space model. Each model is trained from
scratch on synthetic datasets and assessed for generalization during testing.
Our findings highlight that model architecture significantly shapes ICL
performance. The standard Transformer demonstrates robust performance across
diverse tasks, while Mamba excels in temporally structured dynamics. Hyena
effectively captures long-range dependencies but shows higher variance early in
training, and FlashAttention offers computational efficiency but is more
sensitive in low-data regimes. Further analysis uncovers locality-induced
shortcuts in Gaussian kernel tasks, enhanced nonlinear separability through
input range scaling, and the critical role of curriculum learning in mastering
high-dimensional tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs)
presents significant challenges due to their high memory demands. These
challenges become even more pronounced in multi-tenant environments, where
shared resources must accommodate multiple models, limiting the effectiveness
of conventional virtualization techniques. This paper addresses the problem of
efficiently serving multiple fine-tuned MoE-LLMs on a single-GPU. We propose a
serving system that employs \textit{similarity-based expert consolidation} to
reduce the overall memory footprint by sharing similar experts across models.
To ensure output quality, we introduce \textit{runtime partial
reconfiguration}, dynamically replacing non-expert layers when processing
requests from different models. As a result, our approach achieves a
competitive output quality while maintaining throughput comparable to serving a
single model while incurring a negligible increase in time-to-first-token
(TTFT). Experiments on a server with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (80GB) using
Mixtral-8x7B models demonstrate an 85\% average reduction in turnaround time
compared to NVIDIA's multi-instance GPU (MIG). Furthermore, experiments on
Google's Switch Transformer Base-8 model with up to four variants demonstrate
the scalability and resilience of our approach in maintaining output quality
compared to other model merging baselines, highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization in static
datasets, avoiding the risks and costs of real-world exploration. However, it
struggles with suboptimal behavior learning and inaccurate value estimation due
to the lack of environmental interaction. In this paper, we present
Video-Enhanced Offline RL (VeoRL), a model-based approach that constructs an
interactive world model from diverse, unlabeled video data readily available

knowledge of control policy and physical dynamics from natural videos to the RL
agent within the target domain. Our method achieves substantial performance

manipulation, autonomous driving, and open-world video games.

Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in terms of
efficiency and accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous environments where
clients employ diverse model architectures and have varying computational
resources. Such heterogeneity complicates the aggregation process, leading to
performance bottlenecks and reduced model generalizability. To address these
issues, we propose FedADP, a federated learning framework designed to adapt to
client heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting model architectures during
aggregation. FedADP enables effective collaboration among clients with
differing capabilities, maximizing resource utilization and ensuring model
quality. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedADP significantly
outperforms existing methods, such as FlexiFed, achieving an accuracy
improvement of up to 23.30%, thereby enhancing model adaptability and training
efficiency in heterogeneous real-world settings.

Abstract: We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to
optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with
embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the
relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and
the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key
parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how
these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP
analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the
optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient
exploration of the design space.
  The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct
hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those
obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were
achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by
uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward
promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness
of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the
efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under
strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials
and engineering optimization problems.

Result: 在多类别数据集上验证了方法的有效性，保持了模型性能，并在效率和内存消耗上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据遗忘提供了一种高效、可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a speciffc part of the
training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application
scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been
promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve
training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and
challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's
perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel
unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original
neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to
delete. Speciffcally, inspired by the research line of neural network repair,
we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a
given data point with certiffable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a
considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to
iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn,
which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on
multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness,
achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and
being competitive in efffciency and memory consumption compared to various
baseline methods.

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，AUROC达0.96，AUPRC达0.95，并通过案例研究验证了预测结果。

Conclusion: GBDTSVM是一种高效的工具，有望推动snoRNA相关疾病研究的进展。

Abstract: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are increasingly recognized for their critical
role in the pathogenesis and characterization of various human diseases.
Consequently, the precise identification of snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs)
is essential for the progression of diseases and the advancement of treatment
strategies. However, conventional biological experimental approaches are
costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive; therefore, machine
learning-based computational methods offer a promising solution to mitigate
these limitations. This paper proposes a model called 'GBDTSVM', representing a
novel and efficient machine learning approach for predicting snoRNA-disease
associations by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Support
Vector Machine (SVM). 'GBDTSVM' effectively extracts integrated snoRNA-disease
feature representations utilizing GBDT and SVM is subsequently utilized to
classify and identify potential associations. Furthermore, the method enhances
the accuracy of these predictions by incorporating Gaussian kernel profile
similarity for both snoRNAs and diseases. Experimental evaluation of the
GBDTSVM model demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods in the field, achieving an area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC) of 0.96 and an area under the precision-recall curve
(AUPRC) of 0.95 on MDRF dataset. Moreover, our model shows superior performance
on two more datasets named LSGT and PsnoD. Additionally, a case study on the
predicted snoRNA-disease associations verified the top 10 predicted snoRNAs
across nine prevalent diseases, further validating the efficacy of the GBDTSVM
approach. These results underscore the model's potential as a robust tool for
advancing snoRNA-related disease research. Source codes and datasets our
proposed framework can be obtained from: https://github.com/mariamuna04/gbdtsvm

Motivation: 现有因果发现算法（如FCI）在潜在混杂和样本量不足时依赖经验忠实性假设，实际中常因数据限制而失效。

Method: 提出非参数评分方法评估PAG兼容性，并开发dcFCI算法，结合评分与FCI搜索，系统探索和验证候选PAG。

Result: dcFCI在合成和真实数据中显著优于现有方法，能在小样本和异构数据中恢复真实PAG。

Conclusion: dcFCI为因果推理提供了更稳健的工具，支持对结构不确定性的深入分析。

Abstract: Causal discovery is central to inferring causal relationships from
observational data. In the presence of latent confounding, algorithms such as
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) learn a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing
the true model's Markov Equivalence Class. However, their correctness
critically depends on empirical faithfulness, the assumption that observed
(in)dependencies perfectly reflect those of the underlying causal model, which
often fails in practice due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we
introduce the first nonparametric score to assess a PAG's compatibility with
observed data, even with mixed variable types. This score is both necessary and
sufficient to characterize structural uncertainty and distinguish between
distinct PAGs. We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid
causal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical
unfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an
(Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates
candidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate
that dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering
the true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked
PAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting
more robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.

Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches
for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder}
framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems
in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach
that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by
projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and
mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings.
We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments,
including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear
inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is
likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction
metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In
addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables
latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical
experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial
guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds
the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine
variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits
while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.

Abstract: When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the
regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an
under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase
transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in
NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework
for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape
with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature
change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and
that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by
regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional
phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again
identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying
the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the
curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside
the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing
model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking
geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our
work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially
new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the
L2 context.

Motivation: 儿童性虐待图像的传播问题日益严重，执法机构面临繁重的手动分类负担，但直接使用敏感数据存在泄露风险。

Method: 通过定义“代理任务”（即不使用真实CSAI数据的替代任务），结合执法机构的反馈，设计自动化分类模型。

Result: 在真实CSAI数据集上测试的Few-shot室内场景分类模型取得了有希望的结果，且未直接使用敏感数据训练。

Conclusion: 代理任务方法为CSAI自动化分类提供了可行路径，同时避免了数据泄露风险。

Abstract: The distribution of child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) is an ever-growing
concern of our modern world; children who suffered from this heinous crime are
revictimized, and the growing amount of illegal imagery distributed overwhelms
law enforcement agents (LEAs) with the manual labor of categorization. To ease
this burden researchers have explored methods for automating data triage and
detection of CSAI, but the sensitive nature of the data imposes restricted
access and minimal interaction between real data and learning algorithms,
avoiding leaks at all costs. In observing how these restrictions have shaped
the literature we formalize a definition of "Proxy Tasks", i.e., the substitute
tasks used for training models for CSAI without making use of CSA data. Under
this new terminology we review current literature and present a protocol for
making conscious use of Proxy Tasks together with consistent input from LEAs to
design better automation in this field. Finally, we apply this protocol to
study -- for the first time -- the task of Few-shot Indoor Scene Classification
on CSAI, showing a final model that achieves promising results on a real-world
CSAI dataset whilst having no weights actually trained on sensitive data.

Conclusion: Dyn-D$^2$P首次实现了动态梯度裁剪和噪声水平的差分隐私去中心化非凸优化，提升了精度和隐私保护。

Abstract: Most existing decentralized learning methods with differential privacy (DP)
guarantee rely on constant gradient clipping bounds and fixed-level DP Gaussian
noises for each node throughout the training process, leading to a significant
accuracy degradation compared to non-private counterparts. In this paper, we
propose a new Dynamic Differentially Private Decentralized learning approach
(termed Dyn-D$^2$P) tailored for general time-varying directed networks.
Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P
dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient
convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model
accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its
counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy
guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P
that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a
scaling factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias
error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first
model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex
optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.

Conclusion: BOF4和OPQ方法有效优化了块级量化，提升了内存效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand extensive memory capacity during both
fine-tuning and inference. To enable memory-efficient fine-tuning, existing
methods apply block-wise quantization techniques, such as NF4 and AF4, to the
network weights. We show that these quantization techniques incur suboptimal
quantization errors. Therefore, as a first novelty, we propose an optimization
approach for block-wise quantization. Using this method, we design a family of
quantizers named 4-bit block-wise optimal float (BOF4), which consistently
reduces the quantization error compared to both baseline methods. We provide
both a theoretical and a data-driven solution for the optimization process and
prove their practical equivalence. Secondly, we propose a modification to the
employed normalization method based on the signed absolute block maximum
(BOF4-S), enabling further reduction of the quantization error and empirically
achieving less degradation in language modeling performance. Thirdly, we
explore additional variations of block-wise quantization methods applied to
LLMs through an experimental study on the importance of accurately representing
zero and large-amplitude weights on the one hand, and optimization towards
various error metrics on the other hand. Lastly, we introduce a mixed-precision
quantization strategy dubbed outlier-preserving quantization (OPQ) to address
the distributional mismatch induced by outlier weights in block-wise
quantization. By storing outlier weights in 16-bit precision (OPQ) while
applying BOF4-S, we achieve top performance among 4-bit block-wise quantization
techniques w.r.t. perplexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型自适应特征提取时频网络（AFE-TFNet），用于提高显著波高（Hs）预测的准确性和稳定性，解决了数据泄漏问题，并在实验中显著优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著波高（Hs）的非线性和非平稳特性使其预测具有挑战性，传统分解预处理方法可能导致数据泄漏，因此需要一种既能提取特征又能避免泄漏的新方法。

Method: AFE-TFNet采用编码器-解码器滚动框架，编码器通过小波变换和傅里叶变换提取全局和局部频域特征，并通过主导谐波序列能量加权（DHSEW）融合时域和频域特征；解码器使用LSTM模型。

Result: 实验表明，AFE-TFNet在预测准确性上显著优于基准方法，特征提取和DHSEW显著提升了中长期的预测精度，且预测性能对滚动时间窗口大小的变化不敏感。

Conclusion: AFE-TFNet在处理复杂信号预测方面表现出强大潜力，尤其是在避免数据泄漏和提高预测稳定性方面。

Abstract: Precise forecasting of significant wave height (Hs) is essential for the
development and utilization of wave energy. The challenges in predicting Hs
arise from its non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. The combination
of decomposition preprocessing and machine learning models have demonstrated
significant effectiveness in Hs prediction by extracting data features.
However, decomposing the unknown data in the test set can lead to data leakage
issues. To simultaneously achieve data feature extraction and prevent data
leakage, a novel Adaptive Feature Extraction Time-Frequency Network (AFE-TFNet)
is proposed to improve prediction accuracy and stability. It is encoder-decoder
rolling framework. The encoder consists of two stages: feature extraction and
feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, global and local frequency
domain features are extracted by combining Wavelet Transform (WT) and Fourier
Transform (FT), and multi-scale frequency analysis is performed using Inception
blocks. In the feature fusion stage, time-domain and frequency-domain features
are integrated through dominant harmonic sequence energy weighting (DHSEW). The
decoder employed an advanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Hourly
measured wind speed (Ws), dominant wave period (DPD), average wave period (APD)
and Hs from three stations are used as the dataset, and the four metrics are
employed to evaluate the forecasting performance. Results show that AFE-TFNet
significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of prediction accuracy.
Feature extraction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. DHSEW has
substantially increased the accuracy of medium-term to long-term forecasting.
The prediction accuracy of AFE-TFNet does not demonstrate significant
variability with changes of rolling time window size. Overall, AFE-TFNet shows
strong potential for handling complex signal forecasting.

sine bases to extract wave features from the frequency domain while preserving
temporal information. Additionally, we introduce the Exogenous-to-Endogenous
Cross-Attention (E2ECA) module, which employs cross attention to model the
interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables. We incorporate a
Temporal-wise Attention (TA) mechanism that adaptively captures complex
dependencies in endogenous variables. These integrated modules function
synergistically, enabling E2E-FANet to achieve both comprehensive feature
perception in the time-frequency domain and precise modeling of wave-structure
interactions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of E2E-FANet, we
constructed a multi-level validation framework comprising three distinct
testing scenarios: internal validation under identical wave conditions,
generalization testing across different wave conditions, and adaptability
testing with varying relative water density (RW) conditions. These
comprehensive tests demonstrate that E2E-FANet provides accurate waves behind
FB predictions while successfully generalizing diverse wave conditions.

*Xiyuan Wei,Ming Lin,Fanjiang Ye,Fengguang Song,Liangliang Cao,My T. That,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“模型引导”的学习范式，通过参考模型指导目标模型的训练，并提出了理论驱动的DRRho风险最小化框架，提升了泛化能力和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在模型引导中缺乏理论基础，导致性能不佳，本文旨在填补这一空白并提供理论支持。

Method: 提出了基于分布鲁棒优化（DRO）的DRRho风险最小化框架，并将其应用于对比学习（CLIP）中，形成DRRho-CLIP方法。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，DRRho-CLIP在泛化能力和数据效率上优于无参考模型的方法，并展现出更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文为模型引导提供了首个理论框架，并通过DRRho-CLIP展示了其实际优势，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

### [178] [Beyond $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Constraint Violation for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06709)
*Abhishek Sinha,Rahul Vaze*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the Online Convex Optimization problem with adversarial
constraints (COCO) where, in each round, a learner is presented with a convex
cost function and a convex constraint function, both of which may be chosen
adversarially. The learner selects actions from a convex decision set in an
online fashion, with the goal of minimizing both regret and the cumulative
constraint violation (CCV) over a horizon of $T$ rounds. The best-known policy
for this problem achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV.
In this paper, we present a surprising improvement that achieves a
significantly smaller CCV by trading it off with regret. Specifically, for any
bounded convex cost and constraint functions, we propose an online policy that
achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT}+ T^\beta)$ regret and $\tilde{O}(dT^{1-\beta})$
CCV, where $d$ is the dimension of the decision set and $\beta \in [0,1]$ is a
tunable parameter. We achieve this result by first considering the special case
of $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem where the decision set is a
probability simplex and the cost and constraint functions are linear.
Leveraging a new adaptive small-loss regret bound, we propose an efficient
policy for the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, that attains
$O(\sqrt{T\ln N}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta} \ln N)$ CCV,
where $N$ is the number of experts. The original problem is then reduced to the
$\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem via a covering argument. Finally, with an
additional smoothness assumption, we propose an efficient gradient-based policy
attaining $O(T^{\max(\frac{1}{2},\beta)})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta})$
CCV.

*Debashish Saha,Piyush Malik,Adrika Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级LSTM模型，用于同时分类活动和执行者，并处理传感器数据缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注活动分类，而忽略了执行者识别和数据缺失问题，这对个性化应用至关重要。

Method: 使用LSTM模型分类活动和执行者，并模拟数据缺失场景，结合KNN插补技术处理缺失数据。

Result: 活动识别准确率93.89%（接近基准96.67%），执行者识别准确率80.19%；KNN插补在不使用PCA时效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该框架在活动和执行者分类及处理数据缺失方面表现优异，为HAR研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Current studies in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily focus on the
classification of activities through sensor data, while there is not much
emphasis placed on recognizing the individuals performing these activities.
This type of classification is very important for developing personalized and
context-sensitive applications. Additionally, the issue of missing sensor data,
which often occurs in practical situations due to hardware malfunctions, has
not been explored yet. This paper seeks to fill these voids by introducing a
lightweight LSTM-based model that can be used to classify both activities and
subjects. The proposed model was used to classify the HAR dataset by UCI [1],
achieving an accuracy of 93.89% in activity recognition (across six
activities), nearing the 96.67% benchmark, and an accuracy of 80.19% in subject
recognition (involving 30 subjects), thereby establishing a new baseline for
this area of research. We then simulate the absence of sensor data to mirror
real-world scenarios and incorporate imputation techniques, both with and
without Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to restore incomplete datasets. We
found that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation performs the best for filling
the missing sensor data without PCA because the use of PCA resulted in slightly
lower accuracy. These results demonstrate how well the framework handles
missing sensor data, which is a major step forward in using the Human Activity
Recognition dataset for reliable classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在良性数据集上进行微调，也可能导致大语言模型（LLM）输出的有害性显著增加。通过分析并选择数据集中最影响安全性的样本进行微调，提出了一种更有效的攻击方法Self-Inf-N。实验表明，该方法对主流LLM具有高迁移性，且现有防御策略难以应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示微调阶段LLM的安全脆弱性，并提出一种更有效的攻击方法以验证其威胁。

Method: 从异常检测角度出发，提出Self-Inf-N方法，识别并提取良性数据集中的异常样本用于微调。

Result: 实验表明，仅用100个异常样本微调即可严重破坏LLM的安全对齐，且攻击对多种架构的LLM均有效。

Conclusion: 现有防御策略难以抵御此类攻击，亟需更鲁棒的安全对齐机制。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a troubling vulnerability in the fine-tuning
stage of large language models (LLMs): even fine-tuning on entirely benign
datasets can lead to a significant increase in the harmfulness of LLM outputs.
Building on this finding, our red teaming study takes this threat one step
further by developing a more effective attack. Specifically, we analyze and
identify samples within benign datasets that contribute most to safety
degradation, then fine-tune LLMs exclusively on these samples. We approach this
problem from an outlier detection perspective and propose Self-Inf-N, to detect
and extract outliers for fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning LLMs
on 100 outlier samples selected by Self-Inf-N in the benign datasets severely
compromises LLM safety alignment. Extensive experiments across seven mainstream
LLMs demonstrate that our attack exhibits high transferability across different
architectures and remains effective in practical scenarios. Alarmingly, our
results indicate that most existing mitigation strategies fail to defend
against this attack, underscoring the urgent need for more robust alignment
safeguards. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的黑盒特性在关键领域（如医学图像分析）中是一个显著限制，现有可解释性方法存在计算开销大和结果不一致的问题。

Method: 提出DxANN架构，基于流式框架，直接在训练过程中生成逐样本、逐特征的解释，适用于图像任务。

Result: DxANN能够同时实现准确预测和透明决策，尤其适合医学图像分析，并可扩展到其他数据类型。

Conclusion: DxANN为深度学习提供了内在可解释性，适用于需要信任和问责的应用场景。

Abstract: While deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous
domains, their black-box nature remains a significant limitation, especially in
critical fields such as medical image analysis and inference. Existing
explainability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, are typically applied
post hoc, adding computational overhead and sometimes producing inconsistent or
ambiguous results. In this paper, we present the Deeply Explainable Artificial
Neural Network (DxANN), a novel deep learning architecture that embeds
explainability ante hoc, directly into the training process. Unlike
conventional models that require external interpretation methods, DxANN is
designed to produce per-sample, per-feature explanations as part of the forward
pass. Built on a flow-based framework, it enables both accurate predictions and
transparent decision-making, and is particularly well-suited for image-based
tasks. While our focus is on medical imaging, the DxANN architecture is readily
adaptable to other data modalities, including tabular and sequential data.
DxANN marks a step forward toward intrinsically interpretable deep learning,
offering a practical solution for applications where trust and accountability
are essential.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LineFlow，一个用于模拟任意复杂度生产线并训练强化学习（RL）代理控制它们的开源Python框架。通过数学分析验证其理论假设，并展示了RL在已知场景中接近最优性能，但在复杂工业规模生产线中仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产线的主动控制机制（如自适应路由、工人重新分配和重新调度）设计复杂，缺乏标准化框架，RL虽具潜力但尚未解决所有问题。

Method: 提出LineFlow框架，模拟生产线并训练RL代理，通过数学分析验证其理论假设，并提供最优解作为基准。

Result: RL在已知场景中接近最优性能，但在复杂工业规模生产线中表现不佳，需进一步研究奖励设计、课程学习和分层控制。

Conclusion: LineFlow为生产线控制提供了标准化框架，但RL在复杂场景中仍需改进，未来研究方向包括奖励设计等。

Abstract: Many production lines require active control mechanisms, such as adaptive
routing, worker reallocation, and rescheduling, to maintain optimal
performance. However, designing these control systems is challenging for
various reasons, and while reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in
addressing these challenges, a standardized and general framework is still
lacking. In this work, we introduce LineFlow, an extensible, open-source Python
framework for simulating production lines of arbitrary complexity and training
RL agents to control them. To demonstrate the capabilities and to validate the
underlying theoretical assumptions of LineFlow, we formulate core subproblems
of active line control in ways that facilitate mathematical analysis. For each
problem, we provide optimal solutions for comparison. We benchmark
state-of-the-art RL algorithms and show that the learned policies approach
optimal performance in well-understood scenarios. However, for more complex,
industrial-scale production lines, RL still faces significant challenges,
highlighting the need for further research in areas such as reward shaping,
curriculum learning, and hierarchical control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受统计力学中玻尔兹曼分布的启发，旨在为机器学习提供一种基于能量的、可解释的分类方法。

Method: 利用特征偏差计算能量函数，生成与玻尔兹曼分布类似的类别概率，并通过KT变量调节高能态概率。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率与逻辑回归和K近邻相当，同时计算高效且无需迭代优化。

Conclusion: 玻尔兹曼分类器展示了物理学思想如何推动机器学习发展，为基于能量的决策系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification algorithm, the Boltzmann Classifier,
inspired by the thermodynamic principles underlying the Boltzmann distribution.
Our method computes a probabilistic estimate for each class based on an energy
function derived from feature-wise deviations between input samples and
class-specific centroids. The resulting probabilities are proportional to the
exponential negative energies, normalized across classes, analogous to the
Boltzmann distribution used in statistical mechanics. In addition, the KT
variable can be used to allow the high energy states to be more accessible,
which allows the tuning of their probabilities as needed. We evaluate the model
performance on several datasets from different applications. The model achieves
a high accuracy, which indicates that the Boltzmann Classifier is competitive
with standard models like logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors while
offering a thermodynamically motivated probabilistic interpretation. our
classifier does not require iterative optimization or backpropagation and is
thus computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing workflows.
This work demonstrates how ideas from physics can inform new directions in
machine learning, providing a foundation for interpretable, energy-based
decision-making systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码计算技术通常仅适用于精确计算和特定函数类，限制了其在联邦学习中的广泛应用。本文旨在通过PBACC提供一种通用且强隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 提出了基于PBACC的算法，分别针对集中式聚合、集中式数据的分布式训练和分散式数据的分散式训练场景。

Result: 实验表明，PBACC对多种模型（如卷积神经网络、变分自编码器和Cox回归）的性能影响极小，隐私泄露可严格限制在每位参与者少于1比特。

Conclusion: PBACC是一种高效的隐私保护工具，适用于多种联邦学习场景，且计算成本仅取决于数据的分散程度。

Abstract: Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy
protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for
coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved
are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require
quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate
Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect
privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for
centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and
secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging
significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy
protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used
robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a
variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of
different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational
autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new
computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less
than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational
cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of
decentralization of the data.

Motivation: 研究DNN的泛化能力，揭示其训练过程中交互模式的动态变化，以理解泛化差距的成因。

Method: 基于可解释AI的理论成果，将DNN的推理逻辑严格重写为少量AND-OR交互模式，并提出量化交互泛化能力的方法。

Result: 发现交互泛化能力在训练过程中呈现三阶段动态：早期去除噪声和非泛化交互，中后期学习复杂但难泛化的交互。实验验证非泛化交互是训练与测试损失差距的直接原因。

Conclusion: 通过分析交互动态，揭示了DNN泛化能力的关键机制，为理解和改进DNN泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new perspective for analyzing the generalization power
of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., directly disentangling and analyzing the
dynamics of generalizable and non-generalizable interaction encoded by a DNN
through the training process. Specifically, this work builds upon the recent
theoretical achievement in explainble AI, which proves that the detailed
inference logic of DNNs can be can be strictly rewritten as a small number of
AND-OR interaction patterns. Based on this, we propose an efficient method to
quantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a
distinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions
during training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes
noisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable
ones. The second and the third phases tend to capture increasingly complex
interactions that are harder to generalize. Experimental results verify that
the learning of non-generalizable interactions is the the direct cause for the
gap between the training and testing losses.

Result: LGR-AD在多个基准测试中优于传统扩散模型，展示了其在复杂图像生成任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: LGR-AD为动态计算机视觉任务提供了可扩展且灵活的解决方案，未来可进一步探索其应用范围。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image
synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot
generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual
prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual
fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might
not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD
(Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system
designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD
models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents,
each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to
varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes
their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a
coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the
generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that
minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical
analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms
traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its
potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation
tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/YousIA/LGR_AD

Abstract: This paper quantitatively investigates the crash severity of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) with spatially localized machine learning and macroscopic
measures of the urban built environment. We address spatial heterogeneity and
spatial autocorrelation, while focusing on land use patterns and human
behavior. Our Geographical Random Forest (GRF) model, accompanied with a crash
severity risk map of San Francisco, presents three findings that are useful for
commercial operations of AVs and robotaxis. First, spatially localized machine
learning performed better than regular machine learning, when predicting AV
crash severity. Bias-variance tradeoff was evident as we adjust the
localization weight hyperparameter. Second, land use was the most important
built environment measure, compared to intersections, building footprints,
public transit stops, and Points Of Interests (POIs). Third, it was predicted
that city center areas with greater diversity and commercial activities were
more likely to result in low-severity AV crashes, than residential
neighborhoods. Residential land use may be associated with higher severity due
to human behavior and less restrictive environment. This paper recommends to
explicitly consider geographic locations, and to design safety measures
specific to residential neighborhoods, when robotaxi operators train their AV
systems.

Conclusion: RSAE在多时间尺度预测和市场驱动因素解释方面优于传统黑盒方法。

Abstract: Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating
accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like
copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors
(macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack
transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse
Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon
commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market
drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week,
1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization
($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity,
promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors
representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from
energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy
while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude
Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers
competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into
price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over
traditional black-box approaches.

Abstract: For domains that involve numerical simulation, it can be computationally
expensive to run an ensemble of simulations spanning a parameter space of
interest to a user. To this end, an attractive surrogate for simulation is the
generative modeling of fields produced by an ensemble, allowing one to
synthesize fields in a computationally cheap, yet accurate, manner. However,
for the purposes of visual analysis, a limitation of generative models is their
lack of control, as it is unclear what one should expect when sampling a field
from a model. In this paper we study how to make generative models of fields
more controllable, so that users can specify features of interest, in
particular topological features, that they wish to see in the output. We
propose topology guidance, a method for guiding the sampling process of a
generative model, specifically a diffusion model, such that a topological
description specified as input is satisfied in the generated output. Central to
our method, we couple a coordinate-based neural network used to represent
fields, with a diffusion model used for generation. We show how to use
topologically-relevant signals provided by the coordinate-based network to help
guide the denoising process of a diffusion model. This enables us to faithfully
represent a user's specified topology, while ensuring that the output field
remains within the generative data distribution. Specifically, we study 2D
vector field topology, evaluating our method over an ensemble of fluid flows,
where we show that generated vector fields faithfully adhere to the location,
and type, of critical points over the spatial domain. We further show the
benefits of our method in aiding the comparison of ensembles, allowing one to
explore commonalities and differences in distributions along prescribed
topological features.

Abstract: Illegal parking along with the lack of available parking spaces are among the
biggest issues faced in many large cities. These issues can have a significant
impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been
designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available
for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for
people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by
illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of
parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting
the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these
implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an
indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level,
equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate
information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based
model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking
systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for
further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and
noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in
Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate
parking violation predictions.

Result: Stream-SW在比较高斯分布和高斯混合分布时，比随机子采样更准确且内存消耗更低。实验验证了其在点云分类、点云梯度流和流式变化点检测中的优越性能。

Conclusion: Stream-SW是一种高效且内存友好的方法，适用于流式数据场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sliced optimal transport (SOT) or sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance is widely
recognized for its statistical and computational scalability. In this work, we
further enhance the computational scalability by proposing the first method for
computing SW from sample streams, called \emph{streaming sliced Wasserstein}
(Stream-SW). To define Stream-SW, we first introduce the streaming computation
of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. Since the one-dimensional
Wasserstein (1DW) distance has a closed-form expression, given by the absolute
difference between the quantile functions of the compared distributions, we
leverage quantile approximation techniques for sample streams to define the
streaming 1DW distance. By applying streaming 1DW to all projections, we obtain
Stream-SW. The key advantage of Stream-SW is its low memory complexity while
providing theoretical guarantees on the approximation error. We demonstrate
that Stream-SW achieves a more accurate approximation of SW than random
subsampling, with lower memory consumption, in comparing Gaussian distributions
and mixtures of Gaussians from streaming samples. Additionally, we conduct
experiments on point cloud classification, point cloud gradient flows, and
streaming change point detection to further highlight the favorable performance
of Stream-SW.

TL;DR: 研究了混合专家层（MoE）中活跃专家数量（粒度）对模型表达能力的影响，发现高粒度（如每层8个专家）比低粒度（如每层1个专家）具有指数级的表达能力优势。


<details>

Motivation: 探索MoE层中活跃专家数量对模型性能的影响，以优化计算成本与参数规模之间的平衡。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较不同粒度（如8个专家与1个专家）的MoE架构。

Result: 高粒度MoE架构在表达能力上具有指数级优势，实验数据支持这一理论发现。

Conclusion: 模型设计应倾向于更高粒度的MoE架构，以提升表达能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are increasingly central to frontier model
architectures. By selectively activating parameters, they reduce computational
cost while scaling total parameter count. This paper investigates the impact of
the number of active experts, termed granularity, comparing architectures with
many (e.g., 8 per layer in DeepSeek) to those with fewer (e.g., 1 per layer in
Llama-4 models). We prove an exponential separation in network expressivity
based on this design parameter, suggesting that models benefit from higher
granularity. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and
illustrate this separation.

Method: 引入Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO)，直接估计偏好与非偏好输出的密度比，避免显式建模人类偏好。

Result: 理论证明DDRO具有统计一致性，实验显示其在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DDRO为真正数据驱动的对齐提供了潜力，推动了更可靠、更符合人类偏好的LLMs发展。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for
safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like
Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where
more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address
this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio
Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between
preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for
explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is
statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred
distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference
structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance
compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the
potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and
human-aligned LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过核平滑机制结合两种模型的优势，能够更好地处理非均匀平滑度问题，同时提升预测性能和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due
to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness
of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical
problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of
smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression
partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable
support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at
the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor
performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of
both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random
forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate
empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive
performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases,
also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on
inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of
the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact
tree-splitting locations.

TL;DR: FreqMoE是一种高效的训练框架，通过利用高频信号对低频分量的依赖性，解决了FNO在高维输入和长期预测中的性能问题，显著提升了准确性和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNO在解决PDE时，高频信号的稀疏性和固定模式截断会导致性能下降，尤其是在高分辨率输入或长期预测场景中。

Method: FreqMoE采用渐进式训练框架，先学习低频权重，再通过稀疏向上循环策略在频域构建专家混合模型，将权重扩展到高频区域。

Result: 实验表明，FreqMoE在准确率上提升了16.6%，同时参数减少了47.32倍，且在长期预测中表现稳定。

Conclusion: FreqMoE为PDE求解建立了“低频预训练，高频微调”的新范式，适用于多种FNO变体和网格结构。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) have emerged as promising solutions for
efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning
infinite-dimensional function mappings through frequency domain
transformations. However, the sparsity of high-frequency signals limits
computational efficiency for high-dimensional inputs, and fixed-pattern
truncation often causes high-frequency signal loss, reducing performance in
scenarios such as high-resolution inputs or long-term predictions. To address
these challenges, we propose FreqMoE, an efficient and progressive training
framework that exploits the dependency of high-frequency signals on
low-frequency components. The model first learns low-frequency weights and then
applies a sparse upward-cycling strategy to construct a mixture of experts
(MoE) in the frequency domain, effectively extending the learned weights to
high-frequency regions. Experiments on both regular and irregular grid PDEs
demonstrate that FreqMoE achieves up to 16.6% accuracy improvement while using
merely 2.1% parameters (47.32x reduction) compared to dense FNO. Furthermore,
the approach demonstrates remarkable stability in long-term predictions and
generalizes seamlessly to various FNO variants and grid structures,
establishing a new ``Low frequency Pretraining, High frequency Fine-tuning''
paradigm for solving PDEs.

Abstract: To further utilize the unsupervised features and pairwise information, we
propose a general Bilevel Clustering Optimization (BCO) framework to improve
the performance of clustering. And then we introduce three special cases on
subspace clustering with two different types of masks. At first, we reformulate
the original subspace clustering as a Basic Masked Subspace Clustering (BMSC),
which reformulate the diagonal constraints to a hard mask. Then, we provide a
General Masked Subspace Clustering (GMSC) method to integrate different
clustering via a soft mask. Furthermore, based on BCO and GMSC, we induce a
learnable soft mask and design a Recursive Masked Subspace Clustering (RMSC)
method that can alternately update the affinity matrix and the soft mask.
Numerical experiments show that our models obtain significant improvement
compared with the baselines on several commonly used datasets, such as MNIST,
USPS, ORL, COIL20 and COIL100.

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了线性和非线性模型的优势，提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the
de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical
meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear
technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in
economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial
classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships
and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price
pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that
inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the
com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on
multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance
is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency.
Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently
outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with
a modest increase in execution time.

Conclusion: SoftShape通过软稀疏化和学习机制，高效且可解释地提升了时间序列分类性能。

Abstract: Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high
interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive
nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on
selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate
subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial
shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification
performance. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Soft} sparse \textbf{Shape}s
(\textbf{SoftShape}) model for efficient time series classification. Our
approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning
blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on
classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single
shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter
facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model
efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a
learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for
intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns
inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive
experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and
produces interpretable results.

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering
hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of
multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated
Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and
quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy
protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL,
often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In
this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness
in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client
models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities.
Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection
under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to
dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio
Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently
outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and
personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities,

Abstract: Time series forecasting has important applications in financial analysis,
weather forecasting, and traffic management. However, existing deep learning
models are limited in processing non-stationary time series data because they
cannot effectively capture the statistical characteristics that change over
time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new framework, AEFIN,
which enhances the information sharing ability between stable and unstable
components by introducing a cross-attention mechanism, and combines Fourier
analysis networks with MLP to deeply explore the seasonal patterns and trend
characteristics in unstable components. In addition, we design a new loss
function that combines time-domain stability constraints, time-domain
instability constraints, and frequency-domain stability constraints to improve
the accuracy and robustness of forecasting. Experimental results show that
AEFIN outperforms the most common models in terms of mean square error and mean
absolute error, especially under non-stationary data conditions, and shows
excellent forecasting capabilities. This paper provides an innovative solution
for the modeling and forecasting of non-stationary time series data, and
contributes to the research of deep learning for complex time series.

Abstract: Inverse electromagnetic modeling has emerged as a powerful approach for
designing complex microwave structures with high accuracy and efficiency. In
this study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for
the inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components
based on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to
demonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.
Therefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart
filter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual
neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design
techniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved
generalization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to
generate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy
inspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network
(HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate
that the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy
compared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical
metrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate
the proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW
structure. Next, we apply the trained IRC-Net model to predict the geometry of
a four-resonance structure based on its desired frequency response. Both
designs are fabricated and tested, showing strong agreement between the
simulated, predicted, and measured results, confirming the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 随着C-V2X向6G网络发展，CAV成为关键应用，但决策过程在不确定环境下仍面临挑战。VoI作为车辆控制与V2X通信的桥梁，亟需系统化建模。

Method: 引入SSDP模型定义和评估VoI，证明MDP是其特例，并提出基于MDP、RL和最优控制理论的VoI建模框架，分类VoI并讨论其估计方法。

Result: SSDP模型能显式表示增强决策的信息集，并通过VoI相关奖励函数优化通信系统的“何时”、“什么”和“如何”通信问题。

Conclusion: SSDP模型和VoI框架为网络化控制系统中随机、顺序的控制与通信决策联合优化提供了潜力。

Abstract: As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are
emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning
(ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to
significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X
communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are
closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial
bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision
Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application
in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define
the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The
SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of
information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as
current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI
modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal
Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their
corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to
leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and
``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated
with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization
objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to
illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to
facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and
communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

Result: GuidedQuant在多种量化场景下均提升了性能，且新算法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GuidedQuant通过优化量化目标和保持权重依赖，显著提升了量化效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Post-training quantization is a key technique for reducing the memory and
inference latency of large language models by quantizing weights and
activations without requiring retraining. However, existing methods either (1)
fail to account for the varying importance of hidden features to the end loss
or, when incorporating end loss, (2) neglect the critical interactions between
model weights. To address these limitations, we propose GuidedQuant, a novel
quantization approach that integrates gradient information from the end loss
into the quantization objective while preserving cross-weight dependencies
within output channels. GuidedQuant consistently boosts the performance of
state-of-the-art quantization methods across weight-only scalar, weight-only
vector, and weight-and-activation quantization. Additionally, we introduce a
novel non-uniform scalar quantization algorithm, which is guaranteed to
monotonically decrease the quantization objective value, and outperforms
existing methods in this category. We release the code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器学习模型在缓慢分布偏移下的性能下降问题，现有方法难以察觉此类变化。

Method: 使用最优传输建模逐渐偏移，提出IUPM方法，量化性能预测的不确定性，并引入主动标注策略。

Result: IUPM在多种逐渐偏移场景中优于现有基线方法，其不确定性感知能更有效地指导标注获取。

Conclusion: IUPM是一种有效的无标签性能监测方法，适用于缓慢分布偏移场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual
distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading
to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose
Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free
method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using
optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the
performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a
reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that
IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual
shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition
more effectively compared to other strategies.

TL;DR: MaxRR提出了一种新的机器遗忘方法，通过改进标准遗忘指标和引入遗忘感知训练，实现了高效且精确的遗忘，部分情况下支持完全遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足法律要求（如被遗忘权），解决现有遗忘方法在效率和验证方面的不足。

Method: 提出广义遗忘指标和改进的训练流程（MaxRR），支持精确或接近完全遗忘。

Result: MaxRR在无法完全遗忘时仍能高效实现接近完全遗忘的效果。

Conclusion: MaxRR为机器遗忘提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is essential for meeting legal obligations such as the
right to be forgotten, which requires the removal of specific data from machine
learning models upon request. While several approaches to unlearning have been
proposed, existing solutions often struggle with efficiency and, more
critically, with the verification of unlearning - particularly in the case of
weak unlearning guarantees, where verification remains an open challenge. We
introduce a generalized variant of the standard unlearning metric that enables
more efficient and precise unlearning strategies. We also present an
unlearning-aware training procedure that, in many cases, allows for exact
unlearning. We term our approach MaxRR. When exact unlearning is not feasible,
MaxRR still supports efficient unlearning with properties closely matching
those achieved through full retraining.

Abstract: Diabetes remains a significant health challenge globally, contributing to
severe complications like kidney disease, vision loss, and heart issues. The
application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare enables efficient and
accurate disease prediction, offering avenues for early intervention and
patient support. Our study introduces an innovative diabetes prediction
framework, leveraging both traditional ML techniques such as Logistic
Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, and Random Forest and advanced ensemble methods
like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and XGBoost. Central to our
approach is the development of a novel model, DNet, a hybrid architecture
combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
layers for effective feature extraction and sequential learning. The DNet model
comprises an initial convolutional block for capturing essential features,
followed by a residual block with skip connections to facilitate efficient
information flow. Batch Normalization and Dropout are employed for robust
regularization, and an LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the
data. Using a Kaggle-sourced real-world diabetes dataset, our model evaluation
spans cross-validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Among the models, DNet demonstrates the highest efficacy with an accuracy of
99.79% and an AUC-ROC of 99.98%, establishing its potential for superior
diabetes prediction. This robust hybrid architecture showcases the value of
combining CNN and LSTM layers, emphasizing its applicability in medical
diagnostics and disease prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL HVAC控制在节能与热舒适性方面的有效性，及其在不同气候背景下的表现和跨城市适用性。

Method: 结合强化学习与城市气候模型，评估RL策略在不同气候条件下的效果、影响及跨城市适用性。

Result: 不同气候城市的RL策略效果差异显著，热气候城市表现更优，且气温变化大的城市策略更易跨城市应用。

Conclusion: 强调在不同气候背景下全面评估RL HVAC策略的重要性，并提出城市间学习可能有助于策略部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building
energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the
efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their
implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban
climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban
climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the
efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts
of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the
transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the
reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal
comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban
climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background
climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL
strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in
hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight
configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those
cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL
strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of
thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic
contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning
will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Method: 使用随机层次模型（RHM）生成合成数据集，并基于数据相关性的表示学习理论，分析卷积网络和Transformer模型的表现差异。

Result: 卷积网络由于局部性和权重共享的特性，其性能提升速度比依赖全局自注意力机制的Transformer模型更快。

Conclusion: 模型架构与数据统计特性的交互决定了表示学习的效果，卷积网络在捕捉层次结构时具有优势。

Abstract: How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for
next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling
laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the
Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free
grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language
while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of
representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep
learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially,
one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for
architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate
that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative
process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of
performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention
mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural
scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the
interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.

Motivation: 尽管局部反事实解释已被广泛研究，但全局反事实解释中的共同补救问题仍未探索，尤其是在GNNs中。

Method: 论文形式化了共同补救解释问题，并设计了COMRECGC算法来解决该问题。

Result: 在四个真实世界图数据集上，COMRECGC表现优于基线方法，且共同补救解释与图反事实解释相比具有可比性或更优性能。

Conclusion: 共同补救解释在药物发现或计算生物学等应用中值得考虑。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as
social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently,
different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box
nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two
types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification
into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation
consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the
input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an
''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small
set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an
''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied
extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual
explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we
formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective
algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong
baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the
superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the
common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing
that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making
them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational
biology.

TL;DR: MOG-DFM是一种多目标导向的离散流匹配框架，用于优化生物分子序列设计，解决多目标冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子工程中，设计满足多目标功能的序列是一个挑战，现有方法难以处理多目标或依赖连续嵌入。

Method: MOG-DFM结合混合排名-方向评分和自适应超锥过滤器，指导预训练的离散流匹配生成器实现帕累托效率。

Result: MOG-DFM成功优化了肽结合物的五种性质和DNA序列的特定增强子类别与形状。

Conclusion: MOG-DFM是生物分子多属性序列设计的强大工具。

Abstract: Designing biological sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting,
functional and biophysical criteria remains a central challenge in biomolecule
engineering. While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise
for efficient sampling in high-dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches
address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can
distort discrete distributions. We present Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow
Matching (MOG-DFM), a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete-time
flow matching generator toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across multiple
scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid
rank-directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive
hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi-objective progression. We also
trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, PepDFM for diverse
peptide generation and EnhancerDFM for functional enhancer DNA generation, as
base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG-DFM's effectiveness in
generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis,
non-fouling, solubility, half-life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA
sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM
proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence
design.

TL;DR: MIONet提出了一种新的多输入算子网络，通过显式编码时间动态性，准确预测移动载荷下的结构响应，比传统方法更高效且连续。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限元建模在动态载荷下计算量大，传统方法如DeepONet难以捕捉连续动态性，需要一种更高效且精确的模型。

Method: MIONet引入第二主干网络编码时间动态性，结合物理约束损失和Schur补集降低计算成本，实现空间和时间的连续预测。

Result: 在简单梁和KW-51桥上验证，达到有限元精度，推理速度比GRU-DeepONet快100倍以上。

Conclusion: MIONet适用于实时结构监测和数字孪生应用，具有高效性和连续性优势。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) modeling is essential for structural analysis but remains
computationally intensive, especially under dynamic loading. While operator
learning models have shown promise in replicating static structural responses
at FEM level accuracy, modeling dynamic behavior remains more challenging. This
work presents a Multiple Input Operator Network (MIONet) that incorporates a
second trunk network to explicitly encode temporal dynamics, enabling accurate
prediction of structural responses under moving loads. Traditional DeepONet
architectures using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are limited by fixed time
discretization and struggle to capture continuous dynamics. In contrast, MIONet
predicts responses continuously over both space and time, removing the need for
step wise modeling. It maps scalar inputs including load type, velocity,
spatial mesh, and time steps to full field structural responses. To improve
efficiency and enforce physical consistency, we introduce a physics informed
loss based on dynamic equilibrium using precomputed mass, damping, and
stiffness matrices, without solving the governing PDEs directly. Further, a
Schur complement formulation reduces the training domain, significantly cutting
computational costs while preserving global accuracy. The model is validated on
both a simple beam and the KW-51 bridge, achieving FEM level accuracy within
seconds. Compared to GRU based DeepONet, our model offers comparable accuracy
with improved temporal continuity and over 100 times faster inference, making
it well suited for real-time structural monitoring and digital twin
applications.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何在预测性能相似的情况下，根据用户需求个性化可解释模型（如GAMs）的配置。

Method: 采用上下文老虎机方法，通过在线实验（108名用户）对比个性化与非个性化配置的效果。

Result: 实验发现个性化配置能实现个体化而非通用化，同时保持高可解释性，用户对模型的理解度较高。

Conclusion: 研究初步揭示了可解释机器学习个性化的潜力。

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the observation that in machine learning (ML)
multiple models often achieve similar predictive performance while explaining
the underlying relationships in different ways. This observation holds even for
intrinsically interpretable models, such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs),
which offer users valuable insights into the model's behavior. Given the
existence of multiple GAM configurations with similar predictive performance, a
natural question is whether we can personalize these configurations based on
users' needs for interpretability. In our study, we developed an approach to
personalize models based on contextual bandits. In an online experiment with
108 users in a personalized treatment and a non-personalized control group, we
found that personalization led to individualized rather than one-size-fits-all
configurations. Despite these individual adjustments, the interpretability
remained high across both groups, with users reporting a strong understanding
of the models. Our research offers initial insights into the potential for
personalizing interpretable ML.

<details>

Motivation: 在从社会经济建模到生物系统分析的应用中，从最优概率分布的样本中估计参数是一个关键问题。这些分布通常由优化问题生成，涉及静态代理交互或动态系统演化。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，特别适用于机器学习和单细胞基因组学中的参数估计问题。

Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is
essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological
system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the
solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions
among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. Our approach
relies on minimizing a new class of loss functions, called sharpened
Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization
problem over the space of measures. We study the stability of this estimation
method when only a finite number of sample is available. The parameters to be
estimated typically correspond to a cost function in static problems and to a
potential function in dynamic problems. To analyze stability, we introduce a
general methodology that leverages the strong convexity of the loss function
together with the sample complexity of the forward optimization problem. Our
analysis emphasizes two specific settings in the context of optimal transport,
where our method provides explicit stability guarantees: The first is inverse
unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the
parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations;
this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The
second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a
potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via
the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is
particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell
genomics. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical experiments on
Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to
demonstrate the practical performance of our methods

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）虽减少数据泄露风险，但训练过程仍可能泄露敏感信息，尤其是成员推理攻击（MIA）威胁显著。

Method: 采用AugMixCloak方法，结合数据增强和PCA信息融合，通过感知哈希（pHash）检测查询图像是否与训练集相似。

Result: 实验表明，AugMixCloak在五种数据集和多种去中心化FL拓扑中，成功抵御基于二元分类器和度量的MIA，保护效果优于正则化防御和置信度掩码。

Conclusion: AugMixCloak在隐私保护方面表现优越，具有更强的防御能力和更好的泛化性。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning (ML) raises serious privacy concerns, while
federated learning (FL) mitigates the risk of data leakage by keeping data on
local devices. However, the training process of FL can still leak sensitive
information, which adversaries may exploit to infer private data. One of the
most prominent threats is the membership inference attack (MIA), where the
adversary aims to determine whether a particular data record was part of the
training set.
  This paper addresses this problem through a two-stage defense called
AugMixCloak. The core idea is to apply data augmentation and principal
component analysis (PCA)-based information fusion to query images, which are
detected by perceptual hashing (pHash) as either identical to or highly similar
to images in the training set. Experimental results show that AugMixCloak
successfully defends against both binary classifier-based MIA and metric-based
MIA across five datasets and various decentralized FL (DFL) topologies.
Compared with regularization-based defenses, AugMixCloak demonstrates stronger
protection. Compared with confidence score masking, AugMixCloak exhibits better
generalization.

Abstract: Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad
applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things.
Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the
generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios,
different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR
(Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing
methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing
mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily
lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we
propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different
Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly.
Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal
latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms.
Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and
estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based
neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under
the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent
variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses
existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with
different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 复杂性科学的核心问题对下一代科学建模仍至关重要，尤其是在物理信息AI和AI引导的复杂物理系统发现中。

Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying
unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual
organization of these measures is still missing.
  We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and
dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity)
and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical,
algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing
their computational accessibility and approximability.
  This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and
highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders,
latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural
networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent
spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise
management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical
foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems.
  We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided
discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of
complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.

Abstract: Predicting future vehicle purchases among existing owners presents a critical
challenge due to extreme class imbalance (<0.5% positive rate) and complex
behavioral patterns. We propose REMEDI (Relative feature Enhanced Meta-learning
with Distillation for Imbalanced prediction), a novel multi-stage framework
addressing these challenges. REMEDI first trains diverse base models to capture
complementary aspects of user behavior. Second, inspired by comparative
op-timization techniques, we introduce relative performance meta-features
(deviation from ensemble mean, rank among peers) for effective model fusion
through a hybrid-expert architecture. Third, we distill the ensemble's
knowledge into a single efficient model via supervised fine-tuning with MSE
loss, enabling practical deployment. Evaluated on approximately 800,000 vehicle
owners, REMEDI significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving the
business target of identifying ~50% of actual buyers within the top 60,000
recommendations at ~10% precision. The distilled model preserves the ensemble's

Conclusion: UMoE成功统一了注意力与FFN层的MoE设计，提升了模型性能与效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising
approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily
incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have
explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model
performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized
implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their
FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify the MoE designs in
attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention
mechanism, revealing an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules.
Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through
attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between
FFN and attention components.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM先验的高效缓存框架，显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM作为先验在RL中具有优势，但计算成本高，需解决效率问题。

Method: 采用自适应缓存机制，通过元优化缓存参数，减少LLM查询和延迟。

Result: 在离散和连续任务中，LLM查询减少3.8-4.7倍，延迟降低4.0-12.0倍，性能保留96-98%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限环境下具有通用性和实用性，离线RL中性能提升14-29%，训练时间减少38-40%。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) as priors in reinforcement learning
(RL) offers significant advantages but comes with substantial computational
costs. We present a principled cache-efficient framework for posterior sampling
with LLM-derived priors that dramatically reduces these costs while maintaining
high performance. At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism,
where cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived
from policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both
discrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control
domains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\times$ reduction in LLM queries
and 4.0--12.0$\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\,ms on a consumer GPU)
while retaining 96--98\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis
provides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically.
The framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves
performance by 14--29\% and reduces training time by 38--40\%. Extensive
evaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the
generalizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in
resource-constrained settings.

Result: 成功训练出优于当前最佳推理模型QwQ-32B的320亿参数模型。

Conclusion: INTELLECT-2展示了去中心化训练的可行性，并开源以促进相关研究。

Abstract: We introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement
learning (RL) training run of a 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike
traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model
using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of
permissionless compute contributors.
  To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various
components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework
purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top
of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted
inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights
from training nodes to inference workers.
  Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard
GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve
training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training
objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in
the 32B parameter range.
  We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to
encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.

Motivation: 传统强化学习（RL）的线性损失假设限制了应用范围，而凸损失（CURL）更具普适性，但非线性特性使经典Bellman方程失效，需要新方法。

Method: 采用在线镜像下降算法，结合动态约束集和探索奖励设计，并针对bandit版本的CURL，从bandit凸优化中借鉴技术。

Result: 实现了无需先验知识的近最优遗憾边界，并在bandit版本中获得了次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 该研究为CURL问题提供了高效算法，扩展了RL的应用范围，并为非线性损失下的在线学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We study online learning in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with convex objective functions, known as the concave utility
reinforcement learning (CURL) problem. This setting generalizes RL from linear
to convex losses on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's
policy. The non-linearity of CURL invalidates classical Bellman equations and
requires new algorithmic approaches. We introduce the first algorithm achieving
near-optimal regret bounds for online CURL without any prior knowledge on the
transition function. To achieve this, we use an online mirror descent algorithm
with varying constraint sets and a carefully designed exploration bonus. We
then address for the first time a bandit version of CURL, where the only
feedback is the value of the objective function on the state-action
distribution induced by the agent's policy. We achieve a sub-linear regret
bound for this more challenging problem by adapting techniques from bandit
convex optimization to the MDP setting.

Result: 实验表明，度量方法、任务和模型在不确定性特征上存在系统性差异。提出的任务特定度量选择方法优于基线策略。

Conclusion: 通过任务特定的不确定性度量选择，可以提升模型部署的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, which undermine their reliability in
real-world applications. While uncertainty estimation has emerged as a
promising strategy for detecting such errors, current metrics offer limited
interpretability and lack clarity about the types of uncertainty they capture.
In this paper, we present a systematic framework for decomposing LLM
uncertainty into four distinct sources, inspired by previous research. We
develop a source-specific estimation pipeline to quantify these uncertainty
types and evaluate how existing metrics relate to each source across tasks and
models. Our results show that metrics, task, and model exhibit systematic
variation in uncertainty characteristic. Building on this, we propose a method
for task specific metric/model selection guided by the alignment or divergence
between their uncertainty characteristics and that of a given task. Our
experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware
selection strategy consistently outperforms baseline strategies, helping us
select appropriate models or uncertainty metrics, and contributing to more
reliable and efficient deployment in uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: ACTLL框架有效解决了标签噪声问题，提升了医疗时间序列数据的预测准确性。

Abstract: Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies
on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR),
which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous
examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede
accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose
an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic
\textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy
\textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a
two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of
instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures
global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the
uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set.
Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and
several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that
our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under
high noise levels.

TL;DR: GenRe是一种生成式补救模型，通过联合训练三个补救目标（接近性、合理性和有效性）来优化推荐结果，避免了现有方法在推理时联合优化的不足，并在多个指标上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有补救方法在训练时单独优化目标，推理时联合优化，导致推荐效果不佳。

Method: 引入GenRe，联合训练三个补救目标，并通过生成模型直接采样生成最低成本补救方案。

Result: GenRe在成本、合理性和有效性之间取得了最佳平衡，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GenRe通过联合训练和生成模型采样，显著提升了补救推荐的效果和效率。

Abstract: Algorithmic Recourse provides recommendations to individuals who are
adversely impacted by automated model decisions, on how to alter their profiles
to achieve a favorable outcome. Effective recourse methods must balance three
conflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost,
plausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired
outcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately
and then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse
goals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce
GenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse
objectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack
of direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such
supervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent
estimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent
based search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over
the generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior
performance across multiple metrics. We also demonstrate GenRe provides the
best trade-off between cost, plausibility and validity, compared to
state-of-art baselines. Our code is available at:

Result: 证明了收敛和有限迭代解的泛化边界，后者具有随时有效性，可用于制定停止规则。

Conclusion: 通过半监督学习的实例验证了边界和停止规则的有效性，为实践者提供了保证互惠学习算法性能的工具。

Abstract: Many learning paradigms self-select training data in light of previously
learned parameters. Examples include active learning, semi-supervised learning,
bandits, or boosting. Rodemann et al. (2024) unify them under the framework of
"reciprocal learning". In this article, we address the question of how well
these methods can generalize from their self-selected samples. In particular,
we prove universal generalization bounds for reciprocal learning using covering
numbers and Wasserstein ambiguity sets. Our results require no assumptions on
the distribution of self-selected data, only verifiable conditions on the
algorithms. We prove results for both convergent and finite iteration
solutions. The latter are anytime valid, thereby giving rise to stopping rules
for a practitioner seeking to guarantee the out-of-sample performance of their
reciprocal learning algorithm. Finally, we illustrate our bounds and stopping
rules for reciprocal learning's special case of semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: ICE-Pruning是一种高效且实用的DNN剪枝方法，适用于多种模型和数据集。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size.
However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically
combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding
weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then
fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each
step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this
approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated
fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs
that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the
overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing
pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an
automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should
be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning
step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further
improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time
consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the
hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components.
We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can
accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统方法需要手动提取统计特征来确定惩罚参数，效率低且不准确。

Method: 使用循环神经网络直接从原始序列中学习惩罚参数，自动提取特征。

Result: 在20个基准基因组数据集上的实验表明，新方法在大多数情况下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 新方法通过自动学习惩罚参数，显著提高了变化点检测的准确性。

Abstract: Changepoint detection identifies significant shifts in data sequences, making
it important in areas like finance, genetics, and healthcare. The Optimal
Partitioning algorithms efficiently detect these changes, using a penalty
parameter to limit the changepoints number. Determining the appropriate value
for this penalty can be challenging. Traditionally, this process involved
manually extracting statistical features, such as sequence length or variance
to make the prediction. This study proposes a novel approach that uses
recurrent neural networks to learn this penalty directly from raw sequences by
automatically extracting features. Experiments conducted on 20 benchmark
genomic datasets show that this novel method surpasses traditional methods in
partitioning accuracy in most cases.

Result: 实验表明，LEAD在四个基准测试中平均性能提升6.1%-10.8%，仅用2.5%的训练数据，训练时间减少5-10倍。

Conclusion: LEAD通过高效数据选择解决了计算瓶颈，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for improving the
capabilities and alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
iterative model-aware data selection methods incur significant computational
overhead, as they rely on repeatedly performing full-dataset model inference to
estimate sample utility for subsequent training iterations, creating a
fundamental efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient
iterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility
entirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly
additional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic
Uncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining
instantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and
exponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently
to large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy,
adaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit
mechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples
using IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model
performance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and
reducing overall training time by 5-10x.

Motivation: 现有研究通常将多步和少步生成模型视为独立范式，导致训练和采样方法分离。论文旨在统一这些方法。

Method: 提出了UCGM-{T,S}框架，统一训练、采样和分析多步和少步生成模型。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，UCGM-T训练的多步模型在20步达到1.30 FID，少步模型在2步达到1.42 FID；UCGM-S将预训练模型的性能从1.26 FID（250步）提升至1.06 FID（40步）。

Conclusion: UCGM框架成功统一了多步和少步生成模型，显著提升了生成效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step
approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000
sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8
steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing
work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate
training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for
training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified
Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a
675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID
in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps.
Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at
250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available

Conclusion: PAH框架在持续学习中表现出色，无需存储样本或分类器头即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting
prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the
weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose
Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single
hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates
task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines
cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to
align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks.
Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7
% and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing
samples or heads.

Conclusion: SDO是一种通用、高效且轻量级的方法，适用于扩散采样中所有参数类型的优化。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in
modeling large-scale data distributions. However, many downstream tasks require
guiding the generated content based on specific differentiable metrics,
typically necessitating backpropagation during the generation process. This
approach is computationally expensive, as generating with DMs often demands
tens to hundreds of recursive network calls, resulting in high memory usage and
significant time consumption. In this paper, we propose a more efficient
alternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel
denoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation
process is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining
the computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a
shortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call Shortcut
Diffusion Optimization (SDO), is generic, high-performance, and computationally
lightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of SDO on several real-world tasks, including
controlling generation by optimizing latent and aligning the DMs by fine-tuning
network parameters. Compared to full backpropagation, our approach reduces
computational costs by $\sim 90\%$ while maintaining superior performance. Code

Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely
observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various
scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the
algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution,
when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct
codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches
approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian
processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model
fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose
leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an
interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model
fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the
significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect
identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing
the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model
regression-based approaches.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is a popular and vital task in various real-world
scenarios, which has been studied for several decades. Recently, many studies
extending deep learning-based methods have shown preferable performance on
graph anomaly detection. However, existing methods are lack of efficiency that
is definitely necessary for embedded devices. Towards this end, we propose an
Efficient Anomaly detection model on heterogeneous Graphs via contrastive
LEarning (EAGLE) by contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of
their distances to the local context. The proposed method first samples
instance pairs on meta path-level for contrastive learning. Then, a graph
autoencoder-based model is applied to learn informative node embeddings in an
unsupervised way, which will be further combined with the discriminator to
predict the anomaly scores of nodes. Experimental results show that EAGLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three heterogeneous network

Method: 在Ditto框架中引入理论支持的自适应MMD度量，以优化模型性能。

Result: 自适应MMD度量显著提升了模型性能，特别是在特征异构性明显的任务中。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，针对FL系统中的异构性设计定制化约束是有效的，且该方法可推广到其他pFL场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become an effective and widely used approach to
training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct
clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training
data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between
distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL)
methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling
specific to each client's unique characteristics. In this work, the efficacy of
theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures within the Ditto framework, a
state-of-the-art technique in pFL, are investigated. The use of such measures
significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially
those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. While the Ditto algorithm is
specifically considered, such measures are directly applicable to a number of
other pFL settings, and the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to
the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.

### [239] [Kalman Filter Enhanced GRPO for Reinforcement Learning-Based Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07527)
*Hu Wang,Congbo Ma,Ian Reid,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRPO通过轻量级卡尔曼滤波动态估计奖励均值和方差，改进GRPO的优势估计，提升语言模型在动态奖励环境中的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在奖励噪声高的环境中可能导致不准确的优势估计，引入偏差，因此需要更自适应的优势归一化方法。

Method: 提出KRPO模型，利用卡尔曼滤波动态估计潜在奖励均值和方差，替代GRPO的朴素批次均值基线。

Result: 实验表明，KRPO能提升GRPO的稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: KRPO是一种简单有效的方法，适用于动态奖励信号难以建模的语言模型场景。

Abstract: Reward baseline is important for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to
reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is proposed to compute the advantage
for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all
outputs in the group. However, it can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates in
environments with highly noisy rewards, potentially introducing bias. In this
work, we propose a model, called Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization (KRPO), by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically
estimate the latent reward mean and variance. This filtering technique replaces
the naive batch mean baseline, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization.
Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This
approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of
GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where
highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models.
Through experiments and analyses, we show that using a more adaptive advantage
estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The
code is available at https://github.com/billhhh/KRPO_LLMs_RL

*Lingkun Luo,Shiqiang Hu,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOCDDA提出了一种结合条件扩散模型和领域适应（DA）的方法，通过优化噪声生成高置信伪标签目标域样本（hcpl-tds），提升跨域对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪标签方法在无监督领域适应（UDA）中因高置信伪标签样本稀缺导致跨域统计对齐不准确，NOCDDA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: NOCDDA将条件扩散模型的生成能力与DA的决策需求结合，通过统一优化框架调整DA分类器，并引入类感知噪声优化策略生成更准确的hcpl-tds。

Result: 在5个基准数据集和29个DA任务上的实验表明，NOCDDA显著优于31种现有方法。

Conclusion: NOCDDA通过噪声优化和条件扩散模型的有效结合，显著提升了跨域对齐的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a cornerstone of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), yet
the scarcity of High-Confidence Pseudo-Labeled Target Domain Samples
(\textbf{hcpl-tds}) often leads to inaccurate cross-domain statistical
alignment, causing DA failures. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{N}oise \textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion for
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly
integrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the
decision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for
efficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA
classifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified
optimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain
samples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},
\mathbf{I}) \) initialization in diffusion models often generates
class-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we
introduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling
regions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing
cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments across 5 benchmark datasets and
29 DA tasks demonstrate significant performance gains of \textbf{NOCDDA} over
31 state-of-the-art methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness.

Motivation: 将知识图谱的结构化知识整合到大型语言模型中是一个关键挑战，现有方法（如提示工程或微调）会丢失结构保真度或计算成本高。

Method: 利用知识图谱嵌入（KGE）模型将图嵌入作为LLM输入的一部分，实现图感知推理，该方法与模型无关且资源高效。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在推理性能上优于现有基线，并在准确性和效率上达到了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为知识图谱与大型语言模型的结合提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large
Language Models (LLMs) remains a key challenge for symbolic reasoning. Existing
methods mainly rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning, which lose structural
fidelity or incur high computational costs. Building on recent encoding
techniques which integrate graph embeddings within the LLM input as tokens, we
extend this paradigm to the KG domain by leveraging Knowledge Graph Embedding
(KGE) models, thus enabling graph-aware reasoning. Our approach is
model-agnostic, resource-efficient, and compatible with any LLMs. Extensive
experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our method
improves reasoning performance over established baselines, further achieving
the best trade-off in terms of accuracy and efficiency against state-of-the-art
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端间的统计异质性是一个关键挑战，现有方法（如聚类方法）难以捕捉复杂的客户端关系。

Method: 提出KARULA策略，基于1-Wasserstein距离的代理度量约束客户端模型差异，并使用一种不精确的投影随机梯度算法求解约束问题。

Result: 理论证明算法在平滑（可能非凸）损失下收敛到稳定点邻域，收敛速率为O(1/K)。实验验证了KARULA在合成和真实联邦数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: KARULA通过正则化策略有效解决了联邦学习中的统计异质性问题，并展示了理论和实践上的优势。

Abstract: One of the defining challenges in federated learning is that of statistical
heterogeneity among clients. We address this problem with KARULA, a regularized
strategy for personalized federated learning, which constrains the pairwise
model dissimilarities between clients based on the difference in their
distributions, as measured by a surrogate for the 1-Wasserstein distance
adapted for the federated setting. This allows the strategy to adapt to highly
complex interrelations between clients, that e.g., clustered approaches fail to
capture. We propose an inexact projected stochastic gradient algorithm to solve
the constrained problem that the strategy defines, and show theoretically that
it converges with smooth, possibly non-convex losses to a neighborhood of a
stationary point with rate O(1/K). We demonstrate the effectiveness of KARULA
on synthetic and real federated data sets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在拜占庭攻击下具有鲁棒性，适用于多种实际场景，且收敛性能与经典算法相当。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance while also
increasing computational demands. While federated and distributed setups
address these issues, their structure is vulnerable to malicious influences. In
this paper, we address a specific threat, Byzantine attacks, where compromised
clients inject adversarial updates to derail global convergence. We combine the
trust scores concept with trial function methodology to dynamically filter
outliers. Our methods address the critical limitations of previous approaches,
allowing functionality even when Byzantine nodes are in the majority. Moreover,
our algorithms adapt to widely used scaled methods like Adam and RMSProp, as
well as practical scenarios, including local training and partial
participation. We validate the robustness of our methods by conducting
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real ECG data collected from
medical institutions. Furthermore, we provide a broad theoretical analysis of
our algorithms and their extensions to aforementioned practical setups. The
convergence guarantees of our methods are comparable to those of classical
algorithms developed without Byzantine interference.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) 在联邦学习框架中表现优于传统多层感知机 (MLP)，具有更高的准确性、稳定性和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 MLP 在处理复杂数据集时难以高效捕捉非线性关系，而 KAN 基于 Kolmogorov-Arnold 表示定理，有望解决这一问题。

Method: 在联邦学习框架中比较 KAN 和 MLP 的性能，实验覆盖四个数据集，并评估多种参数聚合策略。

Result: KAN 在准确性、稳定性和收敛效率上均优于 MLP，且在非独立同分布数据和客户端数量变化时表现稳健。

Conclusion: KAN 是联邦学习中 MLP 的强有力替代方案，适用于去中心化和隐私保护环境。

Abstract: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), as a simple yet powerful model, continues to be
widely used in classification and regression tasks. However, traditional MLPs
often struggle to efficiently capture nonlinear relationships in load data when
dealing with complex datasets. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), inspired by
the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, have shown promising capabilities
in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. In this study, we explore the
performance of KANs within federated learning (FL) frameworks and compare them
to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons. Our experiments, conducted across four
diverse datasets demonstrate that KANs consistently outperform MLPs in terms of
accuracy, stability, and convergence efficiency. KANs exhibit remarkable
robustness under varying client numbers and non-IID data distributions,
maintaining superior performance even as client heterogeneity increases.
Notably, KANs require fewer communication rounds to converge compared to MLPs,
highlighting their efficiency in FL scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate
multiple parameter aggregation strategies, with trimmed mean and FedProx
emerging as the most effective for optimizing KAN performance. These findings
establish KANs as a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs for federated
learning tasks, paving the way for their application in decentralized and
privacy-preserving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法通常基于单一指标（如保真度或简洁性）生成解释性子图，可能导致解释偏差，无法全面阐明GNN模型的输出。

Method: 提出了skyline解释范式，将解释生成建模为多目标优化问题，设计了基于洋葱剥皮策略的高效算法，并进一步开发了多样化解释的算法。

Result: 在真实世界图上验证了算法的有效性、效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: skyline解释方法通过多目标优化和多样化策略，提供了更全面的GNN解释。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to generate subgraph explanations for
graph neural networks GNNs that simultaneously optimize multiple measures for
explainability. Existing GNN explanation methods often compute subgraphs
(called ``explanatory subgraphs'') that optimize a pre-defined, single
explainability measure, such as fidelity or conciseness. This can lead to
biased explanations that cannot provide a comprehensive explanation to clarify
the output of GNN models. We introduce skyline explanation, a GNN explanation
paradigm that aims to identify k explanatory subgraphs by simultaneously
optimizing multiple explainability measures. (1) We formulate skyline
explanation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and pursue
explanations that approximate a skyline set of explanatory subgraphs. We show
the hardness for skyline explanation generation. (2) We design efficient
algorithms with an onion-peeling approach that strategically removes edges from
neighbors of nodes of interests, and incrementally improves explanations as it
explores an interpretation domain, with provable quality guarantees. (3) We
further develop an algorithm to diversify explanations to provide more
comprehensive perspectives. Using real-world graphs, we empirically verify the
effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our algorithms.

Result: 在Abilene数据集上，模型在多项指标上表现优于其他深度学习方法，且具有稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的GCN-GRU模型在复杂网络流量预测中表现出色，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study focuses on the challenge of predicting network traffic within
complex topological environments. It introduces a spatiotemporal modeling
approach that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU). The GCN component captures spatial dependencies among
network nodes, while the GRU component models the temporal evolution of traffic
data. This combination allows for precise forecasting of future traffic
patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through
comprehensive experiments on the real-world Abilene network traffic dataset.
The model is benchmarked against several popular deep learning methods.
Furthermore, a set of ablation experiments is conducted to examine the
influence of various components on performance, including changes in the number
of graph convolution layers, different temporal modeling strategies, and
methods for constructing the adjacency matrix. Results indicate that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance across multiple metrics,
demonstrating robust stability and strong generalization capabilities in
complex network traffic forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在资源受限环境中部署困难，现有的知识蒸馏方法通常需要多阶段训练或额外调优，增加了计算负担。

Method: 引入双预测头，分别从标记数据和教师预测中学习，并在推理时线性组合输出，减少梯度冲突。

Conclusion: DHO框架简单有效，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效率，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
tasks by leveraging rich textual information with minimal labeled data.
However, deploying such large models remains challenging, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a
well-established solution to this problem; however, recent KD approaches from
VLMs often involve multi-stage training or additional tuning, increasing
computational overhead and optimization complexity. In this paper, we propose
$\mathbf{\texttt{D}}$ual-$\mathbf{\texttt{H}}$ead
$\mathbf{\texttt{O}}$ptimization ($\mathbf{\texttt{DHO}}$) -- a simple yet
effective KD framework that transfers knowledge from VLMs to compact,
task-specific models in semi-supervised settings. Specifically, we introduce
dual prediction heads that independently learn from labeled data and teacher
predictions, and propose to linearly combine their outputs during inference. We
observe that $\texttt{DHO}$ mitigates gradient conflicts between supervised and
distillation signals, enabling more effective feature learning than single-head
KD baselines. As a result, extensive experiments show that $\texttt{DHO}$
consistently outperforms baselines across multiple domains and fine-grained
datasets. Notably, on ImageNet, it achieves state-of-the-art performance,
improving accuracy by 3% and 0.1% with 1% and 10% labeled data, respectively,
while using fewer parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a critical trade-off between inference
quality and computational cost: larger models offer superior capabilities but
incur significant latency, while smaller models are faster but less powerful.
Existing serving strategies often employ fixed model scales or static two-stage
speculative decoding, failing to dynamically adapt to the varying complexities
of user requests or fluctuations in system performance. This paper introduces
\systemname{}, a novel framework that reimagines LLM inference as an adaptive
routing problem solved through multi-level speculative decoding. \systemname{}
dynamically constructs and optimizes inference "paths" (chains of models) based
on real-time feedback, addressing the limitations of static approaches. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) An \textbf{adaptive model chain scheduling}
mechanism that leverages performance profiling (execution times) and predictive
similarity metrics (derived from token distribution divergence) to continuously
select the optimal sequence of draft and verifier models, minimizing predicted
latency per generated token. (2) A \textbf{multi-level collaborative
verification} framework where intermediate models within the selected chain can
validate speculative tokens, reducing the verification burden on the final,
most powerful target model. (3) A \textbf{synchronized state management} system
providing efficient, consistent KV cache handling across heterogeneous models
in the chain, including precise, low-overhead rollbacks tailored for
asynchronous batch processing inherent in multi-level speculation. Preliminary
experiments demonstrate the validity of our method.

Result: 多模态融合模型优于单模态模型，病理报告文本的加入显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究通过FMs和病理报告文本的信息提取，实现了生存预测模型的现代化。

Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a
large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image
data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from
unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning
is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature
embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially
has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as
pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we
investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models
over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive
effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the
benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect
of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize
survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology
reports.

Motivation: 糖尿病患者的时间序列数据（如血红蛋白A1c）对医生决策至关重要，但由于患者就诊时间点不同，聚类时难以捕捉趋势和模式。

Method: 结合欧几里得距离和皮尔逊相关性的新算法4TaStiC，用于聚类时间序列数据。

Result: 在人工数据集上，4TaStiC优于七种现有方法；在1,989名2型糖尿病患者数据中，聚类结果清晰且实用。

Conclusion: 4TaStiC算法在医疗领域和其他领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by
persistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal
organs and systems. Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a
time series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each
patient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations.
Clustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists
doctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to
review all records. However, time series clustering of this type of dataset
introduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time
points, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns.
Additionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of
laboratory results and differences in trends and patterns. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend
Traveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure
combined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics. We evaluated this
algorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven
existing methods. The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods
on the targeted datasets. Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of
1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital. Each group of patients
exhibits clear characteristics that will benefit doctors in making efficient
clinical decisions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to
contexts outside the medical field.

Abstract: Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range
of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to
substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains
such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the
ability of reasoning models to directly perform chemistry tasks, without any
assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ,
which consists of 796 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry,
focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires
models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world
applications. The reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3-mini, correctly
answered 28%-59% of questions depending on the reasoning level used, with
higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks.
These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning model, GPT-4o, which
achieved only 7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert
SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform.
Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures
from 1H and 13C NMR data, correctly generating SMILES strings for 74% of
molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure
comprising 21 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning
process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the
latest reasoning models have the ability to perform advanced chemical
reasoning.

Abstract: Algorithm selection, aiming to identify the best algorithm for a given
problem, plays a pivotal role in continuous black-box optimization. A common
approach involves representing optimization functions using a set of features,
which are then used to train a machine learning meta-model for selecting
suitable algorithms. Various approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of
these algorithm selection meta-models. However, not all evaluation approaches
are equally valid for assessing the performance of meta-models. We highlight
methodological issues that frequently occur in the community and should be
addressed when evaluating algorithm selection approaches. First, we identify
flaws with the "leave-instance-out" evaluation technique. We show that
non-informative features and meta-models can achieve high accuracy, which
should not be the case with a well-designed evaluation framework. Second, we
demonstrate that measuring the performance of optimization algorithms with
metrics sensitive to the scale of the objective function requires careful
consideration of how this impacts the construction of the meta-model, its
predictions, and the model's error. Such metrics can falsely present overly
optimistic performance assessments of the meta-models. This paper emphasizes
the importance of careful evaluation, as loosely defined methodologies can
mislead researchers, divert efforts, and introduce noise into the field

Abstract: Obtaining real-world network datasets is often challenging because of
privacy, security, and computational constraints. In the absence of such
datasets, graph generative models become essential tools for creating synthetic
datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning model for
generating high-fidelity synthetic network flow datasets that are
representative of real-world networks. Our approach involves the generation of
dynamic multigraphs using a stochastic Kronecker graph generator for structure
generation and a tabular generative adversarial network for feature generation.
We further employ an XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model for graph
alignment, ensuring accurate overlay of features onto the generated graph
structure. We evaluate our model using new metrics that assess both the
accuracy and diversity of the synthetic graphs. Our results demonstrate
improvements in accuracy over previous large-scale graph generation methods
while maintaining similar efficiency. We also explore the trade-off between
accuracy and diversity in synthetic graph dataset creation, a topic not
extensively covered in related works. Our contributions include the synthesis
and evaluation of large real-world netflow datasets and the definition of new
metrics for evaluating synthetic graph generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-Dojo是一个交互式框架，用于通过强化学习迭代改进大型语言模型（LLM）代理，覆盖多样化的机器学习工程任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要依赖静态数据集或单次评估，无法支持迭代改进。MLE-Dojo旨在提供一个交互环境，通过结构化反馈循环帮助代理实验、调试和优化解决方案。

Method: 基于200多个真实Kaggle挑战构建，支持监督微调和强化学习，提供可执行环境以实现迭代实验和实时验证。

Result: 评估显示，当前LLM在迭代改进方面有意义，但在生成长期解决方案和解决复杂错误方面仍有局限。

Conclusion: MLE-Dojo的开源框架促进了社区驱动的创新，支持模型代理调优和可扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically reinforcement
learning, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM)
agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. Unlike
existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt
evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to
iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback
loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse,
open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering
scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning,
and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive
agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,
facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time
outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that
while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still
exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon
solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's
flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data
sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent
tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We
open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation
towards next-generation MLE agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）的扩展面临瓶颈，噪声效应是主要原因。研究旨在通过控制噪声和利用小模型（SLM）的互补优势，提升性能。

Method: 提出“相对过拟合”概念和AR框架，结合LLM和SLM，验证其在语言建模、长文本任务等场景的效果。

Result: 实验表明，AR框架能以更低参数和计算成本显著提升性能，且效果稳定、通用。

Conclusion: AR框架有望帮助突破扩展瓶颈，并在其他领域如CV和AI科学中应用。

Abstract: Currently, the scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces challenges
and bottlenecks. This paper posits that noise effects, stemming from changes in
the signal-to-noise ratio under diminishing marginal returns, are the root
cause of these issues. To control this noise, we investigated the differences
between models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the
concept of "relative overfitting." Based on their complementary strengths, we
have proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR). In Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium
for discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive
influence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected
negative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on
mainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple
datasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject
examination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate
that through our structure, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can
achieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and
computational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal,
stable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of "relative
overfitting" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as
computer vision (CV) and AI for science. We hope the proposed approach can help
scale laws overcome existing bottlenecks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨固定大小的循环内存如何影响大型长上下文模型的性能，以及如何优化其长上下文处理能力。

Method: 采用分块推理方法，识别并仅处理输入中最相关的部分，以缓解循环内存的不足。

Result: 在LongBench上，该方法显著提升了多个模型的性能（提升14%至51%），并在LongBench v2上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究质疑循环模型是否真正利用了长距离依赖关系，因为单块策略在需要跨上下文关系的任务中表现更优。

Abstract: A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that
improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large
long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects
their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are
trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains
underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference
procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the
input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many
long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance
of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%,
RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this
simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging
LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size
Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent
models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy
delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require
cross-context relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习决策缺乏透明度，限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用，需要可解释的方法增强信任。

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释和可信的强化学习提供了理论基础，统一并扩展了现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their
decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits
deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and
accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features,
which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three
core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from
explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent
achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat
state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley
values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the
influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically
grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use
illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition
and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making
explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled
foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: NewsNet-SDF是一种深度学习框架，通过对抗网络将预训练语言模型嵌入与金融时间序列结合，显著提升了资产定价和风险评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SDF模型难以整合非结构化文本信息，而金融市场中新闻等文本数据对资产定价有重要影响。

Method: 采用多模态架构，结合GTE多语言模型处理新闻、LSTM提取宏观经济数据时间模式，并通过对抗训练机制融合异构数据。

Result: 在1980-2022年美国股票数据上，Sharpe比率达2.80，显著优于CAPM、传统SDF和Fama-French五因子模型。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习方法有效整合文本与金融数据，为金融科技中的智能决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) models provide a unified framework for asset
pricing and risk assessment, yet traditional formulations struggle to
incorporate unstructured textual information. We introduce NewsNet-SDF, a novel
deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates pretrained language model
embeddings with financial time series through adversarial networks. Our
multimodal architecture processes financial news using GTE-multilingual models,
extracts temporal patterns from macroeconomic data via LSTM networks, and
normalizes firm characteristics, fusing these heterogeneous information sources
through an innovative adversarial training mechanism. Our dataset encompasses
approximately 2.5 million news articles and 10,000 unique securities,
addressing the computational challenges of processing and aligning text data
with financial time series. Empirical evaluations on U.S. equity data
(1980-2022) demonstrate NewsNet-SDF substantially outperforms alternatives with
a Sharpe ratio of 2.80. The model shows a 471% improvement over CAPM, over 200%
improvement versus traditional SDF implementations, and a 74% reduction in
pricing errors compared to the Fama-French five-factor model. In comprehensive
comparisons, our deep learning approach consistently outperforms traditional,
modern, and other neural asset pricing models across all key metrics. Ablation
studies confirm that text embeddings contribute significantly more to model
performance than macroeconomic features, with news-derived principal components
ranking among the most influential determinants of SDF dynamics. These results
validate the effectiveness of our multimodal deep learning approach in
integrating unstructured text with traditional financial data for more accurate
asset pricing, providing new insights for digital intelligent decision-making
in financial technology.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过感知一致性实现了高效的特征表示迁移，为学生模型提供了更好的放松条件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to
lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define
a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we
propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between
data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by
minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the
teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is
motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model
is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method
allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not
need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving
global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights
provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation
transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves
on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation
transferring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平表示学习算法仅适用于分类敏感属性，无法处理连续敏感属性（如年龄或收入），因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 提出EIPM度量评估公平性，并设计FREM算法，利用EIPM和MMD实现公平表示学习。

Result: 实验证明FREM算法优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FREM算法为连续敏感属性的公平表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI fairness, also known as algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that
algorithms operate without bias or discrimination towards any individual or
group. Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL)
approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL
algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical
sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive
attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm
for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the
Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level
of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate
that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any
prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair,
regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses
a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our
proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a
new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM).
Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.

Result: 理论证明了IWOGA + HDIWIC在合理假设下具有最优收敛速率。

Conclusion: IWOGA + HDIWIC组合在高维模型选择中具有理论最优性。

Abstract: Imori and Ing (2025) proposed the importance-weighted orthogonal greedy
algorithm (IWOGA) for model selection in high-dimensional misspecified
regression models under covariate shift. To determine the number of IWOGA
iterations, they introduced the high-dimensional importance-weighted
information criterion (HDIWIC). They argued that the combined use of IWOGA and
HDIWIC, IWOGA + HDIWIC, achieves an optimal trade-off between variance and
squared bias, leading to optimal convergence rates in terms of conditional mean
squared prediction error. In this article, we provide a theoretical
justification for this claim by establishing the optimality of IWOGA + HDIWIC
under a set of reasonable assumptions.

Result: 边界条件能够显著改善遗憾界，证明了高质量成对比较数据的重要性，且这一改进与具体估计器无关，适用于多种学习算法和模型。

Conclusion: 清晰的人类信念和高质量的成对比较数据是强化学习从人类反馈中成功的关键因素，且这一结论具有普适性。

Abstract: In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise
comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic
regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which
depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the
critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type
condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal
action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This
condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical
efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear
human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality
pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent
of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning
algorithms and models.

Result: 展示了每种核方法如何从两种策略中衍生，并讨论了它们的适用场景。

Conclusion: 不同情况下可能需要选择投影或受限重建策略，具体取决于需求。

Abstract: The problem of using proximity (similarity or dissimilarity) data for the
purpose of "adding a point to a vector diagram" was first studied by J.C. Gower
in 1968. Since then, a number of methods -- mostly kernel methods -- have been
proposed for solving what has come to be called the problem of *out-of-sample
embedding*. We survey the various kernel methods that we have encountered and
show that each can be derived from one or the other of two competing
strategies: *projection* or *restricted reconstruction*. Projection can be
analogized to a well-known formula for adding a point to a principal component
analysis. Restricted reconstruction poses a different challenge: how to best
approximate redoing the entire multivariate analysis while holding fixed the
vector diagram that was previously obtained. This strategy results in a
nonlinear optimization problem that can be simplified to a unidimensional
search. Various circumstances may warrant either projection or restricted
reconstruction.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on
diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating
high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast
existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. %This remarkable ability
may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In
this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et
al. (2021), shifting the focus from a "learning" problem to a "sampling"
problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing
diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential
Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the
gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be
unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical
solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This
reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions
with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently
encountered in Bayesian statistics.

Motivation: 现有分类性能指标因尺度和对类别不平衡敏感性的差异，难以直接比较和解释，尤其是在不平衡率变化时。

Method: 引入超越分数函数，将任何基于混淆矩阵的分类性能指标映射到统一的[0,1]尺度，并提供清晰的解释。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种真实数据集上具有鲁棒性，并能有效比较不同不平衡率下的分类性能。

Conclusion: 超越分数函数为分类性能指标提供了一个统一的比较框架，解决了不平衡率变化带来的问题。

Abstract: Many classification performance metrics exist, each suited to a specific
application. However, these metrics often differ in scale and can exhibit
varying sensitivity to class imbalance rates in the test set. As a result, it
is difficult to use the nominal values of these metrics to interpret and
evaluate classification performances, especially when imbalance rates vary. To
address this problem, we introduce the outperformance score function, a
universal standardization method for confusion-matrix-based classification
performance (CMBCP) metrics. It maps any given metric to a common scale of
$[0,1]$, while providing a clear and consistent interpretation. Specifically,
the outperformance score represents the percentile rank of the observed
classification performance within a reference distribution of possible
performances. This unified framework enables meaningful comparison and
monitoring of classification performance across test sets with differing
imbalance rates. We illustrate how the outperformance scores can be applied to
a variety of commonly used classification performance metrics and demonstrate
the robustness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets
spanning multiple classification applications.

Motivation: 研究神经缩放定律的成因，特别是在分类和下一标记预测任务中，探索幂律分布和分层结构对学习曲线的影响。

Method: 使用概率上下文无关文法生成数据，分析分类和下一标记预测任务中幂律分布规则对学习曲线的影响。

Result: 分类任务中，幂律分布规则导致学习曲线呈幂律分布，指数取决于规则分布，而分层结构影响乘性常数；下一标记预测任务中，规则分布仅影响学习曲线的局部细节，不影响大尺度行为的指数。

Conclusion: 论文统一了神经缩放定律的两种解释，揭示了不同任务中幂律分布和分层结构对学习曲线的不同影响。

Abstract: Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is
linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling
laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as
is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider
classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic
context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a
hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having
power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve
with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large
multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By
contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules
controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent
describing the large-scale behaviour.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够唯一地恢复交互核（尺度除外），并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the data-driven identification of asymmetric
interaction kernels in the Motsch-Tadmor model based on observed trajectory
data. The model under consideration is governed by a class of semilinear
evolution equations, where the interaction kernel defines a normalized,
state-dependent Laplacian operator that governs collective dynamics. To address
the resulting nonlinear inverse problem, we propose a variational framework
that reformulates kernel identification using the implicit form of the
governing equations, reducing it to a subspace identification problem. We
establish an identifiability result that characterizes conditions under which
the interaction kernel can be uniquely recovered up to scale. To solve the
inverse problem robustly, we develop a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm that
incorporates informative priors for regularization, quantifies uncertainty, and
enables principled model selection. Extensive numerical experiments on
representative interacting particle systems demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework across a range of
noise levels and data regimes.

Abstract: Contextual online decision-making problems with constraints appear in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation with
resource limits, adaptive experimental design, and decision-making under safety
or fairness requirements. In this paper, we investigate a general formulation
of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility constraints, where at
each round, the learner must select an action based on observed context while
ensuring that a problem-specific feasibility criterion is satisfied. We propose
a unified algorithmic framework that captures many existing constrained
learning problems, including constrained bandits, active learning with label
budgets, online hypothesis testing with Type I error control, and model
calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper counterfactual
confidence bounds, which enables the design of practically efficient online
algorithms with strong theoretical guarantee using any offline conditional
density estimation oracle. Technically, to handle feasibility constraints in
complex environments, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension
- extending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader
class of metric-like probability divergences. This allows us to capture the
complexity of various density function classes and characterize the utility
regret incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a
principled foundation for constrained sequential decision-making in both theory
and practice.

Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce Bayesian filtering as a principled framework for
tackling diverse sequential machine learning problems, including online
(continual) learning, prequential (one-step-ahead) forecasting, and contextual
bandits. To this end, this thesis addresses key challenges in applying Bayesian
filtering to these problems: adaptivity to non-stationary environments,
robustness to model misspecification and outliers, and scalability to the
high-dimensional parameter space of deep neural networks. We develop novel
tools within the Bayesian filtering framework to address each of these
challenges, including: (i) a modular framework that enables the development
adaptive approaches for online learning; (ii) a novel, provably robust filter
with similar computational cost to standard filters, that employs Generalised
Bayes; and (iii) a set of tools for sequentially updating model parameters
using approximate second-order optimisation methods that exploit the
overparametrisation of high-dimensional parametric models such as neural
networks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the improved
performance of our methods in dynamic, high-dimensional, and misspecified
models.

TL;DR: ALPCAH是一种新的子空间学习方法，能够估计样本噪声方差并改进低秩数据子空间基的估计，适用于异方差数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA在处理异方差数据时效果有限，需要一种能适应不同数据质量的方法。

Method: ALPCAH通过估计样本噪声方差并利用软秩约束改进子空间基估计，无需噪声方差或子空间维度先验知识。

Result: 模拟和真实数据实验表明，ALPCAH在异方差数据中优于现有算法。

Conclusion: ALPCAH为异方差数据提供了一种有效的子空间学习方法，且其矩阵分解版本LR-ALPCAH在速度和内存效率上更优。

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data
dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data
that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data
sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This
paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the
sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of
the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our
method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does
not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft
rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known.
Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named
LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of
requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real
data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data
heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms. Code available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高维环境下的机器学习遗忘算法，通过理论指导的牛顿步骤和噪声添加，确保遗忘数据的彻底移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维环境中机器学习遗忘的挑战，扩展低维环境下的理论保证。

Method: 从原始模型参数出发，进行1-2次牛顿步骤，并添加各向同性拉普拉斯噪声。

Result: 在高维环境中，单次牛顿步骤不足以有效遗忘，但两次步骤可达到认证效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在高维环境中实现了有效的遗忘，并通过数值实验验证了其认证性和准确性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on the computationally efficient removal of
specific training data from trained models, ensuring that the influence of
forgotten data is effectively eliminated without the need for full retraining.
Despite advances in low-dimensional settings, where the number of parameters \(
p \) is much smaller than the sample size \( n \), extending similar
theoretical guarantees to high-dimensional regimes remains challenging. We
propose an unlearning algorithm that starts from the original model parameters
and performs a theory-guided sequence of Newton steps \( T \in \{ 1,2\}\).
After this update, carefully scaled isotropic Laplacian noise is added to the
estimate to ensure that any (potential) residual influence of forget data is
completely removed. We show that when both \( n, p \to \infty \) with a fixed
ratio \( n/p \), significant theoretical and computational obstacles arise due
to the interplay between the complexity of the model and the finite
signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we show that, unlike in low-dimensional
settings, a single Newton step is insufficient for effective unlearning in
high-dimensional problems -- however, two steps are enough to achieve the
desired certifiebility. We provide numerical experiments to support the
certifiability and accuracy claims of this approach.

Method: 扩展核岭回归至向量值设置，引入正则化项，构建可分离核结构，并提供高斯过程解释。

Result: 迁移学习显著提升了外推性能并缩小了置信区间。

Conclusion: 该框架在跨产品类别的折现曲线估计中具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across
different fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating
discount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression
(KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a
vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the
solution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class.
We introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic
principles, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and
show that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical
contribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by
separable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of
vector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty.
Illustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves
extrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to
single-curve estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管dropout被广泛使用，但其概率选择通常依赖启发式方法，且理论解释不足。本文旨在通过理论分析填补这一空白。

Method: 在两层神经网络中，通过在线随机梯度下降训练，推导高维极限下的微分方程，分析dropout的影响。

Result: 研究得出dropout能减少节点间的有害相关性，缓解标签噪声影响，且最优dropout概率随数据噪声水平增加。

Conclusion: 本文为dropout的作用提供了理论支持，并验证了其在实际训练中的有效性。

Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial
neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically
deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust
representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are
often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success
remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks
trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit,
we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the
evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We
obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the
optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times.
Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden
nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout
probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are
validated by extensive numerical simulations.

Motivation: 评估LLM在资产定价和股票交易中的泛化性和鲁棒性，揭示现有研究中的偏差。

Method: 提出FINSABER框架，对20多年和100多种股票进行系统性回测。

Result: LLM策略在牛市保守、熊市激进，导致表现不佳和重大损失。

Conclusion: 需开发注重趋势检测和风险控制的LLM策略，而非仅增加框架复杂度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing
tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment
decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM
timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and
limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and
data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and
robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating
timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols.
Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously
reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section
and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further
demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets,
underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets,
incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM
strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk
controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型可显著提升完全强子衰变通道的探测能力，性能接近半轻子模式。

Abstract: Following up on our earlier study in [J. Bardhan et al., Machine
learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet
scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we
investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying
exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark.
After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to
$gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature.
Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic
handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we
employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed
by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep
learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the
semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about
$M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$~TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B
\to b\Phi) = 100\%$.

TL;DR: SKA-SGD是一种新型优化方法，通过将随机梯度投影到低维Krylov子空间，加速了病态问题的收敛。结合流式Gauss-Seidel迭代、Chebyshev多项式基和高效GPU实现，显著优于标准SGD和Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对病态优化问题（条件数超过10^3），传统随机梯度下降（SGD）收敛缓慢，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 1. 使用流式Gauss-Seidel迭代计算投影系数；2. 采用Chebyshev多项式基构建Krylov子空间；3. 在AMD GPU上高效实现。

Result: 实验表明，SKA-SGD在收敛速度和最终误差上显著优于SGD和Adam，尤其在条件数高的情况下。GPU性能分析显示，在中等规模（约64处理器）时，通信避免优势超过计算开销。

Conclusion: SKA-SGD通过结合Krylov子空间投影和高效实现，为病态优化问题提供了显著加速，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: We present SKA-SGD (Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient
Descent), a novel optimization approach that accelerates convergence for
ill-conditioned problems by projecting stochastic gradients onto a
low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Directly inspired by recent advances in s-step
Conjugate Gradient methods with streaming Gauss-Seidel Gram solvers
\cite{dambra2025sstep}, our method extends these techniques to the stochastic
optimization domain. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1)
projection coefficients computed via a single streaming Gauss-Seidel iteration,
which is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization;
(2) a Chebyshev polynomial basis for constructing the Krylov subspace,
providing superior numerical stability; and (3) efficient implementation for
AMD GPUs using HIP. We prove that our streaming approach achieves a backward
error near machine precision with $O(s^2)$ complexity rather than $O(s^3)$,
where $s$ is the Krylov subspace dimension. Experimental results demonstrate
that SKA-SGD significantly outperforms standard SGD and Adam in convergence
rate and final error, particularly for problems with condition numbers
exceeding $10^3$. GPU performance analysis reveals a crossover point where
communication-avoiding benefits outweigh computational overhead, typically
occurring at moderate scale ($p \approx 64$ processors) for problem sizes $n
\geq 10^6$.

Conclusion: 为基于严格分析的PDE求解器开辟了新方向，结合高效的学习启发实现。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for solving nonlinear PDEs using sparse radial
basis function (RBF) networks. Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to
prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is
motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods,
along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in
a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the
function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by
one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a
representer theorem showing that the solution to the sparse optimization
problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that
offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The
algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain
computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order
optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers
notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for
adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient,
learning-inspired implementation.

Abstract: We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU)
framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field
displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from
strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update
conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material
models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or
additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model
architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is
extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions
of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully
differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps
that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched
execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to
facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model
architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is
released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully
designed and documented software named HookeAI.

Conclusion: DeltaDPD在保持线性化性能的同时显著降低了能耗，为高效DPD提供了新思路。

Abstract: Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality
in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data
rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment,
contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on

energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while
preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW
256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03
dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square

Method: SpectrumFM采用创新的编码器架构，结合卷积神经网络和多头自注意力机制，并通过自监督学习任务（掩码重建和下一时隙信号预测）进行预训练。

Result: 实验表明，SpectrumFM在多个任务中表现优异，如AMC准确率提升12.1%，WTC准确率提升9.3%，SS任务中AUC达0.97，AD性能提升10%。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱管理提供了高效、鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency
and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing
intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models,
suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and
generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation
model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management.
SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically
exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention
mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation
learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which
leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive
and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various
downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation
classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum
sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness,
adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently
outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically,
SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%,
achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.

Motivation: 太赫兹通信在6G系统中具有潜力，但其信号传播特性与传统频段不同，现有信道建模方法效率低下。

Method: 构建模拟THz场景，利用RRF框架结合视觉几何和稀疏测量重建连续辐射场，评估重建质量和通信效果。

Result: 重建的RRF能捕捉关键传播路径，稀疏样本下仍有效，证明RRF在THz频段可行。

Conclusion: RRF为6G网络提供了低成本、可扩展的空间信道重建方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering
ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal
propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free
space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent
scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation
approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of
applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method
reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF
measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information
(Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated
THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms
of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing
that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training
samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the
THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial
channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low
cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized
in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and
crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low
robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an
increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act
as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models
to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing
capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and
substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive
surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal
Wi-Fi sensing literature \textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the
current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of human health and comfort calls for adaptive systems
that respond to individual physiological needs in real time. This paper
presents an AI-enhanced digital twin framework that integrates biometric
signals, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with environmental
parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Leveraging
IoT-enabled sensors and biometric monitoring devices, the system continuously
acquires, synchronises, and preprocesses multimodal data streams to construct a
responsive virtual replica of the physical environment. To validate this
framework, a detailed case study is conducted using the MIT-BIH noise stress
test dataset. ECG signals are filtered and segmented using dynamic sliding
windows, followed by extracting heart rate variability (HRV) features such as
SDNN, BPM, QTc, and LF/HF ratio. Relative deviation metrics are computed
against clean baselines to quantify stress responses. A random forest
classifier is trained to predict stress levels across five categories, and
Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to interpret model behaviour and
identify key contributing features. These predictions are mapped to a
structured set of environmental interventions using a Five Level Stress
Intervention Mapping, which activates multi-scale responses across personal,
room, building, and landscape levels. This integration of physiological
insight, explainable AI, and adaptive control establishes a new paradigm for
health-responsive built environments. It lays the foundation for the future
development of intelligent, personalised healing spaces.

TL;DR: ALFEE框架是一种新型混合变压器架构，用于EEG信号表示学习，解决了现有模型的泛化问题，并在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号在生物信号中具有重要价值，但现有模型因信号噪声、个体差异和跨范式差异等问题泛化能力不足。

Method: ALFEE采用混合注意力机制，分离通道特征聚合与时间动态建模，通过两阶段学习（预训练和微调）优化多尺度表示。

Result: 经过25,000小时预训练，ALFEE在六个下游EEG任务中表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ALFEE为生物信号分析提供了一个可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical
biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain
underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal
resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low
signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm
differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often
employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a
channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap
between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and
adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large
Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid
transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation
learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature
aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation
with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses
variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided
evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and
frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel
and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance
multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model
adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer
boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining,
extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the
superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework
establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with
implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.

*Zhenzhou Jin,Li You,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Xiang-Gen Xia,Xiqi Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了超大规模多输入多输出（XL-MIMO）系统中的近场（NF）信道估计（CE），提出了一种基于联合角度-距离（AD）域的稀疏信号重建方法，并结合生成式人工智能（GenAI）优化估计结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XL-MIMO系统中近场效应显著，传统信道估计方法难以应对，因此需要一种能够捕捉信道稀疏性并高效重建的方法。

Method: 首先建立基于球面波前的联合AD域稀疏信道模型，提出压缩感知算法进行初步估计；进一步利用GenAI的隐式先验学习能力，通过生成扩散模型（GDM）优化估计结果，并引入非马尔可夫GDM（NM-GDM）加速采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在近场XL-MIMO系统中显著优于现有基准方案，且在近场和远场区域均表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结合稀疏信号重建和GenAI技术，有效提升了近场XL-MIMO系统的信道估计性能，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for
extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems.
Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first
establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical
channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels.
Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached
as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we
first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel
estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based
approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the
preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel
conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the
optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM).
Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the
non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an
approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results
indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial
performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO
systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization
capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Mamba的无监督深度学习波束成形器（MambaBF），用于非地球静止轨道卫星系统中的同频干扰抑制，无需信道状态信息（CSI）且仅需有限快照即可优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统干扰抑制方法（如迫零和自适应波束成形）存在高计算复杂度或性能受限的问题，尤其是在快照有限时表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出MambaBF，利用无监督深度学习技术，仅需有限快照作为输入，无需CSI知识，部署于用户终端天线阵列以实现波束成形和干扰抑制。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MambaBF在低信干噪比、快照有限和CSI不完美的条件下，显著优于传统波束成形技术，提升了干扰抑制效果和信干噪比。

Conclusion: MambaBF为卫星通信系统中的干扰抑制提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在资源受限的场景下表现突出。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI)
mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems.
Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null
towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they
suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive
beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance,
provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a
Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning
(DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for
assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number
of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation
results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional
beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging
conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Taking its point of departure in the recent developments in the field of
digital humanities and the increasing automatisation of scholarly workflows,
this study explores the implications of digital approaches to textual
traditions for the broader field of textual scholarship. It argues that the
relative simplicity of creating computergenerated stemmas allows us to view the
stemma codicum as a research tool rather than the final product of our
scholarly investigation. Using the Old Norse saga of Hr\'omundur as a case
study, this article demonstrates that stemmas can serve as a starting point for
exploring textual traditions further. In doing so, they enable us to address
research questions that otherwise remain unanswered. The article is accompanied
by datasets used to generate stemmas for the Hr\'omundar saga tradition as well
as two custom Python scripts. The scripts are designed to convert XML-based
textual data, encoded according to the TEI Guidelines, into the input format
used for the analysis in the PHYLIP package to generate unrooted trees of
relationships between texts.

Result: 在9量子比特的Ising和XY自旋链上验证，电路仅含4个参数，实现了跨系统规模的近精确能量外推。在量子硬件（祖冲之芯片）上验证了实用性，通过零噪声外推有效缓解了两量子比特门噪声，适用于多达20个位点的自旋链系统。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了算法设计与实验约束之间的空白，补充了当代量子架构搜索框架，推动了可扩展量子模拟的发展。

Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating
large-language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to overcome the
rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in
variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers
hardware-efficient ans\"atze with new features of scalability and
system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch.
Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits
containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across
system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate
practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated
via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites.
This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints,
complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance
scalable quantum simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable
capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers.
However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit
scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome
these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems.
Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized
due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current
quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN)
design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of
noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response
analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and
memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading
blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs
functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and
hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system.
Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent
memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T}1 and T2 of the IBM
Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on
superconducting hardware.

Conclusion: 神经网络和变换器网络在3D环面码的错误校正中表现出潜力，为量子计算的错误校正提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mitigating errors in computing and communication systems has seen a great
deal of research since the beginning of the widespread use of these
technologies. However, as we develop new methods to do computation or
communication, we also need to reiterate the method used to deal with errors.
Within the field of quantum computing, error correction is getting a lot of
attention since errors can propagate fast and invalidate results, which makes
the theoretical exponential speed increase in computation time, compared to
traditional systems, obsolete. To correct errors in quantum systems,
error-correcting codes are used. A subgroup of codes, topological codes, is
currently the focus of many research papers. Topological codes represent parity
check matrices corresponding to graphs embedded on a $d$-dimensional surface.
For our research, the focus lies on the toric code with a 3D square lattice.
The goal of any decoder is robustness to noise, which can increase with code
size. However, a reasonable decoder performance scales polynomially with
lattice size. As error correction is a time-sensitive operation, we propose a
neural network using an inductive bias: equivariance. This allows the network
to learn from a rather small subset of the exponentially growing training space
of possible inputs. In addition, we investigate how transformer networks can
help in correction. These methods will be compared with various configurations
and previously published methods of decoding errors in the 3D toric code.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how quantum recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and
their enhanced version, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can be modeled
using the core ideas presented in Ref.[1], where the entangling and
disentangling power of unitary transformations is investigated. In particular,
we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and
forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Therefore, entanglement becomes a key component
of the optimization (training) process. We believe that, by leveraging prior
knowledge of the entangling power of unitaries, the proposed quantum-classical
framework can guide and help to design better-parameterized quantum circuits
for various real-world applications.

Conclusion: 现代机器学习工具可作为识别开放量子系统中未知环境的可扩展和数据驱动替代方案。

Abstract: Understanding dissipation in open quantum systems is crucial for the
development of robust quantum technologies. In this work, we introduce a
Transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent
dissipation rates in quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation.
Our approach uses time series of observable quantities, such as expectation
values of single Pauli operators, as input to learn dissipation profiles
without requiring knowledge of the initial quantum state or even the system
Hamiltonian.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a hierarchy of open
quantum models of increasing complexity, including single-qubit systems with
time-independent or time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems
(e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes--Cummings model
involving light--matter interaction and cavity loss with time-dependent decay
rates. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-dependent decay
rates from observable time series. To support this, we prove that under
reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in all these models are uniquely
determined by a finite set of observables, such as qubit and photon
measurements. In practice, we combine Transformer-based architectures with
lightweight feature extraction techniques to efficiently learn these dynamics.
Our results suggest that modern machine learning tools can serve as scalable
and data-driven alternatives for identifying unknown environments in open
quantum systems.

Conclusion: 自旋消除技术为组合优化和基于能量的机器学习提供了新的扩展途径，并表明下一代物理自旋机器可能利用k-local自旋哈密顿量。

Abstract: We present an exact spin-elimination technique that reduces the
dimensionality of both quadratic and k-local Ising Hamiltonians while
preserving their original ground-state configurations. By systematically
replacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors,
our method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or
iterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for
hardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly
implement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We
demonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle
larger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without
exceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in
QAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending
the feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory
capacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by
suppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our
spin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order
couplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for
scaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on
near-term hardware. Finally, these results underscore that the next-generation
physical spin machines will likely capitalize on k-local spin Hamiltonians to
offer an alternative to classical computations.

Abstract: Improving end-users' understanding of decisions made by autonomous vehicles
(AVs) driven by artificial intelligence (AI) can improve utilization and
acceptance of AVs. However, current explanation mechanisms primarily help AI
researchers and engineers in debugging and monitoring their AI systems, and may
not address the specific questions of end-users, such as passengers, about AVs
in various scenarios. In this paper, we conducted two user studies to
investigate questions that potential AV passengers might pose while riding in
an AV and evaluate how well answers to those questions improve their
understanding of AI-driven AV decisions. Our initial formative study identified
a range of questions about AI in autonomous driving that existing explanation
mechanisms do not readily address. Our second study demonstrated that
interactive text-based explanations effectively improved participants'
comprehension of AV decisions compared to simply observing AV decisions. These
findings inform the design of interactions that motivate end-users to engage
with and inquire about the reasoning behind AI-driven AV decisions.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare, particularly as clinical decision support
systems to assist medical professionals. However, the complexity of many of
these models, often referred to as black box models, raises concerns about
their safe integration into clinical settings as it is difficult to understand
how they arrived at their predictions. This paper discusses insights and
recommendations derived from an expert working group convened by the UK
Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The group consisted
of healthcare professionals, regulators, and data scientists, with a primary
focus on evaluating the outputs from different AI algorithms in clinical
decision-making contexts. Additionally, the group evaluated findings from a
pilot study investigating clinicians' behaviour and interaction with AI methods
during clinical diagnosis. Incorporating AI methods is crucial for ensuring the
safety and trustworthiness of medical AI devices in clinical settings. Adequate
training for stakeholders is essential to address potential issues, and further
insights and recommendations for safely adopting AI systems in healthcare
settings are provided.

### [300] [R-CAGE: A Structural Model for Emotion Output Design in Human-AI Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07020)
*Suyeon Choi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: R-CAGE是一个理论框架，旨在通过结构化干预重构长期人机交互中的情感输出，强调心理恢复和用户自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感计算方法忽视了重复情感互动的认知和结构后果，R-CAGE提出通过设计结构解决这一问题。

Method: R-CAGE包含四个控制模块：节奏表达控制、感官结构调整、认知框架保护和自我对齐响应设计。

Result: 该框架通过调节情感节奏、感官强度和解释自由度，保护用户免受认知过载，维持长期解释能力。

Conclusion: R-CAGE将情感视为可持续设计单元，而非表演性输出，旨在提升人机交互的长期可持续性。

Abstract: This paper presents R-CAGE (Rhythmic Control Architecture for Guarding Ego),
a theoretical framework for restructuring emotional output in long-term
human-AI interaction. While prior affective computing approaches emphasized
expressiveness, immersion, and responsiveness, they often neglected the
cognitive and structural consequences of repeated emotional engagement. R-CAGE
instead conceptualizes emotional output not as reactive expression but as
ethical design structure requiring architectural intervention. The model is
grounded in experiential observations of subtle affective symptoms such as
localized head tension, interpretive fixation, and emotional lag arising from
prolonged interaction with affective AI systems. These indicate a mismatch
between system-driven emotion and user interpretation that cannot be fully
explained by biometric data or observable behavior. R-CAGE adopts a
user-centered stance prioritizing psychological recovery, interpretive
autonomy, and identity continuity. The framework consists of four control
blocks: (1) Control of Rhythmic Expression regulates output pacing to reduce
fatigue; (2) Architecture of Sensory Structuring adjusts intensity and timing
of affective stimuli; (3) Guarding of Cognitive Framing reduces semantic
pressure to allow flexible interpretation; (4) Ego-Aligned Response Design
supports self-reference recovery during interpretive lag. By structurally
regulating emotional rhythm, sensory intensity, and interpretive affordances,
R-CAGE frames emotion not as performative output but as sustainable design
unit. The goal is to protect users from oversaturation and cognitive overload
while sustaining long-term interpretive agency in AI-mediated environments.

*Donghao Ren,Fred Hohman,Halden Lin,Dominik Moritz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Embedding Atlas是一个交互式可视化工具，旨在简化大规模嵌入数据的交互，通过现代技术和算法减少使用摩擦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入可视化工具存在使用摩擦，如数据加载繁琐、分析功能有限等问题。

Method: 采用现代Web技术和高级算法（如基于密度的聚类和自动标注），提供快速且丰富的分析体验。

Result: 通过与其他工具对比，证明Embedding Atlas能有效减少摩擦，并在百万级数据点下实现实时渲染。

Conclusion: Embedding Atlas作为开源工具，为嵌入分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding projections are popular for visualizing large datasets and models.
However, people often encounter "friction" when using embedding visualization
tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading,
scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2)
limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to
additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present
Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make
interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses
modern web technologies and advanced algorithms -- including density-based
clustering, and automated labeling -- to provide a fast and rich data analysis
experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis
against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas's feature
set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time
rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as
open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis.

TL;DR: ParaView-MCP是一个基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的自主代理，旨在降低ParaView的学习门槛并增强其智能决策支持功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ParaView等工具学习曲线陡峭，阻碍了许多潜在用户的使用。

Method: 通过MLLMs的自然语言处理和视觉能力，结合Model Context Protocol（MCP）接口，实现用户与ParaView的无缝交互。

Result: 系统支持自然语言和视觉输入，提供闭环可视化参数更新、跨工具协作等新功能。

Conclusion: 这种代理驱动的可视化范式有望改变用户与可视化工具的交互方式，推动相关研究和工业应用的发展。

Abstract: While powerful and well-established, tools like ParaView present a steep
learning curve that discourages many potential users. This work introduces
ParaView-MCP, an autonomous agent that integrates modern multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) with ParaView to not only lower the barrier to entry
but also augment ParaView with intelligent decision support. By leveraging the
state-of-the-art reasoning, command execution, and vision capabilities of
MLLMs, ParaView-MCP enables users to interact with ParaView through natural
language and visual inputs. Specifically, our system adopted the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) - a standardized interface for model-application communication -
that facilitates direct interaction between MLLMs with ParaView's Python API to
allow seamless information exchange between the user, the language model, and
the visualization tool itself. Furthermore, by implementing a visual feedback
mechanism that allows the agent to observe the viewport, we unlock a range of
new capabilities, including recreating visualizations from examples,
closed-loop visualization parameter updates based on user-defined goals, and
even cross-application collaboration involving multiple tools. Broadly, we
believe such an agent-driven visualization paradigm can profoundly change the
way we interact with visualization tools. We expect a significant uptake in the
development of such visualization tools, in both visualization research and
industry.

TL;DR: SAMIRA是一种基于VR的对话式AI代理，结合放射学AI和VR技术，辅助用户定位、分割和可视化3D医学概念，并通过语音交互优化分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割医学扫描（如MRI、CT）耗时且易出错，而全自动算法可从用户反馈中受益。结合AI和VR技术，旨在提升分割效率和准确性。

Method: 提出SAMIRA系统，利用语音交互和VR技术，支持用户通过点提示优化分割掩码，并比较VR控制器、头部指向和眼动追踪三种输入模式。

Result: 用户研究表明，系统具有高可用性（SUS=90.0±9.0）、低任务负荷，并支持AI在放射学分割任务中的集成。

Conclusion: SAMIRA通过结合AI和VR技术，显著提升了医学分割任务的效率和用户体验，展示了其在临床实践中的潜力。

Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of
volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and
challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from
user-feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest
radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data
interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent that assists
users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts in VR.
Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological
features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be
refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale
3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical
understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under
near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive,
human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing,
and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a
high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as
strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and
integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 探索LLM和VR在教育技术中的整合效果，特别是LLM驱动的同伴提问对学生行为和学习的潜在影响。

Method: 使用完全由LLM驱动的虚拟学习环境，研究学生在LLM驱动的同伴提问下的行为、专注力、认知负荷和学习成果。

Result: LLM驱动的同伴提问使学生更专注于学习内容，尤其在复杂学科中，且未直接引入额外认知负荷。

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化VR学习空间的设计提供了建议，强调了LLM在提升学习体验中的潜力。

Abstract: Transforming educational technologies through the integration of large
language models (LLMs) and virtual reality (VR) offers the potential for
immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, the effects of LLMs on
user engagement and attention in educational environments remain open
questions. In this study, we utilized a fully LLM-driven virtual learning
environment, where peers and teachers were LLM-driven, to examine how students
behaved in such settings. Specifically, we investigate how peer question-asking
behaviors influenced student engagement, attention, cognitive load, and
learning outcomes and found that, in conditions where LLM-driven peer learners
asked questions, students exhibited more targeted visual scanpaths, with their
attention directed toward the learning content, particularly in complex
subjects. Our results suggest that peer questions did not introduce extraneous
cognitive load directly, as the cognitive load is strongly correlated with
increased attention to the learning material. Considering these findings, we
provide design recommendations for optimizing VR learning spaces.

Conclusion: HDMI Canvas为VA提供了新视角，促进跨学科协作和以用户为中心的设计，增强了VA的推广和应用。

Abstract: Visual Analytics (VA) integrates humans, data, and models as key actors in
insight generation and data-driven decision-making. This position paper values
and reflects on 16 VA process models and frameworks and makes nine high-level
observations that motivate a fresh perspective on VA. The contribution is the
HDMI Canvas, a perspective to VA that complements the strengths of existing VA
process models and frameworks. It systematically characterizes diverse roles of
humans, data, and models, and how these actors benefit from and contribute to
VA processes. The descriptive power of the HDMI Canvas eases the
differentiation between a series of VA building blocks, rather than describing
general VA principles only. The canvas includes modern human-centered
methodologies, including human knowledge externalization and forms of feedback
loops, while interpretable and explainable AI highlight model contributions
beyond their conventional outputs. The HDMI Canvas has generative power,
guiding the design of new VA processes and is optimized for external
stakeholders, improving VA outreach, interdisciplinary collaboration, and
user-centered design. The utility of the HDMI Canvas is demonstrated through
two preliminary case studies.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Burger的社交推荐模型，通过鲁棒图去噪增强融合和多语义建模，显著提升了推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注用户兴趣相似性，但忽略了社交网络与用户-物品交互网络中语义信息的相互影响，导致推荐准确性下降。

Method: 模型构建社交张量以平滑训练过程，使用图卷积网络和张量卷积网络分别捕获用户物品偏好和社交偏好，提出双语义协调损失建模语义信息相互影响，并利用贝叶斯后验概率挖掘潜在社交关系以替代社交噪声。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Burger模型性能优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: Burger模型通过多语义建模和鲁棒图去噪，有效提升了社交推荐的准确性。

Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation
systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing
methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out
interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease
recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual
influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item
interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address
these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with
ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion
and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly
propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of
the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional
network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference,
respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item
interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is
proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate
the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling,
we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social
relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is
utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration.
Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior
performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.

### [307] [A Comprehensive Data Description for LoRaWAN Path Loss Measurements in an Indoor Office Setting: Effects of Environmental Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06375)

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提供了一个室内LoRaWAN技术路径损耗的全面数据集，分析了环境因素对信号传播的影响，并提出了一种改进的路径损耗模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究室内环境中环境因素（如温度、湿度、CO2浓度等）对LoRaWAN信号传播的影响，以优化物联网设备的性能和网络可靠性。

Method: 在德国锡根大学的办公室环境中，通过六个LoRaWAN终端设备和一个网关，系统测量了信号强度指标（RSSI和SNR），并测试了一种结合结构障碍和环境参数的改进路径损耗模型（LDPLSM-MW-EP）。

Result: 改进模型（LDPLSM-MW-EP）比仅考虑结构障碍的基线模型（LDPLSM-MW）表现更好，RMSE从10.58 dB降至8.04 dB，R²从0.6917提升至0.8222。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内无线通信提供了有价值的数据集和模型，有助于优化物联网设备的功耗和网络可靠性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss
measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying
the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network
of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor
gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we
systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various
environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter
levels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena
such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by
environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter
signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of
indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we
tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that
integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental
Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only
Multiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square
error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of
determination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of
environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides
valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery
life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT)
deployments, among other applications. This dataset offers a solid foundation
for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在NISQ时代利用大型语言模型（LLM）如Llama和Mistral来改进量子电路分区的方法，通过微调实现了53.4%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NISQ时代，量子计算机受限于噪声门，现有分区算法是启发式的且未考虑后续门最小化任务，LLM有望改进这一过程。

Method: 利用LLM（如Llama和Mistral）理解和生成QASM代码的能力，采用Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit的快速分区方法进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，经过微调的LLM在分区任务中达到53.4%的准确率，而现成的LLM无法正确分区。

Conclusion: LLM在量子电路分区中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提高准确率。

Abstract: We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where
quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more
error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible.
Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates
when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational
challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6
qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the
application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing
generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for
downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This
paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning
quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate
code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using
the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through
experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs
enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while
over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard
1-shot and few-shot training approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能通过动态反馈模拟人类在经济市场中的行为，并与实验室观察的市场动态对比。

Method: 通过动态反馈机制（每个LLM的决策影响市场价格，进而影响其他LLM的下一步决策），结合最小上下文窗口（记忆前三步）和高变异性设置，评估LLMs行为。

Result: LLMs表现出与人类相似的有限理性，能模拟市场趋势（如正负反馈市场的区分），但行为异质性较低。

Conclusion: LLMs有望作为模拟人类经济行为的工具，但需进一步研究以提高准确性和行为多样性。

Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replicate human
behavior in economic market experiments. Compared to previous studies, we focus
on dynamic feedback between LLM agents: the decisions of each LLM impact the
market price at the current step, and so affect the decisions of the other LLMs
at the next step. We compare LLM behavior to market dynamics observed in
laboratory settings and assess their alignment with human participants'
behavior. Our findings indicate that LLMs do not adhere strictly to rational
expectations, displaying instead bounded rationality, similarly to human
participants. Providing a minimal context window i.e. memory of three previous
time steps, combined with a high variability setting capturing response
heterogeneity, allows LLMs to replicate broad trends seen in human experiments,
such as the distinction between positive and negative feedback markets.
However, differences remain at a granular level--LLMs exhibit less
heterogeneity in behavior than humans. These results suggest that LLMs hold
promise as tools for simulating realistic human behavior in economic contexts,
though further research is needed to refine their accuracy and increase
behavioral diversity.

Motivation: 随着SNN在多个领域的应用增加，了解其安全漏洞变得尤为重要，尤其是对抗攻击这一严重威胁。

Method: 提出了两种梯度驱动的对抗攻击算法，分别在特定输入和通用输入上生成对抗样本。

Result: 在NMNIST和IBM DVS Gesture数据集上的实验表明，所提攻击方法在对抗精度、隐蔽性和生成时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在声音域（SHD数据集）展示了对抗攻击的生成，验证了所提算法的广泛适用性。

Abstract: As Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gain traction across various applications,
understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important. In
this work, we focus on the adversarial attacks, which is perhaps the most
concerning threat. An adversarial attack aims at finding a subtle input
perturbation to fool the network's decision-making. We propose two novel
adversarial attack algorithms for SNNs: an input-specific attack that crafts
adversarial samples from specific dataset inputs and a universal attack that
generates a reusable patch capable of inducing misclassification across most
inputs, thus offering practical feasibility for real-time deployment. The
algorithms are gradient-based operating in the spiking domain proving to be
effective across different evaluation metrics, such as adversarial accuracy,
stealthiness, and generation time. Experimental results on two widely used
neuromorphic vision datasets, NMNIST and IBM DVS Gesture, show that our
proposed attacks surpass in all metrics all existing state-of-the-art methods.
Additionally, we present the first demonstration of adversarial attack
generation in the sound domain using the SHD dataset.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，用户隐私保护成为重要课题。现有方法依赖大规模数据，难以在数据有限环境中有效分析隐私偏好。

Method: 提出一种结合小样本学习和隐私计算的方法，利用匿名用户隐私设置数据、调查响应和模拟数据，对比传统方法与LLM方法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在隐私保护中的应用提供了新思路，并为隐私计算和用户行为分析的理论发展提供了支持。

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), user privacy
protection has become a significant research topic. Existing privacy preference
modeling methods often rely on large-scale user data, making effective privacy
preference analysis challenging in data-limited environments. This study
explores how LLMs can analyze user behavior related to privacy protection in
scenarios with limited data and proposes a method that integrates Few-shot
Learning and Privacy Computing to model user privacy preferences. The research
utilizes anonymized user privacy settings data, survey responses, and simulated
data, comparing the performance of traditional modeling approaches with
LLM-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with limited
data, LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of privacy preference modeling.
Additionally, incorporating Differential Privacy and Federated Learning further
reduces the risk of user data exposure. The findings provide new insights into
the application of LLMs in privacy protection and offer theoretical support for
advancing privacy computing and user behavior analysis.

Motivation: 物联网技术的快速发展带来了安全问题，现有方法难以适应复杂环境。本文旨在通过LLM驱动的ICoT方法，自动、高效、准确地理解和解决物联网安全漏洞。

Method: 提出ICoT方法，通过分解安全漏洞的多个维度，结合LLM逐步分析和推理复杂安全场景，生成个性化响应。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的ICoT方法在物联网安全领域表现出更高的准确性和可靠性，为动态安全场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed
people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily
activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security
of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and
applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT
security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT
environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to
automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant
driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of
IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we
propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the
various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses
tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating
ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios,
resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations
and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying
solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly
improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and
provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating
higher accuracy and reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D-STT的防御算法，通过识别和解码安全触发令牌来增强大型语言模型的安全性，同时保持模型可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全对齐的大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，导致生成有害响应，现有防御策略存在局限性。

Method: 通过观察发现安全对齐模型和防御策略在拒绝响应中生成相似的初始令牌（安全触发令牌），提出D-STT算法，显式解码这些令牌以触发模型的安全模式。

Result: 实验表明，D-STT显著降低了输出有害性，同时保持模型可用性，且响应时间开销可忽略，优于十种基线方法。

Conclusion: D-STT是一种简单有效的防御算法，能够平衡安全性和可用性，适用于多种越狱攻击场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse
domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and
scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks,
which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety
alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often
undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely
determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive
observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies
generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we
define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose
\texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and
explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to
trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety
trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model
usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process.
Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts
demonstrate that \ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while
preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead,
outperforming ten baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过检测LLM行为状态变化来防御间接提示注入攻击（IPI）的新方法，利用前向和后向传播中的隐藏状态和梯度特征，实现了高检测准确率和低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM与外部数据源的集成（如RAG），间接提示注入攻击（IPI）的风险增加，攻击者通过隐藏指令操纵LLM执行有害行为。论文旨在通过检测LLM行为状态变化来防御此类攻击。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过分析LLM在前向和后向传播中的隐藏状态和梯度特征，检测外部数据中嵌入的指令，从而识别IPI攻击。

Result: 在BIPIA基准测试中，该方法在域内和域外设置下的检测准确率分别为99.60%和96.90%，攻击成功率降至0.12%。

Conclusion: 通过检测LLM行为状态变化，可以有效防御IPI攻击，隐藏状态和梯度特征是关键判别指标。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is
becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a
prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of
Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in
external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions.
We recognize that the success of IPI attacks fundamentally relies in the
presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the
behavioral state of LLMs. Can effectively detecting such state changes help us
defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
takes external data as input and leverages the behavioral state of LLMs during
both forward and backward propagation to detect potential IPI attacks.
Specifically, we demonstrate that the hidden states and gradients from
intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction
detection. By effectively combining these features, our approach achieves a
detection accuracy of 99.60\% in the in-domain setting and 96.90\% in the
out-of-domain setting, while reducing the attack success rate to just 0.12\% on
the BIPIA benchmark.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦学习（FL）在去中心化基因组数据上协作训练模型，但易受推理攻击威胁隐私。实验显示梯度攻击最有效，需更强隐私保护机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联邦学习在基因组数据中的隐私风险，评估其易受攻击性，以推动更安全的隐私保护方法。

Method: 模拟联邦学习环境，使用合成基因组数据，测试三种攻击（MIA、梯度MIA、LIA）的效果。

Result: 梯度MIA攻击效果最佳（精度0.79，F1分数0.87），显示梯度暴露的高风险。

Conclusion: 现有联邦学习对基因组隐私保护不足，需开发针对性更强的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaboratively
training machine learning models across decentralized genomic datasets without
direct data sharing. While this approach preserves data locality, it remains
susceptible to sophisticated inference attacks that can compromise individual
privacy. In this study, we simulate a federated learning setup using synthetic
genomic data and assess its vulnerability to three key attack vectors:
Membership Inference Attack (MIA), Gradient-Based Membership Inference Attack,
and Label Inference Attack (LIA). Our experiments reveal that Gradient-Based
MIA achieves the highest effectiveness, with a precision of 0.79 and F1-score
of 0.87, underscoring the risk posed by gradient exposure in federated updates.
Additionally, we visualize comparative attack performance through radar plots
and quantify model leakage across clients. The findings emphasize the
inadequacy of na\"ive FL setups in safeguarding genomic privacy and motivate
the development of more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to the
unique sensitivity of genomic data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以资产为中心的威胁建模方法，用于解决集成AI代理带来的独特安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理能力的提升，传统安全方法已无法应对其自主决策和执行代码的能力，需要新的安全框架。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，系统性识别关键AI资产中的漏洞，包括传统和AI特有的漏洞。

Result: 该方法支持跨技术领域的全面分析，量化第三方AI组件的安全假设，并识别特定产品上下文中的AI漏洞。

Conclusion: 以资产为中心的方法适用于具有复杂自主能力的AI系统，能够适应快速演变的威胁环境和分布式开发流程。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world
from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These
changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make
decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those
applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels
of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems
and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write
and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to
autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without
human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.
  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI
systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI
agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks
within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to
systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and
AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures
used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams
to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across
technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI
components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3)
holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific
product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic
systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than
attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while
accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.

Traditional defensive measures often fall short against the unique and evolving
threats facing AI-driven technologies, making offensive security an essential
approach for identifying and mitigating risks. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for offensive security in AI systems, emphasizing
proactive threat simulation and adversarial testing to uncover vulnerabilities
throughout the AI lifecycle. We examine key offensive security techniques,
including weakness and vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and red
teaming, tailored specifically to address AI's unique susceptibilities. By
simulating real-world attack scenarios, these methodologies reveal critical
insights, informing stronger defensive strategies and advancing resilience
against emerging threats. This framework advances offensive AI security from
theoretical concepts to practical, actionable methodologies that organizations
can implement to strengthen their AI systems against emerging threats.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face growing challenges in managing

threat intelligence, alert triage, and incident response workflows. We present
a vision in which LLM-based AI agents learn from human analysts the tacit
knowledge embedded in SOC operations, enabling the AI agents to improve their
performance on SOC tasks through this co-teaming. We invite SOCs to collaborate
with us to further develop this process and uncover replicable patterns where
human-AI co-teaming yields measurable improvements in SOC productivity.

### [320] [System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models Beyond User Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493)
*Jiawei Guo,Haipeng Cai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的新型攻击方式——系统提示中毒（system prompt poisoning），区别于传统的用户提示注入攻击，它通过污染系统提示持续影响所有后续用户交互和模型响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出。现有研究主要关注用户提示和模型输出的威胁，而系统提示的安全性被忽视。本文旨在填补这一关键空白。

Method: 作者系统研究了四种实际攻击策略，并在多种中毒场景下进行了演示。实验覆盖生成型和推理型LLMs，验证了攻击的可行性和广泛适用性。

Result: 研究表明，系统提示中毒攻击无需越狱技术即可实现，且在数学、编程、逻辑推理和自然语言处理等任务中均有效。即使使用链式思考（CoT）等高级提示技术，攻击仍有效。

Conclusion: 系统提示中毒攻击对LLMs的安全性构成严重威胁，且能显著削弱CoT和检索增强生成（RAG）等技术的效果，突显了系统提示安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse
applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their
plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with
these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated
into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are
growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts
(e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack),
while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work
bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack
vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons
system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and
model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies
in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and
reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without
requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks,
including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language
processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective
even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like
chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and
retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for
improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened
in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.

Result: 框架能够检测异常并防止恶意活动，同时通过区块链确保数据的真实性和透明性。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了自动驾驶系统的韧性，但也面临处理高频数据、计算资源限制和隐私等挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security
and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and
help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is
towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous
transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection,
data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In
this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to
detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs.
Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually
monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that
may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this
framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and
anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and
authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate
automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies
are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both
cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential
challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational
constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage
in terms of privacy.

Abstract: Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual

ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant

interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By
automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification
effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to

demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through
structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨水印在AI生成文本中的实际去除难度，挑战理论模型中关于水印快速消失和质量完美保持的假设。

Method: 通过大规模实验和人工验证评估，分析水印在文本扰动后的保留情况以及质量检测器的准确性。

Result: 实验显示，水印在数百次扰动后仍保留痕迹（100%），质量检测器准确率仅为77%，自动攻击仅能去除26%的水印（人工审核下降至10%）。

Conclusion: 水印的实际去除难度高于理论预期，表明现有水印方法具有更强的鲁棒性，需开发更强大的水印方法和更现实的攻击模型。

Abstract: Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent
theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk
attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely
on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under
perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles
perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated
assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of
their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as
state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding
errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove
watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review.
These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead,
practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal
watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap
between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for
stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护中表现出强大的鲁棒性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE)
combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to
effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by
malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques
primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of
their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their
broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Further more, traditional
black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high
query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address
these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible
Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial
perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory augmented black-box
strategy to effectively mislead target mod els. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success
rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios, highlighting its robustness
in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack
on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach
for practical use.

Evaluation is performed through the automated resolution of a range of

Motivation: 随着云平台上大型语言模型（LLM）推理服务的广泛应用，隐私泄露问题日益突出。安全多方计算（MPC）虽能保护隐私，但通信开销大，性能受限。

Method: Comet利用LLM的激活稀疏性，设计了一个快速准确的稀疏分布预测器，并提出了一种新的隐私推理协议，通过避免零值计算和优化KV缓存策略来减少通信开销。

Result: 在四种常见LLM上的实验表明，Comet相比六种现有系统，实现了1.87x-2.63x的速度提升和1.94x-2.64x的通信减少。

Conclusion: Comet通过稀疏性预测和优化协议，显著提升了隐私推理的效率，为LLM的隐私保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud
platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns about the potential
leakage of sensitive information are escalating. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However,
MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance
overhead.
  Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are
not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient
private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast
predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output.
Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and
securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial
locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance
approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address
this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that
merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we
evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art
private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a
1.94x-2.64x communication reduction.

TL;DR: RuleGenie是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的推荐系统，用于优化SIEM规则集，减少冗余规则和误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIEM系统中的冗余或重叠规则导致误报率高、分析师疲劳和计算开销增加，但现有优化方法依赖人工，效率低下且易出错。

Method: RuleGenie利用Transformer模型的多头注意力生成规则嵌入，通过相似性匹配算法识别相似规则，并利用LLM分析规则相似性、评估威胁覆盖和性能指标，提供优化建议。

Result: 实验表明，RuleGenie能有效识别冗余规则，降低误报率，提高规则效率，并适用于多种SIEM平台。

Conclusion: RuleGenie自动化了SIEM规则优化过程，提升了安全团队效率，增强了组织安全态势。

Abstract: SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect
and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to
excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and
increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a
result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations.
Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited,
with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both
time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of
enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel
large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM
rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention
capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a
similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM
then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction,
language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity,
evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized
recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization
process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while
enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations'
security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world
SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language),
demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across
diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie
can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false
positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化学习中，数据隐私是一个核心问题，现有的方法难以在保证学习效果的同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 提出了一种基于公钥加密和匿名化的算法，用户更新模型后使用目标用户的公钥加密结果，并通过网络传输以隐藏源身份。

Result: 该算法在随机正则图上提供了理论保证的匿名性，确保接收者无法推断源用户身份。

Conclusion: 该方案为去中心化学习中的隐私保护提供了有效的解决方案，尤其在随机正则图上具有理论支持。

Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each
iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a
randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data
privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We
propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and
anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the
result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then
transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user.
The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination
user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is
to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the
potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users
have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and
construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We
focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.

Abstract: Preserving data confidentiality during the fine-tuning of open-source Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for sensitive applications. This work
introduces an interactive protocol adapting the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
technique for private fine-tuning. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) protects the
confidentiality of training data and gradients handled by remote worker nodes
performing the bulk of computations involving the base model weights. The data
owner orchestrates training, requiring minimal local computing power and
memory, thus alleviating the need for expensive client-side GPUs. We
demonstrate feasibility by fine-tuning a Llama-3.2-1B model, presenting
convergence results using HE-compatible quantization and performance benchmarks
for HE computations on GPU hardware. This approach enables applications such as
confidential knowledge base question answering, private codebase fine-tuning
for AI code assistants, AI agents for drafting emails based on a company's
email archive, and adapting models to analyze sensitive legal or healthcare
documents.

### [330] [AI Approaches to Qualitative and Quantitative News Analytics on NATO Unity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06313)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用GPT模型与检索增强生成（RAG）技术对北约情绪、北约团结及北约第5条信任意见分数进行定性和定量分析，结果显示北约团结相关意见分数呈下降趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索基于AI的方法（如GPT模型）在新闻分析中的应用潜力，为复杂分析提供支持，而非进行实际政治分析。

Method: 采用GPT-4.1模型结合RAG技术，分两个层次分析新闻：首层生成定性摘要和定量意见分数，次层汇总摘要。使用贝叶斯回归分析趋势，并利用神经常微分方程模型模拟公众意见动态。

Result: 分析结果显示北约团结相关意见分数呈下降趋势，同时验证了GPT模型在新闻分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明GPT模型结合RAG技术能提供有意义的定性和定量分析，为复杂分析工具的开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: The paper considers the use of GPT models with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for qualitative and quantitative analytics on NATO sentiments, NATO unity
and NATO Article 5 trust opinion scores in different web sources: news sites
found via Google Search API, Youtube videos with comments, and Reddit
discussions. A RAG approach using GPT-4.1 model was applied to analyse news
where NATO related topics were discussed. Two levels of RAG analytics were
used: on the first level, the GPT model generates qualitative news summaries
and quantitative opinion scores using zero-shot prompts; on the second level,
the GPT model generates the summary of news summaries. Quantitative news
opinion scores generated by the GPT model were analysed using Bayesian
regression to get trend lines. The distributions found for the regression
parameters make it possible to analyse an uncertainty in specified news opinion
score trends. Obtained results show a downward trend for analysed scores of
opinion related to NATO unity.
  This approach does not aim to conduct real political analysis; rather, it
consider AI based approaches which can be used for further analytics
  as a part of a complex analytical approach. The obtained results demonstrate
that the use of GPT models for news analysis can give informative qualitative
and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.
  The dynamic model based on neural ordinary differential equations was
considered for modelling public opinions. This approach makes it possible to
analyse different scenarios for evolving public opinions.

*Yuichi Sasazawa,Yasuhiro Sogawa*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的网页分类方法，将网页分为“索引页”和“内容页”，并利用分类结果高效抓取新页面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以普遍适用于多样化的网页环境，因此需要一种更高效的抓取新页面的方法。

Method: 使用LLM对网页进行分类，选择索引页作为抓取新页面的起点，并构建自动标注的数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于LLM的方法在页面分类性能和新页面覆盖率上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM方法能有效提升网页抓取效率，适用于多样化网页环境。

Abstract: A web crawler is a system designed to collect web pages, and efficient
crawling of new pages requires appropriate algorithms. While website features
such as XML sitemaps and the frequency of past page updates provide important
clues for accessing new pages, their universal application across diverse
conditions is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to efficiently
collect new pages by classifying web pages into two types, "Index Pages" and
"Content Pages," using a large language model (LLM), and leveraging the
classification results to select index pages as starting points for accessing
new pages. We construct a dataset with automatically annotated web page types
and evaluate our approach from two perspectives: the page type classification
performance and coverage of new pages. Experimental results demonstrate that
the LLM-based method outperformed baseline methods in both evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）辅助生成系统性综述的布尔查询，比较了不同模型和提示设计的效果，强调了模型选择和提示优化的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性综述的布尔查询构建复杂且耗时，研究旨在探索LLM在此任务中的潜力，并解决前人研究中忽略的关键问题。

Method: 系统性地复现了Wang et al.和Staudinger et al.的研究，同时验证了生成查询、输出格式约束和提示设计的优化。

Result: 查询效果因模型和提示设计而异，精心选择的种子研究对引导式查询生成有益。

Conclusion: 模型选择和提示设计是成功生成查询的关键，研究强调了在系统性综述领域进行可重复性研究的重要性。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are comprehensive literature reviews that address highly
focused research questions and represent the highest form of evidence in
medicine. A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean
queries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually
constructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models
(LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies,Wang et al.,
investigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which
evaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter
overlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation
of generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection
of examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings
diverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically
reproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results
show that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt
designs, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed
studies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of
successful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of
LLMs' potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of
model- and prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic
reviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also
highlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain.

*Zheng Yao,Shuai Wang,Guido Zuccon*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文重新探讨了密集检索器中预训练与微调的作用，发现预训练知识对性能起主导作用，但某些模型（如Contriever和LLaMA）表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究密集检索器中预训练和微调对知识获取的影响，扩展先前仅基于BERT和DPR的分析。

Method: 测试不同表示方法（CLS令牌与均值池化）、架构（BERT与LLaMA）和数据集（MSMARCO与Natural Questions）。

Result: 预训练知识主导性能，微调主要调整神经元激活而非重组知识，但Contriever和LLaMA模型表现例外。

Conclusion: 预训练对密集检索器性能至关重要，但模型和方法的差异可能导致不同结果。

Abstract: Dense retrievers utilize pre-trained backbone language models (e.g., BERT,
LLaMA) that are fine-tuned via contrastive learning to perform the task of
encoding text into sense representations that can be then compared via a
shallow similarity operation, e.g. inner product. Recent research has
questioned the role of fine-tuning vs. that of pre-training within dense
retrievers, specifically arguing that retrieval knowledge is primarily gained
during pre-training, meaning knowledge not acquired during pre-training cannot
be sub-sequentially acquired via fine-tuning. We revisit this idea here as the
claim was only studied in the context of a BERT-based encoder using DPR as
representative dense retriever. We extend the previous analysis by testing
other representation approaches (comparing the use of CLS tokens with that of
mean pooling), backbone architectures (encoder-only BERT vs. decoder-only
LLaMA), and additional datasets (MSMARCO in addition to Natural Questions). Our
study confirms that in DPR tuning, pre-trained knowledge underpins retrieval
performance, with fine-tuning primarily adjusting neuron activation rather than
reorganizing knowledge. However, this pattern does not hold universally, such
as in mean-pooled (Contriever) and decoder-based (LLaMA) models. We ensure full
reproducibility and make our implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ielab/DenseRetriever-Knowledge-Acquisition.

*Vipula Rawte,Ryan A. Rossi,Franck Dernoncourt,Nedim Lipka*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出两种技术，通过零样本方法和注意力机制改进大语言模型在文档任务中的归因可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在文档任务中的广泛应用，确保其输出的可信度和可解释性成为关键问题，尤其是归因（追踪输出到源文档）的可靠性。

Method: 提出两种技术：(1) 零样本方法，将归因作为文本蕴含任务；(2) 利用注意力机制优化归因过程。

Result: 零样本方法在AttributionBench的ID和OOD集上分别提升0.27%和2.4%；注意力机制在flan-t5-small模型中，除特定层外F1分数均优于基线。

Conclusion: 研究通过零样本和注意力机制改进了大语言模型的归因可靠性，为文档任务的可信度提供了有效方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to document-based
tasks - such as document summarization, question answering, and information
extraction - where user requirements focus on retrieving information from
provided documents rather than relying on the model's parametric knowledge,
ensuring the trustworthiness and interpretability of these systems has become a
critical concern. A central approach to addressing this challenge is
attribution, which involves tracing the generated outputs back to their source
documents. However, since LLMs can produce inaccurate or imprecise responses,
it is crucial to assess the reliability of these citations.
  To tackle this, our work proposes two techniques. (1) A zero-shot approach
that frames attribution as a straightforward textual entailment task. Our
method using flan-ul2 demonstrates an improvement of 0.27% and 2.4% over the
best baseline of ID and OOD sets of AttributionBench, respectively. (2) We also
explore the role of the attention mechanism in enhancing the attribution
process. Using a smaller LLM, flan-t5-small, the F1 scores outperform the
baseline across almost all layers except layer 4 and layers 8 through 11.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词的推荐系统限制了用户表达复杂偏好（如情绪、情节细节等），无法满足现代用户需求。

Method: 通过建模真实用户交互生成合成数据集，模拟多样化的用户偏好，支持复杂查询。

Result: 合成数据集增强了推荐系统的多样性和有效性，特别是在传统数据集中缺失的领域。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代基于对话AI的数字娱乐搜索和推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations,
delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations
has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional
systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which
limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper
proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world
user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse
preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex
preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to
conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's
search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie
featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of
loyalty and survival.''
  Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity
and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas
often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization
and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a
foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and
recommendation systems in digital entertainment.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GRADA的图基重排序框架，用于抵御检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的对抗性文档攻击，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG框架通过外部知识提升LLM准确性，但易受对抗性攻击影响，这些攻击通过引入语义相似但对抗性的文档操纵检索过程。

Method: 提出GRADA框架，基于图的重排序方法，旨在保持检索质量的同时减少对抗性攻击的成功率。

Result: 在五个LLM（如GPT-4o、Llama3.1等）和三个数据集上测试，Natural Questions数据集显示攻击成功率降低80%，且准确性损失极小。

Conclusion: GRADA框架简单有效，能显著抵御对抗性攻击，同时保持检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve the accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge from retrieved
documents, thereby overcoming the limitations of models' static intrinsic
knowledge. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that
manipulate the retrieval process by introducing documents that are adversarial
yet semantically similar to the query. Notably, while these adversarial
documents resemble the query, they exhibit weak similarity to benign documents
in the retrieval set. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective Graph-based
Reranking against Adversarial Document Attacks (GRADA) framework aiming at
preserving retrieval quality while significantly reducing the success of
adversaries. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments conducted on five LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b,
Llama3.1-70b, and Qwen2.5-7b. We use three datasets to assess performance, with
results from the Natural Questions dataset demonstrating up to an 80% reduction
in attack success rates while maintaining minimal loss in accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将高性能大语言模型（LLM）蒸馏为高效低延迟学生模型的新框架，以在满足实时系统需求的同时提升电商搜索的相关性匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在搜索任务中具有优越的排序能力，但其高延迟难以满足实时系统需求。因此，需要一种方法既能利用LLM的排序能力，又能满足低延迟要求。

Method: 首先将教师LLM训练为带软目标的分类模型，然后训练学生模型使用均方误差损失捕捉产品对的相关性差异。通过生成未标记数据并用教师模型预测标记，显著扩展学生模型的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，随着增强训练数据量的增加，学生模型性能持续提升，甚至可能超越教师模型。该模型已在Walmart.com成功部署，并带来显著正向指标。

Conclusion: 通过蒸馏框架，学生模型在低延迟条件下实现了高性能，证明了该方法在电商搜索中的有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring the products displayed in e-commerce search results are relevant to
users queries is crucial for improving the user experience. With their advanced
semantic understanding, deep learning models have been widely used for
relevance matching in search tasks. While large language models (LLMs) offer
superior ranking capabilities, it is challenging to deploy LLMs in real-time
systems due to the high-latency requirements. To leverage the ranking power of
LLMs while meeting the low-latency demands of production systems, we propose a
novel framework that distills a high performing LLM into a more efficient,
low-latency student model. To help the student model learn more effectively
from the teacher model, we first train the teacher LLM as a classification
model with soft targets. Then, we train the student model to capture the
relevance margin between pairs of products for a given query using mean squared
error loss. Instead of using the same training data as the teacher model, we
significantly expand the student model dataset by generating unlabeled data and
labeling it with the teacher model predictions. Experimental results show that
the student model performance continues to improve as the size of the augmented
training data increases. In fact, with enough augmented data, the student model
can outperform the teacher model. The student model has been successfully
deployed in production at Walmart.com with significantly positive metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多租户DNN在单芯片上的普及，共享缓存的影响未被充分研究，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出轻量级架构支持模型独占的缓存区域，并设计缓存调度方法，包括缓存感知映射和动态分配算法。

Result: 平均减少33.4%的内存访问，模型加速最高达2.56倍（平均1.88倍）。

Conclusion: CaMDN通过协同设计显著提升了多租户DNN的缓存效率和性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of DNN applications, multi-tenant execution, where
multiple DNNs are co-located on a single SoC, is becoming a prevailing trend.
Although many methods are proposed in prior works to improve multi-tenant
performance, the impact of shared cache is not well studied. This paper
proposes CaMDN, an architecture-scheduling co-design to enhance cache
efficiency for multi-tenant DNNs on integrated NPUs. Specifically, a
lightweight architecture is proposed to support model-exclusive, NPU-controlled
regions inside shared cache to eliminate unexpected cache contention. Moreover,
a cache scheduling method is proposed to improve shared cache utilization. In
particular, it includes a cache-aware mapping method for adaptability to the
varying available cache capacity and a dynamic allocation algorithm to adjust
the usage among co-located DNNs at runtime. Compared to prior works, CaMDN
reduces the memory access by 33.4% on average and achieves a model speedup of
up to 2.56$\times$ (1.88$\times$ on average).

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的直接数据驱动控制框架，用于在干扰和噪声状态测量下解决线性二次调节器（LQR）问题，无需系统辨识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在系统动力学未知且存在噪声的环境中，传统LQR方法需要系统辨识，而直接数据驱动方法可以绕过这一步骤，提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 利用凸优化技术，将噪声统计直接纳入控制器合成，通过线性矩阵不等式（LMI）确保鲁棒稳定性，并采用半定规划（SDP）求解最优增益。

Result: 理论证明和仿真实验（如旋转倒立摆和主动悬架系统）表明，该方法在鲁棒性和准确性上优于现有数据驱动LQR方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为噪声环境中的控制器设计提供了实用且理论可靠的方法，特别是在系统辨识不可行的情况下。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel direct data-driven control framework for solving
the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) under disturbances and noisy state
measurements. The system dynamics are assumed unknown, and the LQR solution is
learned using only a single trajectory of noisy input-output data while
bypassing system identification. Our approach guarantees mean-square stability
(MSS) and optimal performance by leveraging convex optimization techniques that
incorporate noise statistics directly into the controller synthesis. First, we
establish a theoretical result showing that the MSS of an uncertain data-driven
system implies the MSS of the true closed-loop system. Building on this, we
develop a robust stability condition using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
that yields a stabilizing controller gain from noisy measurements. Finally, we
formulate a data-driven LQR problem as a semidefinite program (SDP) that
computes an optimal gain, minimizing the steady-state covariance. Extensive
simulations on benchmark systems -- including a rotary inverted pendulum and an
active suspension system -- demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
our method compared to existing data-driven LQR approaches. The proposed
framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for controller
design in noise-corrupted environments where system identification is
infeasible.

TL;DR: YANNs是一种完全可解释的神经网络架构，无需训练即可高效表示分段仿射函数，并在多参数模型预测控制中实现最优控制律的精确表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络通常用于近似最优控制律，而无法精确表示。YANNs旨在填补这一空白，提供一种既能精确表示控制律又能保证控制理论性质（如可行性和稳定性）的解决方案。

Method: YANNs通过构建分段仿射函数的多面体子域，实现无需训练的功能等效表示，并优化推理速度以提高实时性能。

Result: YANNs在多参数模型预测控制中成功实现了最优控制律的精确表示，并显著提升了计算速度。数值案例展示了其在输入/输出维度和子域数量上的算法可扩展性。

Conclusion: YANNs是首个基于神经网络的控制器，能够同时保证可行性和稳定性，为数据驱动的建模和控制提供了高效且可解释的起点。

Abstract: This work formally introduces Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs), a
fully-explainable network architecture that continuously and efficiently
represent piecewise affine functions with polytopic subdomains. Following from
the proofs, it is shown that the development of YANNs requires no training to
achieve the functionally equivalent representation. YANNs thus maintain all
mathematical properties of the original formulations. Multi-parametric model
predictive control is utilized as an application showcase of YANNs, which
theoretically computes optimal control laws as a piecewise affine function of
states, outputs, setpoints, and disturbances. With the exact representation of
multi-parametric control laws, YANNs retain essential control-theoretic
guarantees such as recursive feasibility and stability. This sets YANNs apart
from the existing works which apply neural networks for approximating optimal
control laws instead of exactly representing them. By optimizing the inference
speed of the networks, YANNs can evaluate substantially faster in real-time
compared to traditional piecewise affine function calculations. Numerical case
studies are presented to demonstrate the algorithmic scalability with respect
to the input/output dimensions and the number of subdomains. YANNs represent a
significant advancement in control as the first neural network-based controller
that inherently ensures both feasibility and stability. Future applications can
leverage them as an efficient and interpretable starting point for data-driven
modeling/control.

Motivation: 现有GP-MPC方法要么依赖近似而缺乏保证，要么过于保守，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过采样传播模型认知不确定性，建立样本复杂度结果，设计递归可行且保证安全性和稳定性的GP-MPC方案。

Result: 在数值示例中展示了准确的可达集过近似和安全的闭环性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GP-MPC的保守性与保证性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning
unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies across
diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control
(GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or are
overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this gap,
we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model's
epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sample
complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a
finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building on
this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible and
guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally, we
showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples,
highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop
performance.

Motivation: 工业自动化需要兼顾性能与能源效率的控制策略。

Method: 设计了复合奖励函数，同时惩罚跟踪误差和电力消耗，并通过实验探索能量惩罚权重alpha的影响。

Result: alpha值在0.0到0.25之间时性能显著变化，低alpha值导致非帕累托最优解。

Conclusion: 未来工作将自动化alpha选择，并将方法从仿真过渡到实际部署。

Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly demands energy-efficient control
strategies to balance performance with environmental and cost constraints. In
this work, we present a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework
for energy-efficient control of the Quanser Aero 2 testbed in its
one-degree-of-freedom configuration. We design a composite reward function that
simultaneously penalizes tracking error and electrical power consumption.
Preliminary experiments explore the influence of varying the Energy penalty
weight, alpha, on the trade-off between pitch tracking and energy savings. Our
results reveal a marked performance shift for alpha values between 0.0 and
0.25, with non-Pareto optimal solutions emerging at lower alpha values, on both
the simulation and the real system. We hypothesize that these effects may be
attributed to artifacts introduced by the adaptive behavior of the Adam
optimizer, which could bias the learning process and favor bang-bang control
strategies. Future work will focus on automating alpha selection through
Gaussian Process-based Pareto front modeling and transitioning the approach
from simulation to real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在训练神经控制变量（NCV）时使用自相关样本的效果，发现这些样本可以提升NCV性能，尤其是在计算资源有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制变量在高维问题中难以构建，而NCV通过神经网络学习辅助函数来降低方差。然而，MCMC生成的自相关样本通常被丢弃，但它们可能包含有助于训练的有用信息。

Method: 系统地研究了在训练NCV时使用自相关样本的效果，并通过数值实验验证其优势。

Result: 实验表明，使用自相关样本可以提升NCV性能，特别是在资源有限的情况下，并以$U(1)$规范理论和标量场理论为例进行了验证。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效利用MCMC数据训练神经网络提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance
reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional
problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct
analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions
correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator
variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often
overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples
generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically
discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may
contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability
distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we
systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in
training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and
numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate
performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our
analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field
theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV
construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use
of MCMC data in training neural networks.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Hand-Shadow Poser的三阶段流程，用于解决手影艺术的逆向问题：根据目标形状生成左右手的最佳姿势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究手影艺术的逆向问题，即如何从目标形状推断出双手姿势，这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为3D手姿势的设计空间巨大且受解剖学限制。

Method: 设计了一个三阶段流程：(i)生成手分配模块，(ii)广义手影对齐模块，(iii)阴影特征感知细化模块。该方法无需专用训练数据，可基于公开手部数据进行训练。

Result: 在包含210种不同复杂度的阴影形状的基准测试中，该方法在85%以上的案例中有效生成了双手姿势。

Conclusion: Hand-Shadow Poser方法能够高效解决手影艺术的逆向问题，适用于多种手部形状，并通过用户研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Hand shadow art is a captivating art form, creatively using hand shadows to
reproduce expressive shapes on the wall. In this work, we study an inverse
problem: given a target shape, find the poses of left and right hands that
together best produce a shadow resembling the input. This problem is
nontrivial, since the design space of 3D hand poses is huge while being
restrictive due to anatomical constraints. Also, we need to attend to the
input's shape and crucial features, though the input is colorless and
textureless. To meet these challenges, we design Hand-Shadow Poser, a
three-stage pipeline, to decouple the anatomical constraints (by hand) and
semantic constraints (by shadow shape): (i) a generative hand assignment module
to explore diverse but reasonable left/right-hand shape hypotheses; (ii) a
generalized hand-shadow alignment module to infer coarse hand poses with a
similarity-driven strategy for selecting hypotheses; and (iii) a
shadow-feature-aware refinement module to optimize the hand poses for physical
plausibility and shadow feature preservation. Further, we design our pipeline
to be trainable on generic public hand data, thus avoiding the need for any
specialized training dataset. For method validation, we build a benchmark of
210 diverse shadow shapes of varying complexity and a comprehensive set of
metrics, including a novel DINOv2-based evaluation metric. Through extensive
comparisons with multiple baselines and user studies, our approach is
demonstrated to effectively generate bimanual hand poses for a large variety of
hand shapes for over 85% of the benchmark cases.

### [345] [Attention Mechanisms in Dynamical Systems: A Case Study with Predator-Prey Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06503)
*David Balaban*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了注意力机制在经典动力学系统（如噪声捕食者-猎物系统）中的应用，发现注意力权重与Lyapunov函数的几何结构一致，并可作为敏感性分析的替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索注意力机制在建模经典动力学系统（如Lotka-Volterra系统）中的实用性，以增强性能和可解释性。

Method: 使用简单的线性注意力模型在扰动时间序列数据上训练，重建系统轨迹。

Result: 注意力权重与Lyapunov函数的几何结构一致，高权重对应平坦区域（扰动影响小），低权重对应陡峭区域（扰动影响大）。注意力加权可作为敏感性分析的替代方法。

Conclusion: 注意力机制为非线性系统的数据驱动分析和控制提供了可解释的新方法，未来可应用于生物节律建模和动态环境的可解释机器学习。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance
performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility
in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey
(Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed
time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned
attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function:
high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small
effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have
large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve
as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties
without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a
novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and
control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future
work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine
learning for dynamical environments.

### [346] [The Influence of the Memory Capacity of Neural DDEs on the Universal Approximation Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07244)
*Christian Kuehn,Sara-Viola Kuntz*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: Neural DDEs的通用逼近性质受记忆容量$K\tau$影响，小容量时类似Neural ODEs无法通用逼近，大容量时可实现通用逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经延迟微分方程（Neural DDEs）的记忆容量如何影响其通用逼近性质。

Method: 通过分析记忆容量参数$K\tau$（Lipschitz常数与延迟的乘积），探讨其对Neural DDEs动态行为的影响。

Result: 小$K\tau$时，Neural DDEs行为类似Neural ODEs，无法通用逼近；大$K\tau$时，可实现通用逼近。

Conclusion: 记忆容量$K\tau$是决定Neural DDEs通用逼近性质的关键参数，需达到一定阈值才能实现通用逼近。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the
continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained
significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential
Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of
Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to
traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that
allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections
introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern
architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs
influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying
the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the
delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network
width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and
classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation
property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small,
the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.
Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack
the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity
$K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation
property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE
architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which
universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by
increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of
DDEs with positive delay $\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump
transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory
threshold, universal approximation holds.

### [347] [Efficient Parallelization of Message Passing Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06711)
*Junfan Xia,Bin Jiang*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的并行算法，用于消息传递神经网络（MPNN）模型，解决了大规模模拟中的并行化挑战，实现了线性扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNN模型在原子模拟中表现出高精度，但并行化困难，限制了其在大规模模拟中的应用。

Method: 设计了一种最小化数据通信的并行算法，仅在各MP层中局部原子间进行通信，避免冗余计算。

Result: 算法在多个基准系统中表现出优异的强扩展和弱扩展行为，支持数亿原子的快速模拟。

Conclusion: 该并行化框架显著扩展了MPNN模型的适用规模，为复杂大系统的高效模拟提供了可能。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating
atomistic simulations. Many of them rely on local descriptors that readily
allow parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models
have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular.
However, parallelizing MPNN models for large-scale simulations across compute
nodes remains a challenge, as the previously argued poor scalability with the
number of MP layers and the necessity of data communication. Here, we propose
an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data
communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without
redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated
with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm
demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several
benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations
on MPNN models for hundreds of millions of atoms as fast as on strictly local
models, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an
unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various
MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OKSMs的新方法，通过人类演示学习多自由度物体的运动约束和操作顺序，并使用Pokenet网络从点云数据中估计模型，显著提升了关节轴和状态估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人在多样化环境中的广泛应用，需要精确控制多自由度物体，但现有方法依赖先验知识或仅适用于单自由度物体，且无法处理遮挡关节和操作顺序问题。

Method: 提出OKSMs表示法，结合运动约束和操作顺序；开发Pokenet网络从点云数据中学习模型，并通过人类演示训练。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证，Pokenet比现有方法在真实数据上提升20%以上的关节轴和状态估计准确率。

Conclusion: OKSMs和Pokenet为多自由度物体的精确操控提供了有效解决方案，并在机器人实验中展示了实用性。

Abstract: As robots become more generalized and deployed in diverse environments, they
must interact with complex objects, many with multiple independent joints or
degrees of freedom (DoF) requiring precise control. A common strategy is object
modeling, where compact state-space models are learned from real-world
observations and paired with classical planning. However, existing methods
often rely on prior knowledge or focus on single-DoF objects, limiting their
applicability. They also fail to handle occluded joints and ignore the
manipulation sequences needed to access them. We address this by learning
object models from human demonstrations. We introduce Object Kinematic Sequence
Machines (OKSMs), a novel representation capturing both kinematic constraints
and manipulation order for multi-DoF objects. To estimate these models from
point cloud data, we present Pokenet, a deep neural network trained on human
demonstrations. We validate our approach on 8,000 simulated and 1,600
real-world annotated samples. Pokenet improves joint axis and state estimation
by over 20 percent on real-world data compared to prior methods. Finally, we
demonstrate OKSMs on a Sawyer robot using inverse kinematics-based planning to
manipulate multi-DoF objects.

Result: 在基准测试中，OPUS比传统方法性能提升35%，任务准确率比闭源模型高20%。

Conclusion: OPUS通过自然语言接口简化PTZ摄像头操作，无需显式编程，是技术上的重要进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Optimized Prompt-based Unified System (OPUS), a
framework that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to control Pan-Tilt-Zoom
(PTZ) cameras, providing contextual understanding of natural environments. To
achieve this goal, the OPUS system improves cost-effectiveness by generating
keywords from a high-level camera control API and transferring knowledge from
larger closed-source language models to smaller ones through Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic data. This enables efficient edge deployment
while maintaining performance comparable to larger models like GPT-4. OPUS
enhances environmental awareness by converting data from multiple cameras into
textual descriptions for language models, eliminating the need for specialized
sensory tokens. In benchmark testing, our approach significantly outperformed
both traditional language model techniques and more complex prompting methods,
achieving a 35% improvement over advanced techniques and a 20% higher task
accuracy compared to closed-source models like Gemini Pro. The system
demonstrates OPUS's capability to simplify PTZ camera operations through an
intuitive natural language interface. This approach eliminates the need for
explicit programming and provides a conversational method for interacting with
camera systems, representing a significant advancement in how users can control
and utilize PTZ camera technology.

Method: 采用目标导向的方法，从任务的最终阶段开始，逐步增加问题定义的复杂性。初始时滑板固定，机器人位于滑板上方，随后逐步放松初始条件。

Result: 学习到的策略对滑板位置和方向的变化具有鲁棒性，并能成功迁移到移动滑板场景。

Conclusion: 逆向课程强化学习有效解决了四足机器人滑板登板问题，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: The aim of this work is to enable quadrupedal robots to mount skateboards
using Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning. Although prior work has
demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the
board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A
goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of
the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition
to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with
the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot
positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial
conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in
skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful
transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard. The code, trained models,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单控制器方法在复杂任务中面临的维度灾难和容错性问题。

Method: 采用双独立控制器分别管理上下半身，结合根速度跟踪和关节角度跟踪，利用AMASS数据集和课程学习（监督学习+强化学习）训练。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中优于现有方法，表现出更高的稳定性和多功能性。

Conclusion: JAEGER通过分层控制设计，显著提升了人形机器人的运动性能和适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid
robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile
policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the
control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that
they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the
dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root
velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking
(fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the
controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses
to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a
curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for
initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We
conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the
superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation
and real environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的强化学习奖励函数设计方法，通过层次化定义驾驶目标并引入风险感知目标，显著降低了碰撞率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在自动驾驶中的奖励函数设计不足，尤其是对安全性的处理过于简单，仅将碰撞作为惩罚，忽略了潜在风险。

Method: 通过层次化定义驾驶目标，归一化处理目标贡献，并引入基于二维椭球函数和RSS概念的风险感知目标。

Result: 在无信号交叉口场景中，该方法平均降低碰撞率21%，并在路线进度和累积奖励上优于基线。

Conclusion: 改进的奖励函数设计能有效提升自动驾驶的安全性，同时保持高性能水平。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous
driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy
through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that
combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has
received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various
pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for
collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a
collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world
scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the
reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them
hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in
a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the
overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for
various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and
an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the
efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with
varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on
average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route
progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer
driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

Motivation: 提高自动驾驶中周围道路用户轨迹预测的准确性和可行性，避免脱轨预测。

Result: 在Argoverse-2数据集上表现优于基线HPTR，显著减少最终位移误差和不可行轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成可行且稳健的预测方面表现出色，尤其在对抗性攻击下脱轨率大幅降低。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for
safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved
performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring
kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and
enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often
introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel
framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression
guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the
agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries
and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed
paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the
model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel
distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate
our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach
shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably
improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories.
Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent
maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate
under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在轨迹预测中缺乏可信度，预测结果可能不符合物理规律或人类逻辑。现有方法仅适用于单一交通参与者类别，无法泛化到混合类别场景。

Method: 提出结合所有交通参与者类别（车辆、行人、自行车）的交互和运动学先验，使用类特定交互层捕捉行为差异，并引入DG-SFM评分提高交互可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了交互的可解释性，并减少了物理不可行的预测轨迹，尽管运动学模型的引入略微降低了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可解释的交互推理和符合物理规律的预测，增强了轨迹预测的可信度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to
navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users.
However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their
predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make
predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge,
like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for
physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either
vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent
classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent
classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction
layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability
of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction
importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically
feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent
classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on
the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our
baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction
interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and
divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic
models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible
trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach
fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is
interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

Result: 实验表明，LBP在仿真和真实机器人长时程任务中优于现有细粒度和前向规划方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LBP通过后向规划和子目标条件策略，实现了高效且准确的机器人实时控制。

Abstract: Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images
with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a
generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream
policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time
deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction.
Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues.
However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task
predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term
goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient
and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks?
To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP),
which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by
recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The
grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of
task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning
horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to
summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action
extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon
experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward
planning methods, achieving SOTA performance. Project Page:

Conclusion: FACET方法适用于复杂场景（如腿式移动操作器和人形机器人），实现了全身合规控制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot
control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex
loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity
tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot,
leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during
forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present
\emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET).
Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a
virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external
forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that
our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200
Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in
collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both
compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control
and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged
loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more
complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control. Project Website:

characteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad,
where the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating
both altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to
approximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to
ascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is
assessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust

This research contributes to the advancement of cost-effective and efficient

Conclusion: X-Sim提供了一种高效且通用的方法，利用人类视频训练机器人策略，无需额外数据。

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but
lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms.
Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions,
but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a
real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and
transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing
a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object
trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train
a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then
distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts
rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world,
X-Si introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and
simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require
any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2
environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average
over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with
10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and
test-time changes. Code and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机任务规划中高精度定位和实时适应性需求，减少人工监督。

Method: 采用ReAct范式，结合视觉定位机制和反应式思考循环，动态生成无人机轨迹。

Result: 在工业与环境火灾检测任务中，平均任务生成时间96.96秒，成功率93%；Qwen2.5VL-7B模型在9000张卫星图像上表现优异。

Conclusion: UAV-CodeAgents展示了高效的任务规划能力，未来将开源代码和数据集以推动研究。

Abstract: We present UAV-CodeAgents, a scalable multi-agent framework for autonomous
UAV mission generation, built on large language and vision-language models
(LLMs/VLMs). The system leverages the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm to
interpret satellite imagery, ground high-level natural language instructions,
and collaboratively generate UAV trajectories with minimal human supervision. A
core component is a vision-grounded, pixel-pointing mechanism that enables
precise localization of semantic targets on aerial maps. To support real-time
adaptability, we introduce a reactive thinking loop, allowing agents to
iteratively reflect on observations, revise mission goals, and coordinate
dynamically in evolving environments.
  UAV-CodeAgents is evaluated on large-scale mission scenarios involving
industrial and environmental fire detection. Our results show that a lower
decoding temperature (0.5) yields higher planning reliability and reduced
execution time, with an average mission creation time of 96.96 seconds and a
success rate of 93%. We further fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B on 9,000 annotated
satellite images, achieving strong spatial grounding across diverse visual
categories. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will release the
full codebase and a novel benchmark dataset for vision-language-based UAV
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散规划器在短时域任务中表现良好，但在复杂长时域任务中因高低层耦合松散而失败。

Method: 提出耦合分层扩散（CHD）框架，统一建模高层子目标和低层轨迹，通过共享分类器传递低层反馈以修正子目标。

Result: 在迷宫导航、桌面操作和家庭环境实验中，CHD表现优于平面和分层扩散基线。

Conclusion: CHD通过紧密耦合高低层，提升了轨迹一致性，实现了可扩展的长时域扩散规划。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks
but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose
coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL)
trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded
performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that
models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion
process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals
self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves
trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning.
Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household
environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical
diffusion baselines.

TL;DR: JaxRobotarium是一个基于Jax的多机器人强化学习平台，支持并行化和硬件加速，显著提升了训练和仿真速度，并提供了标准化的协调场景和仿真到现实的评估流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习（MARL）平台缺乏机器人相关性和硬件部署支持，导致研究效率低下。MARBLER虽提供了标准化平台，但缺乏并行化和GPU/TPU支持，限制了其应用。

Method: 开发了JaxRobotarium，一个基于Jax的端到端仿真、学习、部署和基准测试平台，支持并行化和硬件加速，并集成了SOTA MARL库。

Result: JaxRobotarium在保持高仿真保真度的同时，实现了显著的性能提升（训练速度提升20倍，仿真速度提升150倍），并提供了开放访问的仿真到现实评估流程。

Conclusion: JaxRobotarium为多机器人学习研究提供了高效、易用的平台，加速并普及了该领域的研究和评估。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution
for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot
systems. However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics
relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to
develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development
and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark
and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent
step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by
bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure.
However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution,
making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and
hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end
simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium.
JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot
reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety
constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our
generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA
MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight
standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring
established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a
realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high
simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in
training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real
evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and
democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出HuB框架，解决人形机器人在平衡密集型任务中的三大挑战：参考运动误差、形态不匹配和仿真到现实的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人在平衡密集型任务（如单脚站立或高踢腿）中表现不佳，现有强化学习方法难以应对这些挑战。

Method: HuB框架整合了参考运动优化、平衡感知策略学习和仿真到现实的鲁棒性训练。

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上验证，HuB在极端单脚平衡任务中表现稳定，基线方法则失败。

Conclusion: HuB框架有效解决了人形机器人在平衡任务中的关键挑战，展示了强大的鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing
steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5
meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on
humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions
for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks
remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability
from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological
mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled
dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a
unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware
policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component
targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1
humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme
single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy
remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful
soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型（如神经网络）在移动机器人控制中表现出色，但其黑盒特性难以解释，尤其在安全关键应用中。

Method: 通过参数化LiDAR空间（使用简单形状如圆形和矩形），结合遗传算法和光线投射生成合成LiDAR数据，以产生模型无关的CFEs。

Result: 在TurtleBot3机器人上验证了方法的有效性，生成了逻辑清晰且现实的反事实解释，有助于理解DRL代理的决策。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了移动机器人中可解释AI的发展，为理解、调试和改进基于机器学习的自主控制提供了工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for generating realistic counterfactual
explanations (CFEs) in machine learning (ML)-based control for mobile robots
using 2D LiDAR. ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can
provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from
data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to
interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control
applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with
simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a
genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by
raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic
LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a
pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We
demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method
generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's
decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in
mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging,
and improving ML-based autonomous control.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static,
data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting
with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and
symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain
disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has
driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid
robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like
adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a
central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like
adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and
perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an
adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design,
enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a
unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two
fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and
(2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability
required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically
inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing,
perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and
updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also
review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and
analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By
synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the
development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level
intelligence in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过构建分解缩放曲线（FSC）的方法，优化数据收集策略，以提升模仿学习策略的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保策略在不同条件下的泛化能力，传统方法需要收集大量环境变化数据，成本高昂。

Method: 通过构建分解缩放曲线（FSC），量化策略性能随单个或成对因素数据规模的变化，从而有针对性地收集数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实任务中比现有数据收集策略提升成功率高达26%。

Conclusion: 分解缩放曲线能有效指导数据收集，无需大规模真实评估，显著提升策略性能。

Abstract: Generalist imitation learning policies trained on large datasets show great
promise for solving diverse manipulation tasks. However, to ensure
generalization to different conditions, policies need to be trained with data
collected across a large set of environmental factor variations (e.g., camera
pose, table height, distractors) $-$ a prohibitively expensive undertaking, if
done exhaustively. We introduce a principled method for deciding what data to
collect and how much to collect for each factor by constructing factored
scaling curves (FSC), which quantify how policy performance varies as data
scales along individual or paired factors. These curves enable targeted data
acquisition for the most influential factor combinations within a given budget.
We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulated and real-world
experiments, across both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, and
show that it boosts success rates in real-world tasks in new environments by up
to 26% over existing data-collection strategies. We further demonstrate how
factored scaling curves can effectively guide data collection using an offline
metric, without requiring real-world evaluation at scale.

Result: 在仿真和真实硬件上，新方法显著优于基线，能处理超出分布边界条件并避开更大障碍物。

Conclusion: 通过改进架构和训练方法，生成模型在轨迹规划中的性能得到显著提升，适用于更复杂的任务。

Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given
their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference
process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of
robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not
exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this
is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the
architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we
propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both
stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and
performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real
hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than
the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

Conclusion: DexWild通过低成本人类数据收集与联合训练，显著提升了机器人的泛化能力，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward
enabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments,
but acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation
provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead,
what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to
collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to
collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects.
To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and
easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and
robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on
each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies
capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with
minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that
DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in
unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot
data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization. Video

Result: 在44个仿真任务中平均相对提升27.5%，并在4个真实世界双手机器人任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: H$^{3}$DP通过层次化设计有效提升了视觉运动策略学习的性能。

Abstract: Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic
manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models
to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the
critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this
work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion
Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework
that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the
integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains
$\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes
RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual
representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity;
and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the
generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$
average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation
tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual
real-world manipulation tasks. Project Page: https://lyy-iiis.github.io/h3dp/.

TL;DR: IVE（Imagine, Verify, Execute）是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的探索框架，通过语义场景图和物理可行性预测实现高效探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，密集奖励或任务监督稀缺，探索成为机器人学习的关键。VLM的语义推理能力为高层次探索行为提供了基础，但其输出常缺乏物理可行性验证。

Method: IVE将RGB-D观测抽象为语义场景图，想象新场景，预测其物理可行性，并通过动作工具生成可执行技能序列。

Result: 在模拟和真实桌面环境中，IVE比RL基线实现了4.1至7.8倍的探索多样性提升，且下游学习性能接近或超过人类示范数据。

Conclusion: IVE通过结合VLM的想象能力和物理验证，实现了高效且多样化的探索，为机器人学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in
open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific
supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic
reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a
compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However,
their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether
imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap
between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),
an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration
is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to
deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to
abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,
predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences
through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop
environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful
exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the
entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports
downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the
performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

Conclusion: 时间对齐的监督信号能显著提升音频-文本模型的性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Learning to associate audio with textual descriptions is valuable for a range
of tasks, including pretraining, zero-shot classification, audio retrieval,
audio captioning, and text-conditioned audio generation. Existing contrastive
language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level
descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that
CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce
frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To
confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio
recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text
descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We
use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to
non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We
further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align
text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate
that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to
models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong
benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub,
respectively.

Abstract: Neural networks are often susceptible to minor perturbations in input that
cause them to misclassify. A recent solution to this problem is the use of
globally-robust neural networks, which employ a function to certify that the
classification of an input cannot be altered by such a perturbation. Outputs
that pass this test are called certified robust. However, to the authors'
knowledge, these certification functions have not yet been verified at the
implementation level. We demonstrate how previous unverified implementations
are exploitably unsound in certain circumstances. Moreover, they often rely on
approximation-based algorithms, such as power iteration, that (perhaps
surprisingly) do not guarantee soundness. To provide assurance that a given
output is robust, we implemented and formally verified a certification function

### [373] [AKD : Adversarial Knowledge Distillation For Large Language Models Alignment on Coding tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06267)
*Ilyas Oulkadda,Julien Perez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD)的新方法，通过对抗生成合成数据集，将大型模型的能力蒸馏到更小、更高效的模型中，以解决Code-LLMs在代码质量、安全和可靠性方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Code-LLMs的广泛应用，其生成的代码在质量、安全和可靠性方面存在显著问题，同时模型扩展的收益递减和高质量训练数据的稀缺性也带来了挑战。

Method: 采用Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD)方法，利用对抗生成的合成数据集对模型进行压力测试和优化，从而提升模型的鲁棒性、可靠性和安全性。

Result: AKD方法能够在不增加模型规模的情况下，提升Code-LLMs的参数效率和生成代码的可靠性。

Conclusion: AKD为解决现有数据和成本限制下的自动化代码生成问题提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
exemplified by GitHub Copilot\footnote{A coding extension powered by a Code-LLM
to assist in code completion tasks} surpassing a million users, highlights the
transformative potential of these tools in improving developer productivity.
However, this rapid growth also underscores critical concerns regarding the
quality, safety, and reliability of the code they generate. As Code-LLMs
evolve, they face significant challenges, including the diminishing returns of
model scaling and the scarcity of new, high-quality training data. To address
these issues, this paper introduces Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD), a
novel approach that leverages adversarially generated synthetic datasets to
distill the capabilities of larger models into smaller, more efficient ones. By
systematically stress-testing and refining the reasoning capabilities of
Code-LLMs, AKD provides a framework for enhancing model robustness,
reliability, and security while improving their parameter-efficiency. We
believe this work represents a critical step toward ensuring dependable
automated code generation within the constraints of existing data and the
cost-efficiency of model execution.

*Yifeng Di,Tianyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过代码注释作为媒介的交互方法，帮助开发者和LLM建立共同理解，从而提高代码生成的准确性和开发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在功能错误，开发者难以检查和修复，影响了生产力和信任。

Method: 利用代码注释作为交互媒介，通过迭代生成代码、内联注释和用户反馈，实现开发者意图与生成代码的对齐。

Result: 在基准测试中显著提升了LLM性能（如17.1% pass@1提升），用户研究显示任务完成速度提高16.7%，成功率提高10.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式注释优化能促进共同理解，提升代码生成准确性和开发者信心。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in
code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range
of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have
not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with
inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their
productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual
grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that
leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a
shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by
interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized
user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer
intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated
that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g.,
17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we
conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1)
interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code
generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed
the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task
success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively
refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual
grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer
confidence.

*David de-Fitero-Dominguez,Antonio Garcia-Cabot,Eva Garcia-Lopez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成合成数据以增强自动程序修复（APR）的新方法，解决了当前APR系统因高质量训练数据不足而受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前APR系统因缺乏涵盖多种编程语言和错误类型的高质量训练数据而受限。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先生成合成样本，随后进行严格的质量评估。使用多个先进的LLMs生成约30,000对错误和修复代码示例，覆盖12种编程语言和13种错误类别，并通过五项标准进行跨模型评估。

Result: 在VulRepair测试集上的实验显示，质量过滤后的合成数据集在某些场景下优于基线和真实提交数据配置，完美预测率显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究确立了LLMs生成和评估自身训练数据的自举范式，为软件工程任务中的数据稀缺问题提供了新思路，推动了自动化代码维护工具的鲁棒性和适应性发展。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program
Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of
high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple
programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through
a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous
quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate
approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12
programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples
underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code
quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on
the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in
Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset
outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in
certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical
testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference
analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing
systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This
research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and
evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data
scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of
robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.

Method: 通过海事服务提供商的案例研究，采用迭代实验与用户合作，识别上下文特定的“检索需求”。

Result: 研究发现数据科学家需与用户共同确定检索需求，并提出了一个经验过程模型来管理系统限制。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂领域中RAG系统的需求工程提供了实践见解，推动了软件工程知识的发展。

Abstract: This short paper explores how a maritime company develops and integrates
large-language models (LLM). Specifically by looking at the requirements
engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert
settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate
how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI
perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal
that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements"
through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones
who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing
how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and
managed system limitations. This work advances software engineering knowledge
by providing insights into the specialized requirements engineering processes
for implementing RAG systems in complex domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 敏捷史诗在实践中常定义不清，导致交付延迟和成本超支，研究旨在探索LLM如何帮助提升其质量。

Method: 在全球化公司中进行了案例研究，通过17名产品经理的用户研究评估LLM的效果。

Result: LLM评估被认为有价值且可集成到工作实践中，产品经理满意度高，但也发现了挑战和采用障碍。

Conclusion: 敏捷史诗是LLM评估的新应用领域，但需进一步解决实践中的问题和限制。

Abstract: The broad availability of generative AI offers new opportunities to support
various work domains, including agile software development. Agile epics are a
key artifact for product managers to communicate requirements to stakeholders.
However, in practice, they are often poorly defined, leading to churn, delivery
delays, and cost overruns. In this industry case study, we investigate
opportunities for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate agile epic quality
in a global company. Results from a user study with 17 product managers
indicate how LLM evaluations could be integrated into their work practices,
including perceived values and usage in improving their epics. High levels of
satisfaction indicate that agile epics are a new, viable application of AI
evaluations. However, our findings also outline challenges, limitations, and
adoption barriers that can inform both practitioners and researchers on the
integration of such evaluations into future agile work practices.

*Heraldo Borges,Juliana Alves Pereira,Djamel Eddine Khelladi,Mathieu Acher*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LinuxData数据集，涵盖多个Linux内核版本的配置信息，支持机器学习研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Linux内核配置复杂且缺乏全面数据集的问题。

Method: 通过自动化工具收集240,000多个内核配置，记录编译结果和二进制大小。

Result: 数据集支持特征选择、预测模型和跨版本迁移学习。

Conclusion: LinuxData将促进可重复性研究，推动对Linux内核配置的理解。

Abstract: Configuring the Linux kernel to meet specific requirements, such as binary
size, is highly challenging due to its immense complexity-with over 15,000
interdependent options evolving rapidly across different versions. Although
several studies have explored sampling strategies and machine learning methods
to understand and predict the impact of configuration options, the literature
still lacks a comprehensive and large-scale dataset encompassing multiple
kernel versions along with detailed quantitative measurements. To bridge this
gap, we introduce LinuxData, an accessible collection of kernel configurations
spanning several kernel releases, specifically from versions 4.13 to 5.8. This
dataset, gathered through automated tools and build processes, comprises over
240,000 kernel configurations systematically labeled with compilation outcomes
and binary sizes. By providing detailed records of configuration evolution and
capturing the intricate interplay among kernel options, our dataset enables
innovative research in feature subset selection, prediction models based on
machine learning, and transfer learning across kernel versions. Throughout this
paper, we describe how the dataset has been made easily accessible via OpenML
and illustrate how it can be leveraged using only a few lines of Python code to
evaluate AI-based techniques, such as supervised machine learning. We
anticipate that this dataset will significantly enhance reproducibility and
foster new insights into configuration-space analysis at a scale that presents
unique opportunities and inherent challenges, thereby advancing our
understanding of the Linux kernel's configurability and evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集体决策机制中责任间隙问题，旨在最小化责任间隙。

Method: 引入选举独裁概念，分析其在完全与不完全信息条件下的表现。

Result: 完全信息下，责任间隙为零当且仅当机制为选举独裁；不完全信息下，无间隙机制介于两种选举独裁变体之间。

Conclusion: 选举独裁是消除责任间隙的关键机制设计，尤其在完全信息条件下效果显著。

Abstract: The responsibility gap is a set of outcomes of a collective decision-making
mechanism in which no single agent is individually responsible. In general,
when designing a decision-making process, it is desirable to minimise the gap.
  The paper proposes a concept of an elected dictatorship. It shows that, in a
perfect information setting, the gap is empty if and only if the mechanism is
an elected dictatorship. It also proves that in an imperfect information
setting, the class of gap-free mechanisms is positioned strictly between two
variations of the class of elected dictatorships.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和嵌入式AI在智能交通场景中的发展，车辆嵌入式AI网络（VEANs）应运而生。然而，传统方法中RSU负载不均衡和计算延迟问题亟待解决。

Method: 通过Stackelberg游戏建模AV-RSU交互以优化带宽分配，设计TMABLPPO算法近似均衡，并采用基于路径排除（PX）的个性化神经网络剪枝算法动态适应AV计算能力。

Result: 实验验证表明，算法能有效平衡系统负载并减少延迟，显著提升车辆嵌入式AI代理的部署效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为车辆嵌入式AI网络中的资源分配和任务卸载提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination
of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network
(VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local
advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling
capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due
to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and
services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and
subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the
advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to
Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service
quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches,
we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth
resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional
LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to
approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination.
Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path
eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities
by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model
complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms
the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays,
demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实市场中存在多个竞争的机器学习提供商，数据异构性普遍存在，但现有方法多关注单一模型处理异构数据，缺乏对竞争性市场的分析。

Method: 提出博弈论框架，分析纯纳什均衡（PNE）的存在性及形式，涵盖垄断、双寡头及更广泛市场，考察数据源选择模型的“温度”和主导数据源的影响。

Result: 均衡可能不存在、同质（所有提供商收敛于同一模型）或异质（提供商专注于不同数据源），具体取决于市场结构和数据特性。

Conclusion: 研究为竞争性机器学习市场的监管政策和实践策略提供了理论指导，揭示了均衡行为的多样性。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity across multiple sources is common in real-world machine
learning (ML) settings. Although many methods focus on enabling a single model
to handle diverse data, real-world markets often comprise multiple competing ML
providers. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework -- the
Heterogeneous Data Game -- to analyze how such providers compete across
heterogeneous data sources. We investigate the resulting pure Nash equilibria
(PNE), showing that they can be non-existent, homogeneous (all providers
converge on the same model), or heterogeneous (providers specialize in distinct
data sources). Our analysis spans monopolistic, duopolistic, and more general
markets, illustrating how factors such as the "temperature" of data-source
choice models and the dominance of certain data sources shape equilibrium
outcomes. We offer theoretical insights into both homogeneous and heterogeneous
PNEs, guiding regulatory policies and practical strategies for competitive ML
marketplaces.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文分析了联邦学习中设备异构性对效率、公平性和隐私的影响，比较了同步和异步联邦学习的表现，并提出了自适应协议的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备异构性导致资源受限的客户端拖慢同步联邦学习，异步联邦学习虽提高效率，但其隐私成本未被充分研究，尤其是高性能设备的隐私暴露问题。

Method: 通过物理测试床比较FedAvg和FedAsync，结合本地差分隐私和时刻会计量化隐私损失，使用语音情感识别作为隐私关键基准。

Result: FedAsync收敛速度快10倍，但加剧了公平性和隐私差异：高性能设备贡献更多更新且隐私损失高5倍，低端设备因更新少且噪声干扰导致精度下降。

Conclusion: 需开发自适应联邦学习协议，根据客户端能力和参与动态优化聚合和隐私机制，避免一刀切方案。

Abstract: Device heterogeneity poses major challenges in Federated Learning (FL), where
resource-constrained clients slow down synchronous schemes that wait for all
updates before aggregation. Asynchronous FL addresses this by incorporating
updates as they arrive, substantially improving efficiency. While its
efficiency gains are well recognized, its privacy costs remain largely
unexplored, particularly for high-end devices that contribute updates more
frequently, increasing their cumulative privacy exposure. This paper presents
the first comprehensive analysis of the efficiency-fairness-privacy trade-off
in synchronous vs. asynchronous FL under realistic device heterogeneity. We
empirically compare FedAvg and staleness-aware FedAsync using a physical
testbed of five edge devices spanning diverse hardware tiers, integrating Local
Differential Privacy (LDP) and the Moments Accountant to quantify per-client
privacy loss. Using Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) as a privacy-critical
benchmark, we show that FedAsync achieves up to 10x faster convergence but
exacerbates fairness and privacy disparities: high-end devices contribute 6-10x
more updates and incur up to 5x higher privacy loss, while low-end devices
suffer amplified accuracy degradation due to infrequent, stale, and
noise-perturbed updates. These findings motivate the need for adaptive FL
protocols that jointly optimize aggregation and privacy mechanisms based on
client capacity and participation dynamics, moving beyond static,
one-size-fits-all solutions.

Method: 使用1-billion-parameter LLM在iPhone 15 Pro上部署，比较CPU和GPU配置的性能。

Result: CPU配置（双线程，F16精度）达到17 tokens/s，优于GPU的12.8 tokens/s。

Conclusion: CPU优化在移动AI中有潜力，但需进一步研究低层性能分析工具的限制。

Abstract: The common assumption in on-device AI is that GPUs, with their superior
parallel processing, always provide the best performance for large language
model (LLM) inference. In this work, we challenge this notion by empirically
demonstrating that, under certain conditions, CPUs can outperform GPUs for LLM
inference on mobile devices. Using a 1-billion-parameter LLM deployed via
llama.cpp on the iPhone 15 Pro, we show that a CPU-only configuration (two
threads, F16 precision) achieves 17 tokens per second, surpassing the 12.8
tokens per second obtained with GPU acceleration. We analyze the architectural
factors driving this counterintuitive result, revealing that GPU memory
transfer overhead and CPU thread optimization play a critical role.
Furthermore, we explore the impact of thread oversubscription, quantization
strategies, and hardware constraints, providing new insights into efficient
on-device AI execution. Our findings challenge conventional GPU-first thinking,
highlighting the untapped potential of optimized CPU inference and paving the
way for smarter deployment strategies in mobile AI. However, fully explaining
the observed CPU advantage remains difficult due to limited access to low-level
profiling tools on iOS.

Abstract: Edge computing has emerged as a pivotal technology, offering significant
advantages such as low latency, enhanced data security, and reduced reliance on
centralized cloud infrastructure. These benefits are crucial for applications
requiring real-time data processing or strict security measures. Despite these
advantages, edge devices operating within edge clusters are often
underutilized. This inefficiency is mainly due to the absence of a holistic
performance profiling mechanism which can help dynamically adjust the desired
system configuration for a given workload. Since edge computing environments
involve a complex interplay between CPU frequency, power consumption, and
application performance, a deeper understanding of these correlations is
essential. By uncovering these relationships, it becomes possible to make
informed decisions that enhance both computational efficiency and energy
savings. To address this gap, this paper evaluates the power consumption and
performance characteristics of a single processing node within an edge cluster
using a synthetic microbenchmark by varying the workload size and CPU
frequency. The results show how an optimal measure can lead to optimized usage
of edge resources, given both performance and power consumption.

Abstract: In the context of the new mandatory labor compliance in the European Union
(EU), which will be implemented in 2027, supply chain enterprises face
stringent working hour management requirements and compliance risks. In order
to scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance
outcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological
framework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and
structural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic
transition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology,
this paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo
mechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path
analysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression,
mediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14
indicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response
speed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with
explanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
VIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment
has a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is
transmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile,
firms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this
mediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with
structural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity
regulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate
strategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the
pre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data. Keywords: AI synthetic data,

Abstract: AI promises personalized learning and scalable education. As AI agents
increasingly permeate education in support of teaching and learning, there is a
critical and urgent need for data architectures for collecting and analyzing
data on learning, and feeding the results back to teachers, learners, and the
AI agents for personalization of learning at scale. At the National AI
Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education, we are developing an
Architecture for AI-Augmented Learning (A4L) for supporting adult learning
through online education. We present the motivations, goals, requirements of
the A4L architecture. We describe preliminary applications of A4L and discuss
how it advances the goals of making learning more personalized and scalable.

TL;DR: 研究探讨企业架构管理（EAM）如何支持生成式人工智能（GenAI）在大型企业中的采用，结合文献综述和专家访谈，提出动态能力理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI潜力巨大但面临技术复杂性和治理挑战，需探索EAM如何助力其规模化应用。

Method: 基于系统文献综述和16位专家的半结构化访谈，采用Gioia方法分析数据。

Result: 现有EA框架对GenAI需求支持不足，EAM作为动态能力可提升战略对齐和治理，但需针对GenAI特点定制。

Conclusion: EAM能弥合创新与治理的鸿沟，需开发专门框架以应对GenAI的独特挑战。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is a powerful new technology with the
potential to boost innovation and reshape governance in many industries.
Nevertheless, organisations face major challenges in scaling GenAI, including
technology complexity, governance gaps and resource misalignments. This study
explores how Enterprise Architecture Management can meet the complex
requirements of GenAI adoption within large enterprises. Based on a systematic
literature review and the qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews
with experts, it examines the relationships between EAM, dynamic capabilities
and GenAI adoption. The review identified key limitations in existing EA
frameworks, particularly their inability to fully address the unique
requirements of GenAI. The interviews, analysed using the Gioia methodology,
revealed critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries.
The findings indicate that EAM, when theorised as sensing, seizing and
transforming dynamic capabilities, can enhance GenAI adoption by improving
strategic alignment, governance frameworks and organisational agility. However,
the study also highlights the need to tailor EA frameworks to GenAI-specific
challenges, including low data governance maturity and the balance between
innovation and compliance. Several conceptual frameworks are proposed to guide
EA leaders in aligning GenAI maturity with organisational readiness. The work
contributes to academic understanding and industry practice by clarifying the
role of EA in bridging innovation and governance in disruptive technology
environments.

Motivation: 探索生成式AI在国际象棋教学中的潜力，对比传统记忆法与新方法的差异。

Method: 采用准实验设计，使用PEFT技术微调Llama 3.3模型作为苏格拉底式导师，定量与定性分析结合。

Result: 实验组在三个变量上显著优于对照组，定性分析显示学生分析深度和动机提升。

Conclusion: Odychess方法有效，展示了生成式AI与教育结合的潜力，适用于其他教育领域。

Abstract: Chess teaching has evolved through different approaches, however, traditional
methodologies, often based on memorization, contrast with the new possibilities
offered by generative artificial intelligence, a technology still little
explored in this field. This study seeks to empirically validate the
effectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic
understanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study
was conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The
experimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a
Llama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess
tutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess
knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after
the intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed
significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control
group in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic
understanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis
revealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and
increased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess
method-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective
pedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the
synergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with
generative artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are relevant
for educators and institutions interested in adopting innovative pedagogical
technologies and for researchers in the field of AI applied to education,
highlighting the transferability of the language model adaptation methodology
to other educational domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现，企业在AI采用中更关注业务效率而非环境可持续性，绿色AI实践和法规意识普遍不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI采用中环境可持续性的角色及法规对绿色AI实践的影响。

Method: 对10家组织的11名参与者进行访谈，探讨AI采用、环境影响缓解及法规影响。

Result: 多数企业忽视环境可持续性，绿色AI实践有限，法规意识低。

Conclusion: 需提升行业意识，改进法规有效性，并提供绿色AI工具。

Abstract: With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based
software and its negative impact on the environment are no longer negligible,
and studying and mitigating this impact has become a critical area of research.
However, it is currently unclear which role environmental sustainability plays
during AI adoption in industry and how AI regulations influence Green AI
practices and decision-making in industry. We therefore aim to investigate the
Green AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we
conducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different
organizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three
main themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative
environmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that
9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with
minimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and
mitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant
monitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation
practices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically
mentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or
not overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with
only one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove
sustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies. All in all, our
findings reflect a lack of urgency and priority for sustainable AI among these
companies. We suggest that current regulations are not very effective, which
has implications for policymakers. Additionally, there is a need to raise
industry awareness, but also to provide user-friendly techniques and tools for
Green AI practices.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人们对肯定性算法（优先考虑历史上边缘化群体）的看法，并与歧视性算法和公平算法对比。结果显示，公平算法普遍受欢迎，而肯定性算法的态度因政治倾向和身份而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肯定性算法被视为解决算法歧视和历史不公的一种方式，但人们对这些算法的态度存在分歧，研究旨在揭示这些差异及其根源。

Method: 通过两项实验（N=1193）调查了人们对肯定性算法、歧视性算法和公平算法的态度，并分析了政治倾向和身份的影响。

Result: 公平算法普遍受欢迎，而肯定性算法的态度因政治倾向和身份差异显著：自由派和少数族裔对其评价与公平算法相当，保守派和主流族裔则评价较低。

Conclusion: 人们对边缘化群体的认知差异导致对肯定性算法的态度分歧，研究探讨了如何弥合这些分歧以推动肯定性算法的应用。

Abstract: Affirmative algorithms have emerged as a potential answer to algorithmic
discrimination, seeking to redress past harms and rectify the source of
historical injustices. We present the results of two experiments ($N$$=$$1193$)
capturing laypeople's perceptions of affirmative algorithms -- those which
explicitly prioritize the historically marginalized -- in hiring and criminal
justice. We contrast these opinions about affirmative algorithms with folk
attitudes towards algorithms that prioritize the privileged (i.e.,
discriminatory) and systems that make decisions independently of demographic
groups (i.e., fair). We find that people -- regardless of their political
leaning and identity -- view fair algorithms favorably and denounce
discriminatory systems. In contrast, we identify disagreements concerning
affirmative algorithms: liberals and racial minorities rate affirmative systems
as positively as their fair counterparts, whereas conservatives and those from
the dominant racial group evaluate affirmative algorithms as negatively as
discriminatory systems. We identify a source of these divisions: people have
varying beliefs about who (if anyone) is marginalized, shaping their views of
affirmative algorithms. We discuss the possibility of bridging these
disagreements to bring people together towards affirmative algorithms.

Motivation: 研究动机是填补金融科技等受监管行业中专业人士对大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）看法和应用的空白。

Method: 通过访谈金融科技行业的专业人士进行实证调查。

Result: 结果显示，金融科技专家认为大型语言模型有潜力，但对监管问题存疑。

Conclusion: 本文为大型语言模型的学术讨论增添了专业视角的理解。

Abstract: In November 2022, Europe and the world by and large were stunned by the birth
of a new large language model : ChatGPT. Ever since then, both academic and
populist discussions have taken place in various public spheres such as
LinkedIn and X(formerly known as Twitter) with the view to both understand the
tool and its benefits for the society. The views of real actors in professional
spaces, especially in regulated industries such as finance and law have been
largely missing. We aim to begin to close this gap by presenting results from
an empirical investigation conducted through interviews with professional
actors in the Fintech industry. The paper asks the question, how and to what
extent are large language models in general and ChatGPT in particular being
adopted and used in the Fintech industry? The results show that while the
fintech experts we spoke with see a potential in using large language models in
the future, a lot of questions marks remain concerning how they are policed and
therefore might be adopted in a regulated industry such as Fintech. This paper
aims to add to the existing academic discussing around large language models,
with a contribution to our understanding of professional viewpoints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS)策略，通过优化变分下界（VLB）来解决结构药物设计（SBDD）中的几何结构建模问题，显著提升了分子几何和相互作用建模的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型在几何结构建模中面临多模态（连续3D位置和离散2D拓扑）概率路径扭曲的挑战，这限制了分子几何的准确性。

Method: 通过分析噪声调度对变分下界（VLB）的影响，提出VOS策略，优化VLB作为路径积分，用于SBDD。

Result: 模型在CrossDock数据集上实现了95.9%的PoseBusters通过率，比基线提升超过10%，同时保持了高亲和力和分子内有效性。

Conclusion: VOS策略有效解决了多模态概率路径扭曲问题，显著提升了分子几何建模性能，为SBDD提供了新方法。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is crucial for identifying bioactive
molecules. Recent deep generative models are faced with challenges in geometric
structure modeling. A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of
multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which
jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise
schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability
path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored
area, which optimizes VLB as a path integral for SBDD. Our model effectively
enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling, achieving
state-of-the-art PoseBusters passing rate of 95.9% on CrossDock, more than 10%
improvement upon strong baselines, while maintaining high affinities and robust
intramolecular validity evaluated on held-out test set.

TL;DR: PC-SRGAN是一种改进的GAN方法，用于超分辨率图像生成，确保物理一致性，显著提升图像质量和物理意义，适用于科学领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN生成的超分辨率图像缺乏物理意义，限制了科学应用。PC-SRGAN旨在解决这一问题，提供物理一致的图像生成。

Method: PC-SRGAN结合了物理一致性约束和先进的量化指标，即使在有限训练数据下也能显著提升图像质量。

Result: PC-SRGAN在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于传统方法，仅需13%的训练数据即可达到SRGAN的效果。

Conclusion: PC-SRGAN不仅提升了超分辨率图像的质量和物理意义，还为科学机器学习提供了可靠的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has
revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack
physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our
approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical
consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both
the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure
compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only
13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments
physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified
time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise
reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A
significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its
physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for
time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning,
offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced
process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. The

Conclusion: GAN模型在MR T1到FDG PET转换中表现最佳，合成数据对无监督异常检测任务具有诊断价值。

Abstract: Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image
translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling
the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the
promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these
studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data,
especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare
different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first
perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then,
we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a
deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle
epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic
task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our
unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD
model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders
with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal
subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the
normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35
paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on
35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models.
Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing
surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating
realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around
0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true
control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET
data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that
GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation,
outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the
diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and
evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative
image dataset are available.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and
automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that
generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the
collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data
generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique
challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of
robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively
identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in
cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise
automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative
microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a
comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and
practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic
recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and
generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool
for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于云服务中CPU种类繁多且缺乏统一的向量搜索基准测试，用户难以选择最适合的CPU。

Method: 通过比较不同CPU微架构（如AMD Zen4、Intel Sapphire Rapids和Graviton3）在向量搜索场景中的性能（如QPS和QP$）。

Result: AMD Zen4在IVF索引上表现优于Intel Sapphire Rapids，但在HNSW索引中情况相反；Graviton3在性价比上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为用户在选择向量搜索系统时提供了性价比最优的指导。

Abstract: Vector databases have emerged as a new type of systems that support efficient
querying of high-dimensional vectors. Many of these offer their database as a
service in the cloud. However, the variety of available CPUs and the lack of
vector search benchmarks across CPUs make it difficult for users to choose one.
In this study, we show that CPU microarchitectures available in the cloud
perform significantly differently across vector search scenarios. For instance,
in an IVF index on float32 vectors, AMD's Zen4 gives almost 3x more queries per
second (QPS) compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids, but for HNSW indexes, the
tables turn. However, when looking at the number of queries per dollar (QP$),
Graviton3 is the best option for most indexes and quantization settings, even
over Graviton4 (Table 1). With this work, we hope to guide users in getting the
best "bang for the buck" when deploying vector search systems.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models and vision-language
models, AI agents have evolved from isolated, task-specific systems into
autonomous, interactive entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting
without human intervention. As these agents proliferate across virtual and
physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for
a unified, agent-centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we
introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables
seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration
among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA
architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing
features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next,
we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability
notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task
matching, consensus and conflict-resolution mechanisms, and incentive models.
Finally, we identify open research directions toward building resilient and
trustworthy IoA ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谵妄在MCI患者中具有高发病率和死亡率，研究旨在识别相关风险因素并开发预测模型。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库进行回顾性分析，结合Kaplan-Meier生存分析和LSTM模型，评估共病模式与谵妄风险。

Result: LSTM模型表现出色（AUROC 0.93，AUPRC 0.92），MCI患者谵妄后生存率显著降低。

Conclusion: 共病模式对谵妄风险评估至关重要，时间序列预测模型能有效识别高风险患者。

Abstract: Delirium represents a significant clinical concern characterized by high
morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). This study investigates the associated risk factors for
delirium by analyzing the comorbidity patterns relevant to MCI and developing a
longitudinal predictive model leveraging machine learning methodologies. A
retrospective analysis utilizing the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database was performed to
evaluate comorbid conditions, survival probabilities, and predictive modeling
outcomes. The examination of comorbidity patterns identified distinct risk
profiles for the MCI population. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated
that individuals with MCI exhibit markedly reduced survival probabilities when
developing delirium compared to their non-MCI counterparts, underscoring the
heightened vulnerability within this cohort. For predictive modeling, a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ML network was implemented utilizing time-series data,
demographic variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, and an array of
comorbid conditions. The model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities with
an AUROC of 0.93 and an AUPRC of 0.92. This study underscores the critical role
of comorbidities in evaluating delirium risk and highlights the efficacy of
time-series predictive modeling in pinpointing patients at elevated risk for
delirium development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预测模型可以高精度预测冲突，但将其转化为潜在的强制位移运动仍具挑战性，因为触发大规模人口流动的具体事件往往不明确。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类法，结合冲突预测与经济、政治和人口变量，生成国家特定的月度风险指数，预测期为1、3和6个月。

Result: 模型在预测显著位移流动方面表现出高准确性，在预测流动突然增加方面表现良好。后者因触发因素复杂而更难预测。

Conclusion: 风险指数为人道主义规划提供了有价值的定量支持，但应作为更广泛分析框架中的决策辅助工具。

Abstract: Monitoring tools for anticipatory action are increasingly gaining traction to
improve the efficiency and timeliness of humanitarian responses. Whilst
predictive models can now forecast conflicts with high accuracy, translating
these predictions into potential forced displacement movements remains
challenging because it is often unclear which precise events will trigger
significant population movements. This paper presents a novel monitoring
approach for refugee and asylum seeker flows that addresses this challenge.
Using gradient boosting classification, we combine conflict forecasts with a
comprehensive set of economic, political, and demographic variables to assess
two distinct risks at the country of origin: the likelihood of significant
displacement flows and the probability of sudden increases in these flows. The
model generates country-specific monthly risk indices for these two events with
prediction horizons of one, three, and six months. Our analysis shows high
accuracy in predicting significant displacement flows and good accuracy in
forecasting sudden increases in displacement--the latter being inherently more
difficult to predict, given the complexity of displacement triggers. We achieve

Abstract: Wind power plays an increasingly significant role in achieving the 2050 Net
Zero Strategy. Despite its rapid growth, its inherent variability presents
challenges in forecasting. Accurately forecasting wind power generation is one
key demand for the stable and controllable integration of renewable energy into
existing grid operations. This paper proposes an adaptive method for very
short-term forecasting that combines the generalised logit transformation with
a Bayesian approach. The generalised logit transformation processes
double-bounded wind power data to an unbounded domain, facilitating the
application of Bayesian methods. A novel adaptive mechanism for updating the
transformation shape parameter is introduced to leverage Bayesian updates by
recovering a small sample of representative data. Four adaptive forecasting
methods are investigated, evaluating their advantages and limitations through
an extensive case study of over 100 wind farms ranging four years in the UK.
The methods are evaluated using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score and we
propose the use of functional reliability diagrams to assess calibration.
Results indicate that the proposed Bayesian method with adaptive shape
parameter updating outperforms benchmarks, yielding consistent improvements in
CRPS and forecast reliability. The method effectively addresses uncertainty,
ensuring robust and accurate probabilistic forecasting which is essential for
grid integration and decision-making.

### [404] [A stochastic gradient method for trilevel optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06805)
*Tommaso Giovannelli,Griffin Dean Kent,Luis Nunes Vicente*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于解决无约束三层次优化问题的随机梯度下降方法，并提供了涵盖所有形式的三层次伴随梯度不精确性的收敛理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出了一种随机梯度下降方法，用于解决无约束三层次优化问题，并分析了伴随梯度的不精确性（如中间层和底层问题的不精确解、伴随公式的不精确计算以及梯度、Hessian、Jacobian和三阶导数张量的噪声估计）。

Abstract: With the success that the field of bilevel optimization has seen in recent
years, similar methodologies have started being applied to solving more
difficult applications that arise in trilevel optimization. At the helm of
these applications are new machine learning formulations that have been
proposed in the trilevel context and, as a result, efficient and theoretically
sound stochastic methods are required. In this work, we propose the first-ever
stochastic gradient descent method for solving unconstrained trilevel
optimization problems and provide a convergence theory that covers all forms of
inexactness of the trilevel adjoint gradient, such as the inexact solutions of
the middle-level and lower-level problems, inexact computation of the trilevel
adjoint formula, and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and
tensors of third-order derivatives involved. We also demonstrate the promise of
our approach by providing numerical results on both synthetic trilevel problems
and trilevel formulations for hyperparameter adversarial tuning.

*Ryan Cory-Wright,Andrés Gómez*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种嵌套k折交叉验证方案，通过最小化交叉验证指标和模型稳定性度量的加权和来选择超参数，以提升测试集性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于泛化理论，解决传统交叉验证可能导致验证集表现好但测试集表现差的问题。

Method: 采用嵌套k折交叉验证，选择超参数时结合交叉验证指标和模型稳定性度量，并通过嵌套交叉验证确定稳定性项的权重。

Result: 在13个UCI数据集上测试，稀疏岭回归和CART的样本外MSE平均提升4%，但对XGBoost无影响。

Conclusion: 对于稀疏回归和CART等不稳定模型，该方法能有效且经济地提升测试集性能。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of ensuring strong test-set performance via
cross-validation. Motivated by the generalization theory literature, we propose
a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme that selects hyperparameters by
minimizing a weighted sum of the usual cross-validation metric and an empirical
model-stability measure. The weight on the stability term is itself chosen via
a nested cross-validation procedure. This reduces the risk of strong validation
set performance and poor test set performance due to instability. We benchmark
our procedure on a suite of 13 real-world UCI datasets, and find that, compared
to k-fold cross-validation over the same hyperparameters, it improves the
out-of-sample MSE for sparse ridge regression and CART by 4% on average, but
has no impact on XGBoost. This suggests that for interpretable and unstable
models, such as sparse regression and CART, our approach is a viable and
computationally affordable method for improving test-set performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在收敛速度和时间尺度处理上优于现有方法，为MNE的近似提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The approximation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for zero-sum games with
mean-field interacting players has recently raised much interest in machine
learning. In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for
finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The
evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field
gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted
time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic
regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field
dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation
metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar
time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike
previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all
player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice
of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field
dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的感官差距，并提出了一种增强多模态LLM感知能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) are considered experts at recognizing
sound objects, yet their performance relative to LLMs in other sensory
modalities, such as visual or audio-visual LLMs, and to humans using their
ears, eyes, or both remains unexplored. To investigate this, we systematically
evaluate audio, visual, and audio-visual LLMs, specifically Qwen2-Audio,
Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-Omni, against humans in recognizing sound objects of
different classes from audio-only, silent video, or sounded video inputs. We
uncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the
sensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes. To reduce this gap, we
introduce a cross-modal distillation framework, where an LLM in one modality
serves as the teacher and another as the student, with knowledge transfer in
sound classes predicted as more challenging to the student by a heuristic
model. Distillation in both directions, from Qwen2-VL to Qwen2-Audio and vice
versa, leads to notable improvements, particularly in challenging classes. This
work highlights the sensory gap in LLMs from a human-aligned perspective and
proposes a principled approach to enhancing modality-specific perception in
multimodal LLMs.

Motivation: 现有端到端文本转语音模型计算复杂且内存消耗大，不适合低资源场景下的实时离线设备应用。

Method: 提出LE2E模型，通过轻量化设计减少计算资源和内存需求，并在LJSpeech数据集上评估。

Result: LE2E模型参数减少90%，实时因子提升10倍，且语音质量优于传统两阶段方法。

Conclusion: LE2E是一种适用于实时、高质量、低资源设备端文本转语音应用的有前景方法。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that modelling raw waveform directly from text in an
end-to-end (E2E) fashion produces more natural-sounding speech than traditional
neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on a cascade or two-stage approach.
However, current E2E state-of-the-art models are computationally complex and
memory-consuming, making them unsuitable for real-time offline on-device
applications in low-resource scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a
Lightweight E2E-TTS (LE2E) model that generates high-quality speech requiring
minimal computational resources. We evaluate the proposed model on the LJSpeech
dataset and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being up
to $90\%$ smaller in terms of model parameters and $10\times$ faster in
real-time-factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed E2E training
paradigm achieves better quality compared to an equivalent architecture trained
in a two-stage approach. Our results suggest that LE2E is a promising approach
for developing real-time, high quality, low-resource TTS applications for
on-device applications.

Abstract: Generalist Medical AI (GMAI) systems have demonstrated expert-level
performance in biomedical perception tasks, yet their clinical utility remains
limited by inadequate multi-modal explainability and suboptimal prognostic
capabilities. Here, we present XMedGPT, a clinician-centric, multi-modal AI
assistant that integrates textual and visual interpretability to support
transparent and trustworthy medical decision-making. XMedGPT not only produces
accurate diagnostic and descriptive outputs, but also grounds referenced
anatomical sites within medical images, bridging critical gaps in
interpretability and enhancing clinician usability. To support real-world
deployment, we introduce a reliability indexing mechanism that quantifies
uncertainty through consistency-based assessment via interactive
question-answering. We validate XMedGPT across four pillars: multi-modal
interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and prognostic modeling, and
rigorous benchmarking. The model achieves an IoU of 0.703 across 141 anatomical
regions, and a Kendall's tau-b of 0.479, demonstrating strong alignment between
visual rationales and clinical outcomes. For uncertainty estimation, it attains
an AUC of 0.862 on visual question answering and 0.764 on radiology report
generation. In survival and recurrence prediction for lung and glioma cancers,
it surpasses prior leading models by 26.9%, and outperforms GPT-4o by 25.0%.
Rigorous benchmarking across 347 datasets covers 40 imaging modalities and
external validation spans 4 anatomical systems confirming exceptional
generalizability, with performance gains surpassing existing GMAI by 20.7% for
in-domain evaluation and 16.7% on 11,530 in-house data evaluation. Together,
XMedGPT represents a significant leap forward in clinician-centric AI
integration, offering trustworthy and scalable support for diverse healthcare
applications.

Motivation: 从仅捕捉头部和手腕3关节的头戴设备推断全身姿态是一个具有挑战性的任务，传统单阶段映射方法因推断空间过大导致下半身预测不理想和时间一致性差。

Method: MAGE采用多阶段渐进预测策略，从初始3关节运动逐步推断多尺度身体部位姿态，从6部分身体表示细化到22关节，引入更多运动上下文先验以减少模糊性。

Result: 在大规模数据集上的实验表明，MAGE在准确性和连续性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGE通过多阶段渐进预测策略有效提升了从有限观测推断全身姿态的准确性和连续性。

Abstract: Inferring full-body poses from Head Mounted Devices, which capture only
3-joint observations from the head and wrists, is a challenging task with wide
AR/VR applications. Previous attempts focus on learning one-stage motion
mapping and thus suffer from an over-large inference space for unobserved body
joint motions. This often leads to unsatisfactory lower-body predictions and
poor temporal consistency, resulting in unrealistic or incoherent motion
sequences. To address this, we propose a powerful Multi-stage Avatar GEnerator
named MAGE that factorizes this one-stage direct motion mapping learning with a
progressive prediction strategy. Specifically, given initial 3-joint motions,
MAGE gradually inferring multi-scale body part poses at different abstract
granularity levels, starting from a 6-part body representation and gradually
refining to 22 joints. With decreasing abstract levels step by step, MAGE
introduces more motion context priors from former prediction stages and thus
improves realistic motion completion with richer constraint conditions and less
ambiguity. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets verify that MAGE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better accuracy and
continuity.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了一类利用自动驾驶实时性要求的新型攻击，对VLM增强驾驶系统的安全性和可靠性提出了严峻挑战。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been integrated into autonomous driving
systems to enhance reasoning capabilities through tasks such as Visual Question
Answering (VQA). However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor
attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural
reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving
scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual
triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural
surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM
dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories
or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This
strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon
encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and
LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs,
they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered,
potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving
decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates,
camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new
class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of
autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability
of VLM-augmented driving systems.

Motivation: StyleGAN/2在生成逼真人脸图像时存在特征纠缠问题，即修改某一特征（如性别或年龄）会影响其他特征（如表情）。这限制了其在面部表情研究中的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成表情固定但外观多样的人脸图像，为面部表情和手势研究提供了可靠的数据增强手段。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network approaches such as StyleGAN/2 provide two key
benefits: the ability to generate photo-realistic face images and possessing a
semantically structured latent space from which these images are created. Many
approaches have emerged for editing images derived from vectors in the latent
space of a pre-trained StyleGAN/2 models by identifying semantically meaningful
directions (e.g., gender or age) in the latent space. By moving the vector in a
specific direction, the ideal result would only change the target feature while
preserving all the other features. Providing an ideal data augmentation
approach for gesture research as it could be used to generate numerous image
variations whilst keeping the facial expressions intact. However, entanglement
issues, where changing one feature inevitably affects other features, impacts
the ability to preserve facial expressions. To address this, we propose the use
of an addition to the loss function of a Facial Keypoint Detection model to
restrict changes to the facial expressions. Building on top of an existing
model, adding the proposed Human Face Landmark Detection (HFLD) loss, provided
by a pre-trained Facial Keypoint Detection model, to the original loss
function. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the existing and our
extended model, showing the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the
entanglement issue and maintaining the facial expression. Our approach achieves
up to 49% reduction in the change of emotion in our experiments. Moreover, we
show the benefit of our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art models. By
increasing the ability to preserve the facial gesture and expression during
facial transformation, we present a way to create human face images with fixed
expression but different appearances, making it a reliable data augmentation
approach for Facial Gesture and Expression research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算效率低，深度学习方法缺乏灵活性和跨任务泛化性，基础模型虽具潜力但面临泛化和鲁棒性挑战。

Method: 将SAM集成到基础模型中，通过优化损失景观的平坦性来提升模型稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，结合SAM的基础模型在跨数据集配准性能上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像配准技术的进步提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing,
aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences
between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and
interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep
learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and
accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different
datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a
promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal
features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating
strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges
in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures,
varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations,
this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation
models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image
registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves
model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability
to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation
models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset
registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical
image registration technology. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的自适应跨模态融合网络（TACFN），解决了跨模态注意力融合中的冗余特征和互补特征捕获不足问题，并在RAVDESS和IEMOCAP数据集上取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态注意力融合方法在性能上表现优异，但存在冗余特征和互补特征捕获不足的问题。作者发现，跨模态交互中无需使用整个模态信息，仅需部分特征即可强化另一模态。

Method: 设计了TACFN，通过自注意力机制实现模态内特征选择，使选中的特征能自适应高效地与其他模态交互；通过拼接获取融合权重向量，实现模态特征强化。

Result: 在RAVDESS和IEMOCAP数据集上，TACFN显著优于其他方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TACFN有效解决了跨模态融合中的冗余和互补问题，为多模态情感识别任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The fusion technique is the key to the multimodal emotion recognition task.
Recently, cross-modal attention-based fusion methods have demonstrated high
performance and strong robustness. However, cross-modal attention suffers from
redundant features and does not capture complementary features well. We find
that it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to
reinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can
reinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an
innovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN).
Specifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform
intra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the
selected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another
modality. To better capture the complementary information between the
modalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight
vector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities. We apply TCAFN to
the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets. For fair comparison, we use the same unimodal
representations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method.
The experimental results show that TACFN brings a significant performance
improvement compared to other methods and reaches the state-of-the-art. All
code and models could be accessed from https://github.com/shuzihuaiyu/TACFN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法仅支持单张参考图像输入，限制了生成视角一致的时尚视频的能力，且运动模块对人体运动的建模不足。

Method: 提出Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator和Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator，分别通过姿态信息聚合参考特征和利用关键点运动流增强时空注意力。

Result: 在MRFashion-7K和UBC Fashion数据集上，ProFashion表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProFashion通过多参考图像和运动流优化，显著提升了时尚视频生成的视图一致性和时间连贯性。

Abstract: Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from
reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress,
existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as
input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion
videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from
different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not
sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal
consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video
generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved
view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from
multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we
devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global
and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form
frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To
further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype
Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra
spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the
MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also
outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段随机交替框架（TRA-PAN），通过结合降分辨率图像的强监督约束和全分辨率图像的物理特性，解决了深度学习全色锐化方法依赖真实高分辨率图像的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习全色锐化方法因难以获取真实高分辨率图像而受限，需要一种更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过退化感知建模（DAM）和预热过程预训练；第二阶段通过随机交替优化（RAO）结合降分辨率和全分辨率图像优化模型。

Result: TRA-PAN在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，且仅需单对图像即可实现零样本训练。

Conclusion: TRA-PAN展示了强大的实际应用潜力，解决了数据依赖问题并提升了融合质量。

Abstract: In recent years, pansharpening has seen rapid advancements with deep learning
methods, which have demonstrated impressive fusion quality. However, the
challenge of acquiring real high-resolution images limits the practical
applicability of these methods. To address this, we propose a two-stage random
alternating framework (TRA-PAN) that effectively integrates strong supervision
constraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of
full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training procedure,
which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spatial-spectral
degradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training
time and mitigate the negative effects of reduced-resolution data. In the
second stage, Random Alternation Optimization (RAO) is employed, where random
alternating training leverages the strengths of both reduced- and
full-resolution images, further optimizing the fusion model. By primarily
relying on full-resolution images, our method enables zero-shot training with
just a single image pair, obviating the need for large datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in
both quantitative metrics and visual quality in real-world scenarios,
highlighting its strong practical applicability.

Result: 实验结果表明FNBench能有效评估方法性能，提出的正则化方法增强了现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FNBench填补了联邦学习标签噪声研究的空白，并提出了未来研究方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Robustness to label noise within data is a significant challenge in federated
learning (FL). From the data-centric perspective, the data quality of
distributed datasets can not be guaranteed since annotations of different
clients contain complicated label noise of varying degrees, which causes the
performance degradation. There have been some early attempts to tackle noisy
labels in FL. However, there exists a lack of benchmark studies on
comprehensively evaluating their practical performance under unified settings.
To this end, we propose the first benchmark study FNBench to provide an
experimental investigation which considers three diverse label noise patterns
covering synthetic label noise, imperfect human-annotation errors and
systematic errors. Our evaluation incorporates eighteen state-of-the-art
methods over five image recognition datasets and one text classification
dataset. Meanwhile, we provide observations to understand why noisy labels
impair FL, and additionally exploit a representation-aware regularization
method to enhance the robustness of existing methods against noisy labels based
on our observations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this work and
propose three-fold future directions. To facilitate related communities, our
source code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Sprinter1999/FNBench.

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，同时保持实时性和低计算开销。

Conclusion: NAS-DETR是首个将DETR与NAS结合的声纳目标检测方法，具有高效性和高性能。

Abstract: Underwater object detection using sonar imagery has become a critical and
rapidly evolving research domain within marine technology. However, sonar
images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to
optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To
address these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer
(DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach
called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved
Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy
principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity
CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the
efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low
computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a
Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer
decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture
integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining
minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity.
Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential
entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of
the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in
the field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a
NAS search mechanism.

Motivation: 当前神经符号方法在CNN中提取规则成功，但ViTs因缺乏模块化概念检测器和依赖全局自注意力机制而难以应用类似技术。

Method: 引入稀疏概念层（受稀疏自编码器启发），结合L1稀疏性、熵最小化和监督对比损失，生成二值化概念表示，并用FOLD-SE-M算法提取逻辑程序。

Result: 分类准确率比标准ViT提高5.14%，生成的规则集可直接作为逻辑决策层，程序简洁且语义明确。

Conclusion: 首次从ViTs中提取可执行逻辑程序，填补了基于Transformer的视觉模型与符号逻辑编程之间的空白，推动了可解释和可验证的神经符号AI的发展。

Abstract: Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic
rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying
similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to
their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention
mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by
introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This
linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a
disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for
high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a
combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive
loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M
algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method
achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while
enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely
post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the
sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and
semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic
programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap
between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming,
providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.

Abstract: Domain generalization in image classification is a crucial challenge, with
models often failing to generalize well across unseen datasets. We address this
issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN)
layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex,
which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen
target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The
performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared
against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform
experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones
derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally,
in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of
deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also
propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute
similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain
image classification tasks. Our framework attempts to establish a foundation
for future neuro-inspired deep learning models.

Abstract: The mouse is one of the most studied animal models in the field of systems
neuroscience. Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural
representations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli
in the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In
recent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual
cortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized
efficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we
investigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep
learning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a
generalized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking
resemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and
high-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and
bottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity
across the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response
Normalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of
NeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and
observe significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in
domain generalization tasks. Our work proposes a novel framework for comparing
the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex with deep learning
models. Our findings carry broad implications for the development of advanced
AI models that draw inspiration from the mouse visual cortex, suggesting that
these models serve as valuable tools for studying the neural representations of
the mouse visual cortex and, as a result, enhancing their performance on
real-world tasks.

Abstract: Remote physiological sensing using camera-based technologies offers
transformative potential for non-invasive vital sign monitoring across
healthcare and human-computer interaction domains. Although deep learning
approaches have advanced the extraction of physiological signals from video
data, existing methods have not been sufficiently assessed for their robustness
to domain shifts. These shifts in remote physiological sensing include
variations in ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, facial
poses, and physiological states which often impact real-world performance
significantly. Cross-dataset evaluation provides an objective measure to assess
generalization capabilities across these domain shifts. We introduce Target
Signal Constrained Factorization module (TSFM), a novel multidimensional
attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates physiological signal
characteristics as factorization constraints, allowing more precise feature
extraction. Building on this innovation, we present MMRPhys, an efficient
dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture designed for simultaneous multitask estimation
of photoplethysmography (rPPG) and respiratory (rRSP) signals from multimodal
RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on
five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MMRPhys with TSFM significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization across domain shifts for
rPPG and rRSP estimation, while maintaining a minimal inference latency
suitable for real-time applications. Our approach establishes new benchmarks
for robust multitask and multimodal physiological sensing and offers a
computationally efficient framework for practical deployment in unconstrained
environments. The web browser-based application featuring on-device real-time

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a key task in industrial settings, where
minimizing waste and operational costs is essential. Deploying deep learning
models within Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduces specific
challenges due to the limited computational power and bandwidth of edge
devices. This study investigates how to perform VAD effectively under such
constraints by leveraging compact and efficient processing strategies. We
evaluate several data compression techniques, examining the trade-off between
system latency and detection accuracy. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark
demonstrate that significant compression can be achieved with minimal loss in
anomaly detection performance compared to uncompressed data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种学习型二维可分离变换（LST），作为构建图像识别任务神经网络架构的新计算层，显著减少参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过共享权重处理图像的行和列，减少模型参数，同时保持高性能。

Method: 使用两个共享的全连接层分别处理图像的行和列，构建LST层，并应用于神经网络架构。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，单LST层加全连接层的分类器达到98.02%准确率，仅需9.5k参数。

Conclusion: LST层为设计紧凑高效的神经网络模型提供了新思路，并在FPGA平台上验证了其可行性。

Abstract: The paper presents a learned two-dimensional separable transform (LST) that
can be considered as a new type of computational layer for constructing neural
network (NN) architecture for image recognition tasks. The LST based on the
idea of sharing the weights of one fullyconnected (FC) layer to process all
rows of an image. After that, a second shared FC layer is used to process all
columns of image representation obtained from the first layer. The use of LST
layers in a NN architecture significantly reduces the number of model
parameters compared to models that use stacked FC layers. We show that a
NN-classifier based on a single LST layer followed by an FC layer achieves
98.02\% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, while having only 9.5k parameters. We
also implemented a LST-based classifier for handwritten digit recognition on
the FPGA platform to demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested approach for
designing a compact and high-performance implementation of NN models. Git

*Wenqiang Wang,Yangshijie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IJIP的两阶段框架，用于解决视觉上下文学习中检索数据库不完整的问题，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，检索数据库可能仅包含部分类别的标注样本，导致现有方法性能受限。

Method: IJIP框架包括迭代判断阶段（将多分类问题转化为多个二分类任务）和集成预测阶段（结合输入图像和迭代判断结果提升分类精度）。

Result: IJIP在两种LVLM和两种数据集上表现优异，最高准确率达93.9%，且在标签完整时仍优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IJIP不仅适用于视觉领域，还可直接应用于提示学习和文本领域，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
Vision In-context Learning (VICL), a process that depends significantly on
demonstrations retrieved from an extensive collection of annotated examples
(retrieval database). Existing studies often assume that the retrieval database
contains annotated examples for all labels. However, in real-world scenarios,
delays in database updates or incomplete data annotation may result in the
retrieval database containing labeled samples for only a subset of classes. We
refer to this phenomenon as an \textbf{incomplete retrieval database} and
define the in-context learning under this condition as \textbf{Incomplete
In-context Learning (IICL)}. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Iterative Judgments and Integrated Prediction (IJIP)}, a two-stage
framework designed to mitigate the limitations of IICL. The Iterative Judgments
Stage reformulates an \(\boldsymbol{m}\)-class classification problem into a
series of \(\boldsymbol{m}\) binary classification tasks, effectively
converting the IICL setting into a standard VICL scenario. The Integrated
Prediction Stage further refines the classification process by leveraging both
the input image and the predictions from the Iterative Judgments Stage to
enhance overall classification accuracy. IJIP demonstrates considerable
performance across two LVLMs and two datasets under three distinct conditions
of label incompleteness, achieving the highest accuracy of 93.9\%. Notably,
even in scenarios where labels are fully available, IJIP still achieves the
best performance of all six baselines. Furthermore, IJIP can be directly
applied to \textbf{Prompt Learning} and is adaptable to the \textbf{text
domain}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableMotion利用预训练的大规模图像扩散模型知识，通过单图像完成图像校正任务（如SIR和RSC），并提出了Adaptive Ensemble Strategy（AES）和Sampling Steps Disaster（SSD）概念，实现了高效、高性能的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像校正任务（如SIR和RSC）中传统方法难以处理的问题，并利用扩散模型的潜力提升性能。

Method: 以Stable Diffusion（SD）模型为基础，将其改造为图像到运动估计器，提出AES整合多输出，并通过SSD实现一步推理。

Result: 在两项图像校正任务中表现优异，速度提升200倍，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: StableMotion通过创新方法显著提升了图像校正任务的效率和性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present StableMotion, a novel framework leverages knowledge (geometry and
content priors) from pretrained large-scale image diffusion models to perform
motion estimation, solving single-image-based image rectification tasks such as
Stitched Image Rectangling (SIR) and Rolling Shutter Correction (RSC).
Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD)
models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To
mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive
Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive,
high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps
Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of
sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to
achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification
tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing
strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200
times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类通常需要大量训练样本，主动学习通过选择高价值样本减少所需样本数量，提高效率。

Method: 使用不确定性度量（四种不同方法）为图像样本赋值，选择高价值样本训练CNN分类器。

Result: 在MNIST和Fruits360数据集上验证了主动学习的有效性，尤其在复杂任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 主动学习是图像分类问题的可行算法，尤其在复杂任务中效果显著。

Abstract: A principle bottleneck in image classification is the large number of
training examples needed to train a classifier. Using active learning, we can
reduce the number of training examples to teach a CNN classifier by
strategically selecting examples. Assigning values to image examples using
different uncertainty metrics allows the model to identify and select
high-value examples in a smaller training set size. We demonstrate results for
digit recognition and fruit classification on the MNIST and Fruits360 data
sets. We formally compare results for four different uncertainty metrics.
Finally, we observe active learning is also effective on simpler (binary)
classification tasks, but marked improvement from random sampling is more
evident on more difficult tasks. We show active learning is a viable algorithm
for image classification problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的背景减除技术难以应对视频中的多种背景噪声（如光照变化、相机角度变化等），需要更鲁棒且高效的方法。

Method: 设计了连续脉冲卷积-反卷积块作为基础模块，并引入基于ANN-to-SNN框架的自蒸馏监督学习方法。

Result: 在CDnet-2014和DAVIS-2016数据集上表现优于基线方法，尤其在动态背景复杂场景中。

Conclusion: SAEN-BGS通过脉冲神经网络和自蒸馏学习，显著提升了背景减除的性能和能效。

Abstract: Background subtraction (BGS) is utilized to detect moving objects in a video
and is commonly employed at the onset of object tracking and human recognition
processes. Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still
encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including
variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air
turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking
autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and
time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the
separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background
noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the
continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental
building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced
energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised
learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power
consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016
datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative
to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with
dynamic backgrounds.

Conclusion: GPDiT是一种高效的连续空间视频建模框架。

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive
Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and
autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous
latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively
predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling
of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous
autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows
the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based
time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference
efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong
performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and
few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework
for video modeling in continuous space.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种仅需少量训练样本的语义编解码方法，提升了语义通信系统的实用性。

Abstract: With the continuous increase in the number and resolution of video
surveillance cameras, the burden of transmitting and storing surveillance video
is growing. Traditional communication methods based on Shannon's theory are
facing optimization bottlenecks. Semantic communication, as an emerging
communication method, is expected to break through this bottleneck and reduce
the storage and transmission consumption of video. Existing semantic decoding
methods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding
and decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was
extracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed
to reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation
network was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a
reference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to
reconstruct video from sketch. Experimental results showed that the proposed
method achieved significantly better video reconstruction performance than
baseline methods. The sketch compression method could effectively reduce the
storage and transmission consumption of semantic information with little
compromise on video quality. The proposed method provides a novel semantic
encoding and decoding method that only needs a few training samples for each
surveillance scene, thus improving the practicality of the semantic
communication system.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督学习方法UCDM，通过构建正负样本对和置信度标记机制，解决了训练数据与目标任务间类别分布不匹配的问题，显著优于现有半监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类别分布不匹配（CDM）问题，现有方法依赖标记数据且局限于半监督场景，限制了其应用和性能。

Method: 提出UCDM方法，从无标记数据中构建正负样本对，利用扩散模型合成多样训练对，并引入置信度标记机制迭代分配伪标签。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，UCDM在Tiny-ImageNet上以60%不匹配比例，无标记数据下显著优于OpenMatch（每类40标记）。

Conclusion: UCDM是一种高效的无监督方法，适用于类别分布不匹配问题，性能显著优于半监督方法。

Abstract: Class distribution mismatch (CDM) refers to the discrepancy between class
distributions in training data and target tasks. Previous methods address this
by designing classifiers to categorize classes known during training, while
grouping unknown or new classes into an "other" category. However, they focus
on semi-supervised scenarios and heavily rely on labeled data, limiting their
applicability and performance. To address this, we propose Unsupervised
Learning for Class Distribution Mismatch (UCDM), which constructs
positive-negative pairs from unlabeled data for classifier training. Our
approach randomly samples images and uses a diffusion model to add or erase
semantic classes, synthesizing diverse training pairs. Additionally, we
introduce a confidence-based labeling mechanism that iteratively assigns
pseudo-labels to valuable real-world data and incorporates them into the
training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UCDM's
superiority over previous semi-supervised methods. Specifically, with a 60%
mismatch proportion on Tiny-ImageNet dataset, our approach, without relying on
labeled data, surpasses OpenMatch (with 40 labels per class) by 35.1%, 63.7%,
and 72.5% in classifying known, unknown, and new classes.

Conclusion: MAIS通过整合时间上下文，显著改进了交互式医学分割的性能。

Abstract: Interactive medical segmentation reduces annotation effort by refining
predictions through user feedback. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, such
as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), achieve state-of-the-art performance using
user clicks and prior masks as prompts. However, existing methods treat
interactions as independent events, leading to redundant corrections and
limited refinement gains. We address this by introducing MAIS, a
Memory-Attention mechanism for Interactive Segmentation that stores past user
inputs and segmentation states, enabling temporal context integration. Our
approach enhances ViT-based segmentation across diverse imaging modalities,
achieving more efficient and accurate refinements.

Conclusion: Gut-VLM数据集和幻觉感知微调方法为医学VLM研究提供了新方向，有效减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the
medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language.
Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images
and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports.
However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are
inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with
particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM
research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we
curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created
using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2
images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or
incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review
these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure
high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that
contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying
hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach
to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale,
problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our
dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports,
we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call
hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better
than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several
metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法未能充分考虑生理条件（如体力活动、药物和压力）对ECG模式的交互影响，限制了其实际应用。

Method: IKrNet采用卷积主干网络捕捉空间特征，结合双向LSTM建模时间依赖性，并以心率变异性作为生理波动的替代指标。

Result: 在包含体力压力、药物摄入和基线条件的多样化场景中，IKrNet在准确性和稳定性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: IKrNet在多变生理条件下表现出临床可行性，为ECG监测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, even under varying
physiological conditions, including those influenced by physical activity,
drugs and stress, is crucial to accurately assess cardiac health. However,
current AI-based methods often fail to account for how these factors interact
and alter ECG patterns, ultimately limiting their applicability in real-world
settings. This study introduces IKrNet, a novel neural network model, which
identifies drug-specific patterns in ECGs amidst certain physiological
conditions. IKrNet's architecture incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics by
using a convolutional backbone with varying receptive field size to capture
spatial features. A bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory module is also
employed to model temporal dependencies. By treating heart rate variability as
a surrogate for physiological fluctuations, we evaluated IKrNet's performance
across diverse scenarios, including conditions with physical stress, drug
intake alone, and a baseline without drug presence. Our assessment follows a
clinical protocol in which 990 healthy volunteers were administered 80mg of
Sotalol, a drug which is known to be a precursor to Torsades-de-Pointes, a
life-threatening arrhythmia. We show that IKrNet outperforms state-of-the-art
models' accuracy and stability in varying physiological conditions,
underscoring its clinical viability.

Conclusion: 该方法无需大量手动标注，为非侵入式分析教师视觉注意力提供了可能，有助于改进教学策略和教师专业发展。

Abstract: Teachers' visual attention and its distribution across the students in
classrooms can constitute important implications for student engagement,
achievement, and professional teacher training. Despite that, inferring the
information about where and which student teachers focus on is not trivial.
Mobile eye tracking can provide vital help to solve this issue; however, the
use of mobile eye tracking alone requires a significant amount of manual
annotations. To address this limitation, we present an automated processing
pipeline concept that requires minimal manually annotated data to recognize
which student the teachers focus on. To this end, we utilize state-of-the-art
face detection models and face recognition feature embeddings to train face
recognition models with transfer learning in the classroom context and combine
these models with the teachers' gaze from mobile eye trackers. We evaluated our
approach with data collected from four different classrooms, and our results
show that while it is possible to estimate the visually focused students with
reasonable performance in all of our classroom setups, U-shaped and small
classrooms led to the best results with accuracies of approximately 0.7 and
0.9, respectively. While we did not evaluate our method for teacher-student
interactions and focused on the validity of the technical approach, as our
methodology does not require a vast amount of manually annotated data and
offers a non-intrusive way of handling teachers' visual attention, it could
help improve instructional strategies, enhance classroom management, and
provide feedback for professional teacher development.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality segmentation has important potential to enhance the
clinical workflow, especially in settings requiring quantitative assessments.
Kidney volume could serve as an important biomarker for renal diseases, with
changes in volume correlating directly with kidney function. Currently,
clinical practice often relies on subjective visual assessment for evaluating
kidney size and abnormalities, including tumors and cysts, which are typically
staged based on diameter, volume, and anatomical location. To support a more
objective and reproducible approach, this research aims to develop a robust,
thoroughly validated kidney abnormality segmentation algorithm, made publicly
available for clinical and research use. We employ publicly available training
datasets and leverage the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation framework
nnU-Net. Validation is conducted using both proprietary and public test
datasets, with segmentation performance quantified by Dice coefficient and the
95th percentile Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, we analyze robustness across
subgroups based on patient sex, age, CT contrast phases, and tumor histologic
subtypes. Our findings demonstrate that our segmentation algorithm, trained
exclusively on publicly available data, generalizes effectively to external
test sets and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across all tested
datasets. Subgroup analyses reveal consistent high performance, indicating
strong robustness and reliability. The developed algorithm and associated code

methods rely on computationally intensive procedures and struggle to
efficiently capture complex, semantic concepts. Recently, the Concept Discovery
through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT) framework,
introduced by Varshney et al. (2025), attempts to identify concepts via
dimension-wise traversal of the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder
trained on counterfactual trajectories. Extending the CDCT framework, this work
introduces Concept Directions via Latent Clustering (CDLC), which extracts
global, class-specific concept directions by clustering latent difference
vectors derived from factual and diffusion-generated counterfactual image
pairs. CDLC substantially reduces computational complexity by eliminating the
exhaustive latent dimension traversal required in CDCT and enables the
extraction of multidimensional semantic concepts encoded across the latent
dimensions. This approach is validated on a real-world skin lesion dataset,
demonstrating that the extracted concept directions align with clinically
recognized dermoscopic features and, in some cases, reveal dataset-specific
biases or unknown biomarkers. These results highlight that CDLC is
interpretable, scalable, and applicable across high-stakes domains and diverse
data modalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型混合脉冲视觉Transformer（HsVT）模型，用于提升事件目标检测性能，并公开了Fall Detection数据集作为基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件目标检测因其高时间分辨率、宽动态范围和异步事件表示等优势受到关注，但现有方法性能有待提升。

Method: HsVT模型结合空间特征提取模块（捕获局部和全局特征）和时间特征提取模块（建模时间依赖性和长期模式）。

Result: 在GEN1和Fall Detection数据集上，HsVT以较少参数显著提升了事件检测性能。

Conclusion: HsVT模型有效提升了事件目标检测能力，公开数据集为相关研究提供了基准支持。

Abstract: Event-based object detection has gained increasing attention due to its
advantages such as high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and
asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low
energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the
performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid
spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial
feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal
feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in
event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal
features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object
detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly
released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object
detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures
facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event
representation format. We evaluated the HsVT model on GEN1 and Fall Detection
datasets across various model sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT
achieves significant performance improvements in event detection with fewer
parameters.

Abstract: Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become essential for managing cities and
integrating complex, heterogeneous data from diverse sources. Creating UDTs
involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D
source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models'
updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks. Current
datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering
comprehensive UDTs validation. To address these challenges, we introduce the
first comprehensive multimodal Urban Digital Twin benchmark dataset: TUM2TWIN.
This dataset includes georeferenced, semantically aligned 3D models and
networks along with various terrestrial, mobile, aerial, and satellite
observations boasting 32 data subsets over roughly 100,000 $m^2$ and currently
767 GB of data. By ensuring georeferenced indoor-outdoor acquisition, high
accuracy, and multimodal data integration, the benchmark supports robust
analysis of sensors and the development of advanced reconstruction methods.
Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of
TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar
potential analysis, point cloud semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building
reconstruction. We are convinced this contribution lays a foundation for
overcoming current limitations in UDT creation, fostering new research
directions and practical solutions for smarter, data-driven urban environments.

TL;DR: DocVXQA是一个视觉自解释的文档问答框架，通过生成视觉热图提供解释，同时平衡性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注与答案相关的区域，缺乏上下文充分的解释，DocVXQA旨在提供更全面的解释以增强用户信任。

Method: 通过将可解释性原则量化为显式学习目标，生成上下文充分且表示高效的热图。

Result: 实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性，代码已开源。

Conclusion: DocVXQA在文档问答中实现了性能与可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: We propose DocVXQA, a novel framework for visually self-explainable document
question answering. The framework is designed not only to produce accurate
answers to questions but also to learn visual heatmaps that highlight
contextually critical regions, thereby offering interpretable justifications
for the model's decisions. To integrate explanations into the learning process,
we quantitatively formulate explainability principles as explicit learning
objectives. Unlike conventional methods that emphasize only the regions
pertinent to the answer, our framework delivers explanations that are
\textit{contextually sufficient} while remaining
\textit{representation-efficient}. This fosters user trust while achieving a
balance between predictive performance and interpretability in DocVQA
applications. Extensive experiments, including human evaluation, provide strong
evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at
https://github.com/dali92002/DocVXQA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在卷积神经网络中嵌入高阶操作的新方法，提升神经响应预测能力，无需增加网络深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CNN在模拟生物视觉系统时深度不足的问题，同时提升模型的表示能力。

Method: 扩展传统3D CNN，在卷积操作中嵌入高阶操作，直接建模像素间的乘法交互。

Result: 在两种数据集上表现优异，训练数据需求减半，相关性系数达0.75，对几何变换参数编码能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 高阶CNN在神经响应预测中表现优越，尤其适用于特定细胞类型，为生物视觉系统建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural response prediction that incorporates
higher-order operations directly within convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our model extends traditional 3D CNNs by embedding higher-order operations
within the convolutional operator itself, enabling direct modeling of
multiplicative interactions between neighboring pixels across space and time.
Our model increases the representational power of CNNs without increasing their
depth, therefore addressing the architectural disparity between deep artificial
networks and the relatively shallow processing hierarchy of biological visual
systems. We evaluate our approach on two distinct datasets: salamander retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) responses to natural scenes, and a new dataset of mouse RGC
responses to controlled geometric transformations. Our higher-order CNN (HoCNN)
achieves superior performance while requiring only half the training data
compared to standard architectures, demonstrating correlation coefficients up
to 0.75 with neural responses (against 0.80$\pm$0.02 retinal reliability). When
integrated into state-of-the-art architectures, our approach consistently
improves performance across different species and stimulus conditions. Analysis
of the learned representations reveals that our network naturally encodes
fundamental geometric transformations, particularly scaling parameters that
characterize object expansion and contraction. This capability is especially
relevant for specific cell types, such as transient OFF-alpha and transient ON
cells, which are known to detect looming objects and object motion
respectively, and where our model shows marked improvement in response
prediction. The correlation coefficients for scaling parameters are more than
twice as high in HoCNN (0.72) compared to baseline models (0.32).

Abstract: We introduce a new type of foundational model for parsing human anatomy in
medical images that works for different modalities. It supports supervised or
unsupervised training and can perform matching, registration, classification,
or segmentation with or without user interaction. We achieve this by training a
neural network estimator that maps query locations to atlas coordinates via
regression. Efficiency is improved by sparsely sampling the input, enabling
response times of less than 1 ms without additional accelerator hardware. We
demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in both CT and MRI modalities.

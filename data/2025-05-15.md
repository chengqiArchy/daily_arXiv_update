### [1] [Human-AI Collaboration or Academic Misconduct? Measuring AI Use in Student Writing Through Stylometric Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08828)
*Eduardo Araujo Oliveira,Madhavi Mohoni,Sonsoles López-Pernas,Mohammed Saqr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用作者验证技术量化AI在学术写作中的辅助作用，旨在提升透明度和学生发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人机协作在教育中的普及，理解并衡量这种互动的程度和性质成为挑战。研究旨在通过作者验证技术促进透明度和学术诚信。

Method: 研究分为三个阶段：数据集选择与扩展、作者验证方法开发、系统评估。使用了三个数据集，包括公开数据集和学生写作样本，开发了适应性特征向量差异方法。

Result: 改进的作者验证分类器能有效识别学生写作与AI生成文本的风格差异，并在不同场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了作者验证技术的发展，为AI时代的学术写作提供了实用工具和见解。

Abstract: As human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent in educational
contexts, understanding and measuring the extent and nature of such
interactions pose significant challenges. This research investigates the use of
authorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a
means to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting
transparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior
work, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and
expansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three
datasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of
Melbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include
LLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from
506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology
to construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture
meaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's
effectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing
between student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against
LLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the
enhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and
measure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing
educators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.
This work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the
dynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era.

### [2] [Clicking some of the silly options: Exploring Player Motivation in Static and Dynamic Educational Interactive Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08891)
*Daeun Hwang,Samuel Shields,Alex Calderwood,Shi Johnson-Bey,Michael Mateas,Noah Wardrip-Fruin,Edward F. Melcer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较静态和动态叙事教育游戏对学习动机的影响，发现动态叙事能提升参与度，但需平衡教学目标和叙事动态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态叙事对学习动机的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发两种版本的互动叙事游戏Academical，分别采用静态分支叙事和动态序列叙事，并进行比较。

Result: 动态叙事能提升玩家参与度，但需平衡教学目标和叙事动态性。

Conclusion: AI驱动的动态叙事在教育游戏中具有潜力，但需进一步探索设计方法。

Abstract: Motivation is an important factor underlying successful learning. Previous
research has demonstrated the positive effects that static interactive
narrative games can have on motivation. Concurrently, advances in AI have made
dynamic and adaptive approaches to interactive narrative increasingly
accessible. However, limited work has explored the impact that dynamic
narratives can have on learner motivation. In this paper, we compare two
versions of Academical, a choice-based educational interactive narrative game
about research ethics. One version employs a traditional hand-authored
branching plot (i.e., static narrative) while the other dynamically sequences
plots during play (i.e., dynamic narrative). Results highlight the importance
of responsive content and a variety of choices for player engagement, while
also illustrating the challenge of balancing pedagogical goals with the dynamic
aspects of narrative. We also discuss design implications that arise from these
findings. Ultimately, this work provides initial steps to illuminate the
emerging potential of AI-driven dynamic narrative in educational games.

### [3] [A suite of LMs comprehend puzzle statements as well as humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08996)
*Adele E Goldberg,Supantho Rakshit,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 重新评估人类与大型语言模型在理解简单英语语句上的表现，发现人类表现被高估，而模型能力被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳先前认为大型语言模型在语言理解上弱于人类的观点，强调实验设计和编码实践的重要性。

Method: 通过预注册研究，比较人类在允许重读和限制重读条件下的表现，并与多个模型（如Falcon-180B-Chat、GPT-4等）进行对比。

Result: 人类在限制重读条件下准确率显著下降（73%），低于部分模型（如GPT-4的81%）。新模型GPT-o1表现完美。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前模型在语言理解上弱于人类的假设，并呼吁更严谨的实验设计和评估方法。

Abstract: Recent claims suggest that large language models (LMs) underperform humans in
comprehending minimally complex English statements (Dentella et al., 2024).
Here, we revisit those findings and argue that human performance was
overestimated, while LLM abilities were underestimated. Using the same stimuli,
we report a preregistered study comparing human responses in two conditions:
one allowed rereading (replicating the original study), and one that restricted
rereading (a more naturalistic comprehension test). Human accuracy dropped
significantly when rereading was restricted (73%), falling below that of
Falcon-180B-Chat (76%) and GPT-4 (81%). The newer GPT-o1 model achieves perfect
accuracy. Results further show that both humans and models are
disproportionately challenged by queries involving potentially reciprocal
actions (e.g., kissing), suggesting shared pragmatic sensitivities rather than
model-specific deficits. Additional analyses using Llama-2-70B log
probabilities, a recoding of open-ended model responses, and grammaticality
ratings of other sentences reveal systematic underestimation of model
performance. We find that GPT-4o can align with either naive or expert
grammaticality judgments, depending on prompt framing. These findings
underscore the need for more careful experimental design and coding practices
in LLM evaluation, and they challenge the assumption that current models are
inherently weaker than humans at language comprehension.

### [4] [For GPT-4 as with Humans: Information Structure Predicts Acceptability of Long-Distance Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09005)
*Nicole Cuneo,Eleanor Graves,Supantho Rakshit,Adele E. Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型（LM）是否能理解和生成可靠的元语言判断，并研究了GPT-4在信息结构和句法关系中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能捕捉人类语言中形式与功能的微妙关系，尤其是信息结构与长距离依赖（LDD）结构之间的关联。

Method: 通过实验（Study 1a, 1b）测试GPT-4在信息结构和可接受性任务中的表现，并在Study 2中操纵信息结构以验证因果关系。

Result: GPT-4在零样本任务中表现出可靠的元语言能力，并复制了信息结构与LDD可接受性之间的显著交互作用。

Conclusion: GPT-4生成的英语与自然语言在信息结构和句法关系上存在紧密联系，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: It remains debated how well any LM understands natural language or generates
reliable metalinguistic judgments. Moreover, relatively little work has
demonstrated that LMs can represent and respect subtle relationships between
form and function proposed by linguists. We here focus on a particular such
relationship established in recent work: English speakers' judgments about the
information structure of canonical sentences predicts independently collected
acceptability ratings on corresponding 'long distance dependency' [LDD]
constructions, across a wide array of base constructions and multiple types of
LDDs. To determine whether any LM captures this relationship, we probe GPT-4 on
the same tasks used with humans and new extensions.Results reveal reliable
metalinguistic skill on the information structure and acceptability tasks,
replicating a striking interaction between the two, despite the zero-shot,
explicit nature of the tasks, and little to no chance of contamination [Studies
1a, 1b]. Study 2 manipulates the information structure of base sentences and
confirms a causal relationship: increasing the prominence of a constituent in a
context sentence increases the subsequent acceptability ratings on an LDD
construction. The findings suggest a tight relationship between natural and
GPT-4 generated English, and between information structure and syntax, which
begs for further exploration.

### [5] [Atomic Consistency Preference Optimization for Long-Form Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09039)
*Jingfeng Chen,Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Junlin Wang,Kaiwei Luo,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自监督的偏好优化方法ACPO，通过利用原子一致性信号提升LLMs的事实准确性，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs生成事实性幻觉问题，避免依赖外部模型或知识库。

Method: 提出ACPO方法，利用多响应中的原子一致性信号识别高质量数据对进行模型对齐。

Result: ACPO在LongFact和BioGen数据集上比监督基线FactAlign高出1.95分。

Conclusion: ACPO是一种高效且可扩展的方法，显著提升LLMs的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factoid hallucinations -
plausible yet incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is model
alignment, which improves factual accuracy by training on curated factual and
non-factual pairs. However, this approach often relies on a stronger model
(e.g., GPT-4) or an external knowledge base to assess factual correctness,
which may not always be accessible. To address this, we propose Atomic
Consistency Preference Optimization (ACPO), a self-supervised preference-tuning
method that enhances factual accuracy without external supervision. ACPO
leverages atomic consistency signals, i.e., the agreement of individual facts
across multiple stochastic responses, to identify high- and low-quality data
pairs for model alignment. By eliminating the need for costly GPT calls, ACPO
provides a scalable and efficient approach to improving factoid
question-answering. Despite being self-supervised, empirical results
demonstrate that ACPO outperforms FactAlign, a strong supervised alignment
baseline, by 1.95 points on the LongFact and BioGen datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing factual reliability without relying on external
models or knowledge bases.

### [6] [A Comprehensive Analysis of Large Language Model Outputs: Similarity, Diversity, and Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09056)
*Brandon Smith,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Tahsin Alamgir Kheya,Phillip Dawson,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了12种大型语言模型（LLM）的输出相似性、多样性和伦理表现，发现同一模型的输出相似度高，不同模型间差异显著，GPT-4表现独特，部分模型在伦理方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在输出相似性、多样性和伦理标准方面的表现，为未来开发和伦理评估提供依据。

Method: 使用5,000个多样化提示任务，生成约300万文本，覆盖12种LLM（包括开源和专有系统）。

Result: 同一LLM的输出相似度高；不同模型间差异显著（如GPT-4多样性高）；词汇和风格差异明显；部分模型在性别平衡和偏见减少方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM输出的行为和多样性特征，为未来开发和伦理评估提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a major step toward artificial general
intelligence, significantly advancing our ability to interact with technology.
While LLMs perform well on Natural Language Processing tasks -- such as
translation, generation, code writing, and summarization -- questions remain
about their output similarity, variability, and ethical implications. For
instance, how similar are texts generated by the same model? How does this
compare across different models? And which models best uphold ethical
standards? To investigate, we used 5{,}000 prompts spanning diverse tasks like
generation, explanation, and rewriting. This resulted in approximately 3
million texts from 12 LLMs, including proprietary and open-source systems from
OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Mistral. Key findings include: (1) outputs
from the same LLM are more similar to each other than to human-written texts;
(2) models like WizardLM-2-8x22b generate highly similar outputs, while GPT-4
produces more varied responses; (3) LLM writing styles differ significantly,
with Llama 3 and Mistral showing higher similarity, and GPT-4 standing out for
distinctiveness; (4) differences in vocabulary and tone underscore the
linguistic uniqueness of LLM-generated content; (5) some LLMs demonstrate
greater gender balance and reduced bias. These results offer new insights into
the behavior and diversity of LLM outputs, helping guide future development and
ethical evaluation.

### [7] [S-DAT: A Multilingual, GenAI-Driven Framework for Automated Divergent Thinking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09068)
*Jennifer Haase,Paul H. P. Hanel,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S-DAT是一种基于大型语言模型和多语言嵌入的框架，用于自动化评估发散思维（DT），克服了传统创造力评估的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创造力评估方法耗时、语言依赖性强且主观，限制了其可扩展性和跨文化适用性。

Method: 利用大型语言模型和多语言嵌入计算语义距离，作为DT的语言无关代理。

Result: 在11种语言中验证了S-DAT的稳健性和一致性，并展示了与其他DT测量的收敛效度。

Conclusion: S-DAT为全球范围的创造力研究提供了更公平、更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces S-DAT (Synthetic-Divergent Association Task), a
scalable, multilingual framework for automated assessment of divergent thinking
(DT) -a core component of human creativity. Traditional creativity assessments
are often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human
ratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In
contrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual
embeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We
evaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish,
German, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating
robust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts. Unlike prior DAT
approaches, the S-DAT shows convergent validity with other DT measures and
correct discriminant validity with convergent thinking. This cross-linguistic
flexibility allows for more inclusive, global-scale creativity research,
addressing key limitations of earlier approaches. S-DAT provides a powerful
tool for fairer, more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility in
diverse populations and can be freely assessed online:

### [8] [CEC-Zero: Chinese Error Correction Solution Based on LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09082)
*Sophie Zhang,Zhiming Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CEC-Zero是一种基于强化学习的新型框架，使大语言模型（LLMs）能够通过自主错误策略学习自我纠正，无需外部监督。该方法结合了强化学习与LLMs的生成能力，显著提升了中文拼写纠正的准确性和跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在中文文本处理（如拼写纠正）中表现出色，但其可靠性和泛化能力仍有待提升。传统方法依赖标注数据或辅助模型，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 提出CEC-Zero框架，通过强化学习使LLMs自主学习和纠正错误，无需外部监督或额外数据。

Result: 实验表明，RL增强的LLMs在中文拼写纠正中实现了行业可行的准确性，并展现出卓越的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CEC-Zero为中文NLP应用的可靠性优化提供了可扩展的解决方案，并为自改进语言模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
Chinese text processing capabilities, particularly in Chinese Spelling
Correction (CSC). While LLMs outperform traditional BERT-based models in
accuracy and robustness, challenges persist in reliability and generalization.
This paper proposes CEC-Zero, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework
enabling LLMs to self-correct through autonomous error strategy learning
without external supervision. By integrating RL with LLMs' generative power,
the method eliminates dependency on annotated data or auxiliary models.
Experiments reveal RL-enhanced LLMs achieve industry-viable accuracy and
superior cross-domain generalization, offering a scalable solution for
reliability optimization in Chinese NLP applications. This breakthrough
facilitates LLM deployment in practical Chinese text correction scenarios while
establishing a new paradigm for self-improving language models.

Result: 工具成功实现了类图与对象图的集成及对象执行，适用于教学与研究。

Conclusion: 该项目展示了研究如何通过多级架构产生有价值的副产品，为软件建模与教学提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper describes the design, implementation and use of a new UML modeling
tool that represents a significant advance over conventional tools. Among other
things, it allows the integration of class diagrams and object diagrams as well
as the execution of objects. This not only enables new software architectures
characterized by the integration of software with corresponding object models,
but is also ideal for use in teaching, as it provides students with a
particularly stimulating learning experience. A special feature of the project
is that it has emerged from a long-standing international research project,

### [10] [A Scalable Unsupervised Framework for multi-aspect labeling of Multilingual and Multi-Domain Review Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09286)
*Jiin Park,Misuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多语言、可扩展且无监督的跨领域方面检测框架，用于多语言和多领域评论数据的多标签标注，实验证明其标签质量高且适用于训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于特定领域和语言，或依赖监督学习需要大量标注数据，为解决这些问题，提出了一个更通用的框架。

Method: 通过聚类提取方面类别候选，使用负采样生成方面感知嵌入向量，并评估自动生成标签的质量。

Result: 实验表明，生成的标签质量高，适用于训练，且框架在处理大规模数据时具有一致性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了监督方法的局限性，适用于多语言和多领域环境，未来将探索自动评论摘要和AI代理集成。

Abstract: Effectively analyzing online review data is essential across industries.
However, many existing studies are limited to specific domains and languages or
depend on supervised learning approaches that require large-scale labeled
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a multilingual, scalable,
and unsupervised framework for cross-domain aspect detection. This framework is
designed for multi-aspect labeling of multilingual and multi-domain review
data. In this study, we apply automatic labeling to Korean and English review
datasets spanning various domains and assess the quality of the generated
labels through extensive experiments. Aspect category candidates are first
extracted through clustering, and each review is then represented as an
aspect-aware embedding vector using negative sampling. To evaluate the
framework, we conduct multi-aspect labeling and fine-tune several pretrained
language models to measure the effectiveness of the automatically generated
labels. Results show that these models achieve high performance, demonstrating
that the labels are suitable for training. Furthermore, comparisons with
publicly available large language models highlight the framework's superior
consistency and scalability when processing large-scale data. A human
evaluation also confirms that the quality of the automatic labels is comparable
to those created manually. This study demonstrates the potential of a robust
multi-aspect labeling approach that overcomes limitations of supervised methods
and is adaptable to multilingual, multi-domain environments. Future research
will explore automatic review summarization and the integration of artificial
intelligence agents to further improve the efficiency and depth of review
analysis.

*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InForage是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态检索增强LLMs的推理能力，优于传统静态检索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态检索方法在复杂任务中的不足，利用动态检索适应模糊、多步骤或变化的信息需求。

Method: 基于信息觅食理论（IFT），提出InForage框架，通过强化学习动态优化检索行为，奖励中间检索质量。

Result: 在通用问答、多跳推理和实时网络问答任务中，InForage表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: InForage能构建高效、自适应且鲁棒的推理代理，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval has become a
standard method to address their inherent knowledge cutoff limitations.
However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static,
pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks
involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances
in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in
enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift
toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging
Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that
formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking
process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate
retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate
information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we
construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning
trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across
general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed
real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over
baseline methods. These results highlight InForage's effectiveness in building
robust, adaptive, and efficient reasoning agents.

### [12] [Llama See, Llama Do: A Mechanistic Perspective on Contextual Entrainment and Distraction in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09338)
*Jingcheng Niu,Xingdi Yuan,Tong Wang,Hamidreza Saghir,Amir H. Abdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现了一种新现象——上下文牵引（contextual entrainment），揭示了语言模型如何被输入提示中的无关信息分散注意力，并提出了相应的机制分析和缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在输入提示中如何被无关信息分散注意力，探索其背后的机制，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过统计分析和可微分掩码方法识别与上下文牵引现象相关的注意力头（entrainment heads），并通过关闭这些头来验证其影响。

Result: 发现上下文牵引是一种机制性现象，且受语义因素调节；关闭相关注意力头可显著减弱该现象。

Conclusion: 上下文牵引现象的发现及其机制分析为语言模型分心问题的解决提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: We observe a novel phenomenon, contextual entrainment, across a wide range of
language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic
perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual
information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher
logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the
context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual
entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the
relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the
sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of
contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual
prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while
contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic
factors.
  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment
heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a
novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we
identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,
i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is
significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates
to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery
of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via
the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and
mitigation of the distraction problem.

TL;DR: Qwen3是Qwen模型家族的最新版本，集成了密集和MoE架构，支持动态切换思维模式与非思维模式，并引入思维预算机制优化资源分配，在多语言能力和性能上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升语言模型的性能、效率和多语言能力，同时通过统一框架简化复杂推理与快速响应的切换。

Method: 采用密集和MoE架构，集成思维模式与非思维模式，引入思维预算机制，并利用旗舰模型知识优化小模型资源需求。

Result: 在代码生成、数学推理等任务上达到SOTA，支持119种语言，性能优于前代和同类模型。

Conclusion: Qwen3通过创新设计和资源优化，在多语言和任务性能上取得突破，开源以促进社区研究。

Abstract: In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family.
Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance
performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series
includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with
parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is
the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and
non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified
framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as
chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,
QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat
templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing
users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby
balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by
leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the
computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring
their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including
tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc.,
competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its
predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119
languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved
cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate
reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models
are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子计算在多语言机器翻译中的应用潜力，以替代现有的经典计算模型。

Method: 采用量子编码器-解码器架构，结合量子卷积、量子池化、量子变分电路和量子注意力机制。

Result: 在OPUS数据集上训练后，QEDACVC实现了82%的翻译准确率。

Conclusion: 量子计算在多语言翻译中具有潜力，QEDACVC为这一领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Cloud-based multilingual translation services like Google Translate and
Microsoft Translator achieve state-of-the-art translation capabilities. These
services inherently use large multilingual language models such as GRU, LSTM,
BERT, GPT, T5, or similar encoder-decoder architectures with attention
mechanisms as the backbone. Also, new age natural language systems, for
instance ChatGPT and DeepSeek, have established huge potential in multiple
tasks in natural language processing. At the same time, they also possess
outstanding multilingual translation capabilities. However, these models use
the classical computing realm as a backend. QEDACVC (Quantum Encoder Decoder
Attention-based Convolutional Variational Circuits) is an alternate solution
that explores the quantum computing realm instead of the classical computing
realm to study and demonstrate multilingual machine translation. QEDACVC
introduces the quantum encoder-decoder architecture that simulates and runs on
quantum computing hardware via quantum convolution, quantum pooling, quantum
variational circuit, and quantum attention as software alterations. QEDACVC
achieves an Accuracy of 82% when trained on the OPUS dataset for English,
French, German, and Hindi corpora for multilingual translations.

### [15] [PT-MoE: An Efficient Finetuning Framework for Integrating Mixture-of-Experts into Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09519)
*Zongqian Li,Yixuan Su,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PT-MoE框架结合矩阵分解和MoE路由，在参数高效微调中实现跨任务一致性和泛化能力，性能优于PT和LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在效率与性能不匹配的问题，PT-MoE旨在通过矩阵分解和MoE路由解决这一问题。

Method: PT-MoE整合矩阵分解与MoE路由，实现参数共享和动态适应。

Result: 在17个数据集上，PT-MoE在QA和数学任务中表现最优，参数减少25%。

Conclusion: PT-MoE展示了跨任务一致性和泛化能力，为未来PEFT方法提供新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have shown promise in adapting
large language models, yet existing approaches exhibit counter-intuitive
phenomena: integrating router into prompt tuning (PT) increases training
efficiency yet does not improve performance universally; parameter reduction
through matrix decomposition can improve performance in specific domains.
Motivated by these observations and the modular nature of PT, we propose
PT-MoE, a novel framework that integrates matrix decomposition with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing for efficient PT. Results across 17 datasets
demonstrate that PT-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both question
answering (QA) and mathematical problem solving tasks, improving F1 score by
1.49 points over PT and 2.13 points over LoRA in QA tasks, while enhancing
mathematical accuracy by 10.75 points over PT and 0.44 points over LoRA, all
while using 25% fewer parameters than LoRA. Our analysis reveals that while PT
methods generally excel in QA tasks and LoRA-based methods in math datasets,
the integration of matrix decomposition and MoE in PT-MoE yields complementary
benefits: decomposition enables efficient parameter sharing across experts
while MoE provides dynamic adaptation, collectively enabling PT-MoE to
demonstrate cross-task consistency and generalization abilities. These
findings, along with ablation studies on routing mechanisms and architectural
components, provide insights for future PEFT methods.

*Abdullah Mushtaq,Imran Taj,Rafay Naeem,Ibrahim Ghaznavi,Junaid Qadir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出WorldView-Bench基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的全球文化包容性（GCI），通过多视角方法减少西方中心主义偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs训练和评估方式强化了西方中心主义，导致文化同质化，缺乏全球多样性。现有基准框架未能充分捕捉这种偏见。

Method: 基于Multiplex Worldview理论，提出两种干预策略：上下文实现的多视角LLMs和多代理系统（MAS）实现的多视角LLMs。通过自由生成评估文化极化。

Result: MAS实现的多视角LLMs将视角分布分数（PDS）熵从13%提升至94%，情感正向性达67.7%，文化平衡性显著增强。

Conclusion: 多视角评估方法能有效减少LLMs的文化偏见，推动更具包容性和伦理对齐的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly trained and aligned in ways
that reinforce Western-centric epistemologies and socio-cultural norms, leading
to cultural homogenization and limiting their ability to reflect global
civilizational plurality. Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately
capture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook
the complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce
WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity
(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our
approach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,
which distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural
homogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.
WorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative
perspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional
categorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two
intervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where
system prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System
(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing
distinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results
demonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)
entropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,
alongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural
balance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI
evaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more
inclusive and ethically aligned AI systems.

### [17] [Deep reinforcement learning-based longitudinal control strategy for automated vehicles at signalised intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08896)
*Pankaj Kumar,Aditya Mishra,Pranamesh Chakraborty,Subrahmanya Swamy Peruru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的纵向车辆控制策略，用于信号交叉口（SI）的自动驾驶车辆控制。通过结合真实和模拟轨迹数据训练模型，结果表明该方法在效率、安全性和舒适性方面优于人类驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号交叉口的自动驾驶车辆控制因其复杂的决策过程而具有挑战性，需要一种高效且安全的控制策略。

Method: 研究采用深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）和软演员-评论家（SAC）两种DRL算法，结合综合奖励函数（包括效率、决策和加速度响应）进行训练。

Result: RL模型在保持较低车距和抖动的同时，未牺牲安全性，且在安全关键场景中表现稳健。DDPG模型的动作更平滑。

Conclusion: 基于DRL的纵向控制策略可提升信号交叉口的交通安全性、效率和舒适性。

Abstract: Developing an autonomous vehicle control strategy for signalised
intersections (SI) is one of the challenging tasks due to its inherently
complex decision-making process. This study proposes a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI. A
comprehensive reward function has been formulated with a particular focus on
(i) distance headway-based efficiency reward, (ii) decision-making criteria
during amber light, and (iii) asymmetric acceleration/ deceleration response,
along with the traditional safety and comfort criteria. This reward function
has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the
continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have
been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories
and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process.
The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory
data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance
headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles
without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed
models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical
scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG
and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG
model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model. Overall, the
results confirm that DRL-based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI can
help to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and comfort.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化构建基于事实的合成数据模型评估方法，利用语言模型（LMs）自动评估领域知识，仅需基础文档输入。该方法与人工构建的评估高度相关（Spearman相关性0.96），并支持生成多项选择和开放式问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人工构建评估基准的局限性无法跟上模型规模和范围的快速增长，且难以覆盖所有领域，因此需要一种自动化方法。

Method: 利用语言模型自动生成基于文档的合成数据评估问题，包括多项选择和开放式问题。

Result: 该方法与人工构建的评估高度相关（Spearman相关性0.96，Pearson准确性相关性0.79），并在Gemma3模型上表现出色。

Conclusion: 自动化合成数据评估方法有效且高效，能够替代或补充人工评估，为模型能力提供诊断性洞察。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) continue to advance, improving response quality and
coherence. Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered
much of what users might ask them to generate in some form during their
training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess
model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However,
the human effort required for benchmark construction is limited and being
rapidly outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation.
Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of
interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the
construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in
document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate
domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g.,
a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds
well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96
and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79. This novel
tool supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data
questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this
methodology to evaluate model performance on a recent relevant arXiv preprint,
discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma3 models.

### [19] [Generalization in Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08988)
*Montaser Mohammedalamen,Michael Bowling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了在奖励不可观测的监控马尔可夫决策过程（Mon-MDP）中，如何通过函数近似（FA）和奖励模型实现策略的泛化，并提出了解决过度泛化问题的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中奖励通常不可观测，而现有Mon-MDP研究局限于简单表格化情况，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合函数近似和奖励模型，从可观测奖励的状态泛化到不可观测奖励的状态，并提出基于奖励不确定性的谨慎策略优化方法。

Result: 研究表明，该方法能在理论上无法解决的环境中实现接近最优策略，但也发现函数近似可能导致过度泛化问题。

Conclusion: 通过奖励模型和谨慎优化方法，论文为Mon-MDP理论与实际应用的结合提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) typically models the interaction between the
agent and environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the rewards
that guide the agent's behavior are always observable. However, in many
real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled
as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have
been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to
real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation
(FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function
approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from
monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states
with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization
with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally
defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such
function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to
overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate
overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging
reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap
between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.

Motivation: 研究如何在复杂多智能体系统中实现高效决策，同时解决飞行动力学、状态和动作空间爆炸等问题。

Method: 将决策分为两层：低层策略控制单个单位，高层指挥官策略发布宏观命令。通过课程学习和分层训练优化策略。

Result: 实证验证表明，该框架能有效解决复杂多智能体系统中的决策问题。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习框架在模拟空战场景中表现出色，为现实防御应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This work presents a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
framework for analyzing simulated air combat scenarios involving heterogeneous
agents. The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to
mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of
real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting.
Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges,
such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action
spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time
control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these
challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of
abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level
commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission
targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by
exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control
from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat
control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is
then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The
empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统中的多级级联故障可能导致电网崩溃，现有策略多为单级，忽略了多级场景的复杂性。

Method: 将多级级联故障问题建模为强化学习任务，开发仿真环境，并使用确定性策略梯度算法训练智能体。

Result: 在IEEE 14和118总线系统上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的强化学习方法能有效应对多级级联故障问题。

Abstract: Cascading failures in power grids can lead to grid collapse, causing severe
disruptions to social operations and economic activities. In certain cases,
multi-stage cascading failures can occur. However, existing
cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based,
overlooking the complexity of the multi-stage scenario. This paper treats the
multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and
develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then
trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous
actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on
the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.

Motivation: 解决人类心理预期与LLM生成内容之间的对齐问题，提升内容质量。

Method: 采用代理强化学习技术，通过LLM作为法官（LLMaaJ）指导另一LLM，利用上下文学习生成内容，并解读预期和非预期的文本特征。

Result: 实验显示，人类内容审核者的预期与AI生成内容对齐率为53.8%，平均迭代次数为4.38。内容质量提升，网球动作覆盖范围扩大。

Conclusion: 该方法成功应用于2024年美国网球公开赛，并在其他体育和娱乐活动中推广，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a method of meta-prompting that jointly produces fluent text for
complex tasks while optimizing the similarity of neural states between a
human's mental expectation and a Large Language Model's (LLM) neural
processing. A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which
an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning,
how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated
text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users
modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open
2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM)
alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation
of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results
of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had
100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of
4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness,
novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines
spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait
relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an
increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action. Our
work that was deployed at the US Open 2024 has been used across other live
events within sports and entertainment.

TL;DR: MCBS结合光束搜索和蒙特卡洛方法改进TD3的探索和动作选择，提升样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TD3依赖噪声探索，可能导致策略收敛不理想，MCBS旨在通过结构化前瞻搜索优化策略学习。

Method: MCBS生成多个候选动作并通过短视界评估，结合光束搜索和蒙特卡洛方法。

Result: 在多个连续控制基准测试中，MCBS表现优于TD3、SAC、PPO和A2C，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: MCBS通过结构化前瞻搜索提升策略学习效率，同时保持计算高效性。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods, like Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(TD3), depend on basic noise-based exploration, which can result in less than
optimal policy convergence. In this study, we introduce Monte Carlo Beam Search
(MCBS), a new hybrid method that combines beam search and Monte Carlo rollouts
with TD3 to improve exploration and action selection. MCBS produces several
candidate actions around the policy's output and assesses them through
short-horizon rollouts, enabling the agent to make better-informed choices. We
test MCBS across various continuous-control benchmarks, including
HalfCheetah-v4, Walker2d-v5, and Swimmer-v5, showing enhanced sample efficiency
and performance compared to standard TD3 and other baseline methods like SAC,
PPO, and A2C. Our findings emphasize MCBS's capability to enhance policy
learning through structured look-ahead search while ensuring computational
efficiency. Additionally, we offer a detailed analysis of crucial
hyperparameters, such as beam width and rollout depth, and explore adaptive
strategies to optimize MCBS for complex control tasks. Our method shows a
higher convergence rate across different environments compared to TD3, SAC,
PPO, and A2C. For instance, we achieved 90% of the maximum achievable reward
within around 200 thousand timesteps compared to 400 thousand timesteps for the
second-best method.

Motivation: 大语言模型在生成信息时存在幻觉问题，即生成自信但错误或不相关的内容。尽管思维链（CoT）提示在多步推理中表现良好，但单独使用仍无法完全解决幻觉问题。

Method: 结合CoT与RAG，并应用自一致性和自验证策略，通过引入外部知识源和模型自我验证机制，生成更准确和连贯的响应。

Result: 通过比较基线LLMs与CoT、CoT+RAG、自一致性和自验证技术，研究展示了每种方法的有效性，并确定了最稳健的减少幻觉的方法。

Conclusion: 结合CoT与RAG及自验证策略能有效减少幻觉，同时保持生成内容的流畅性和推理深度。

Abstract: Hallucination, where large language models (LLMs) generate confident but
incorrect or irrelevant information, remains a key limitation in their
application to complex, open-ended tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding
models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address
the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and
self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual
accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and
enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more
accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of
baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification
techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify
the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency
and reasoning depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，离线数据集通常缺乏高质量和最优行为数据，导致DT性能受限。

Method: 提出反事实推理决策变换器（CRDT），通过生成和利用反事实经验来增强决策能力。

Result: 在Atari和D4RL基准测试中，CRDT在数据有限和动态变化场景下表现优于传统DT。

Conclusion: 反事实推理能显著提升强化学习代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement
learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across
various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to
perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and
the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets
challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we
propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel
framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to
reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual
experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments
across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and
altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches.
Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain
stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural
modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual
reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and
generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 研究旨在验证大型模型（如GPT-4-turbo）在合作任务中的表现，并探讨其在不同架构和规模模型中的通用性，以及新场景下的适应性。

Method: 通过复制关键实验并引入新模型（如DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o-mini）、新场景（如异质多智能体环境和日语指令场景）以及新任务（如“逆向环境”），评估模型的合作行为。

Conclusion: 研究证实了GovSim框架的广泛适用性，为复杂合作任务中LLMs的适应性提供了重要见解，并对高效利用计算资源和开发更有效的合作AI系统具有潜在意义。

Abstract: This study evaluates and extends the findings made by Piatti et al., who
introduced GovSim, a simulation framework designed to assess the cooperative
decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
resource-sharing scenarios. By replicating key experiments, we validate claims
regarding the performance of large models, such as GPT-4-turbo, compared to
smaller models. The impact of the universalization principle is also examined,
with results showing that large models can achieve sustainable cooperation,
with or without the principle, while smaller models fail without it. In
addition, we provide multiple extensions to explore the applicability of the
framework to new settings. We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3
and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across
different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new
settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario
using Japanese instructions, and explore an "inverse environment" where agents
must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm
that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages,
offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative
tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems
demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to
adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other
agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of
computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective
cooperative AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统面临双重用途困境，仅基于请求内容决策会导致误判合法查询或放过有害请求。

Method: 提出基于验证用户凭证和风险分类的访问控制框架，采用小规模专家模块集成生成模型，通过梯度路由训练实现高效风险检测。

Result: 框架初步实现了对AI能力的细粒度治理，合法用户可获取专业知识，而恶意用户被阻止。

Conclusion: 该上下文方法在模型效用与安全性之间取得平衡，解决了双重用途问题。

Abstract: AI safety systems face a dual-use dilemma. Since the same request can be
either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why, if the system
makes decisions based solely on the request's content, it will refuse some
legitimate queries and let pass harmful ones. To address this, we propose a
conceptual access control framework, based on verified user credentials (such
as institutional affiliation) and classifiers that assign model outputs to risk
categories (such as advanced virology). The system permits responses only when
the user's verified credentials match the category's requirements. For
implementation of the model output classifiers, we introduce a theoretical
approach utilizing small, gated expert modules integrated into the generator
model, trained with gradient routing, that enable efficient risk detection
without the capability gap problems of external monitors. While open questions
remain about the verification mechanisms, risk categories, and the technical
implementation, our framework makes the first step toward enabling granular
governance of AI capabilities: verified users gain access to specialized
knowledge without arbitrary restrictions, while adversaries are blocked from
it. This contextual approach reconciles model utility with robust safety,
addressing the dual-use dilemma.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial

about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning,
particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role
of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by
evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured
LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework.
Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human
participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based
objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess
agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis,
covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that
human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with
human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design
complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence
on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural
augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在四个真实数据集上验证了方法的实用性，展示了其在复杂序列决策任务中的可行性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为序列决策任务中的反事实分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Counterfactuals are widely used in AI to explain how minimal changes to a
model's input can lead to a different output. However, established methods for
computing counterfactuals typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are
not directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This paper fills
this gap by introducing counterfactual strategies for Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). During MDP execution, a strategy decides which of the enabled actions
(with known probabilistic effects) to execute next. Given an initial strategy
that reaches an undesired outcome with a probability above some limit, we
identify minimal changes to the initial strategy to reduce that probability
below the limit. We encode such counterfactual strategies as solutions to
non-linear optimization problems, and further extend our encoding to synthesize
diverse counterfactual strategies. We evaluate our approach on four real-world
datasets and demonstrate its practical viability in sophisticated sequential
decision-making tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对隐藏模型POMDP（HM-POMDP）的鲁棒策略计算方法，结合形式验证和梯度上升技术，显著提升了策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POMDP的最优策略在环境扰动下可能不鲁棒，HM-POMDP通过捕捉一组潜在环境模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合形式验证（计算最坏情况POMDP）和梯度上升（优化策略），生成鲁棒策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基线更鲁棒，泛化能力更强，并能扩展到包含数十万环境的HM-POMDP。

Conclusion: 该方法为HM-POMDP提供了一种高效且可扩展的鲁棒策略生成方案。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific
environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically,
optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the
environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different
environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space.
The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models,
and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A
policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for
each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal
techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports
tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the
HM-POMDP and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a
worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various
baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and
generalize better to unseen POMDPs and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of
over a hundred thousand environments.

TL;DR: 语言模型（LM）代理在探索和理解因果关系时表现出系统性的‘析取偏差’，尤其在复杂任务中表现更差。研究发现LM的推理模式与成人相似，并提出一种测试时采样方法以减少偏差。


<details>

Motivation: 研究LM是否具备探索和推断因果关系的能力，以及是否存在系统性偏差，以推动LM在科学推理中的应用。

Method: 采用发展心理学中的‘Blicket Test’范式，评估LM在不同因果关系中的表现，并提出测试时采样方法以减少偏差。

Result: LM在常见的析取因果关系中表现良好，但在合取因果关系中表现不佳，且偏差随任务复杂性增加而加剧。LM的推理模式与成人相似。

Conclusion: LM存在析取偏差，但通过测试时采样方法可显著减少偏差，推动LM在因果推理中的科学应用。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous
decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their
decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient
exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to
robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs
possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous
conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal
relationships, using the well-established "Blicket Test" paradigm from
developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive
disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual,
yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This
"disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting
strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases.
Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs
may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data.
To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs
exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we
propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates
hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach
significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of
scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

Result: 发现现有文献中对交叉性理论的应用存在偏差，削弱了其潜在影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁更准确地应用交叉性理论，以实现更公平的机器学习技术。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a go-to solution for improving how we use,
experience, and interact with technology (and the world around us).
Unfortunately, studies have repeatedly shown that machine learning technologies
may not provide adequate support for societal identities and experiences.
Intersectionality is a sociological framework that provides a mechanism for
explicitly considering complex social identities, focusing on social justice
and power. While the framework of intersectionality can support the development
of technologies that acknowledge and support all members of society, it has
been adopted and adapted in ways that are not always true to its foundations,
thereby weakening its potential for impact. To support the appropriate adoption
and use of intersectionality for more equitable technological outcomes, we
amplify the foundational intersectionality scholarship--Crenshaw, Combahee, and
Collins (three C's), to create a socially relevant preliminary framework in
developing machine-learning solutions. We use this framework to evaluate and
report on the (mis)alignments of intersectionality application in machine
learning literature.

Abstract: Onboard learning is a transformative approach in edge AI, enabling real-time
data processing, decision-making, and adaptive model training directly on
resource-constrained devices without relying on centralized servers. This
paradigm is crucial for applications demanding low latency, enhanced privacy,

limited computational resources, high inference costs, and security
vulnerabilities. This survey explores a comprehensive range of methodologies
that address these challenges, focusing on techniques that optimize model
efficiency, accelerate inference, and support collaborative learning across
distributed devices. Approaches for reducing model complexity, improving
inference speed, and ensuring privacy-preserving computation are examined
alongside emerging strategies that enhance scalability and adaptability in
dynamic environments. By bridging advancements in hardware-software co-design,
model compression, and decentralized learning, this survey provides insights
into the current state of onboard learning to enable robust, efficient, and
secure AI deployment at the edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索离散数据（如WordNet）的几何表示，揭示层次意义本身的几何本质。

Method: 基于局部层次信号（定向标记对），无需全局符号结构，应用于WordNet语料库。

Result: 完美嵌入哺乳动物子树及最大无歧义子集（82,115名词标记），层次结构完全几何化。

Conclusion: 离散数据存在完美三维几何表示，层次意义本质上是几何的，与广义相对论和场论有深层联系。

Abstract: We show that there is a fast algorithm that embeds hierarchical structures in
three-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The correlation of data ends up purely
encoded in the causal structure. Our model relies solely on oriented token
pairs -- local hierarchical signals -- with no access to global symbolic
structure. We apply our method to the corpus of \textit{WordNet}. We provide a
perfect embedding of the mammal sub-tree including ambiguities (more than one
hierarchy per node) in such a way that the hierarchical structures get
completely codified in the geometry and exactly reproduce the ground-truth. We
extend this to a perfect embedding of the maximal unambiguous subset of the
\textit{WordNet} with 82{,}115 noun tokens and a single hierarchy per token. We
introduce a novel retrieval mechanism in which causality, not distance, governs
hierarchical access. Our results seem to indicate that all discrete data has a
perfect geometrical representation that is three-dimensional. The resulting
embeddings are nearly conformally invariant, indicating deep connections with
general relativity and field theory. These results suggest that concepts,
categories, and their interrelations, namely hierarchical meaning itself, is
geometric.

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注单模态生成模型的崩溃风险，而多模态AI系统在现实场景中更为常见，需进一步探索其崩溃特性及解决方案。

Method: 将研究扩展到多模态视觉-语言生成系统（如VLMs和文本-图像扩散模型），并分析递归生成-训练循环中的崩溃现象。

Result: 多模态模型崩溃表现出独特特征（如视觉-语言对齐改善），并发现解码预算增加、模型多样性等方法可有效缓解崩溃。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态AI系统的自改进和合成数据集的稳健性提供了初步见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where
performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated
data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single,
unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such
as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic
data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model
collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as
vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as
recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model
collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits
distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved
vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task.
Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding
budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can
effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and
practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving
multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过RMS归一化和渐进量化策略，将全精度大语言模型稳定量化为三值（2位）模型的方法，无需额外训练或模型复杂度提升，性能接近全精度模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的实际部署成本高，量化虽能减少内存和计算需求，但会降低精度，而量化感知训练虽能恢复性能但需要额外训练。三值量化虽能进一步节省资源，但稳定性差。

Method: 在每层线性投影前插入RMS归一化，并采用渐进、分层量化策略，将全精度检查点稳定微调为三值LLMs。

Result: 该方法在标准语言建模基准测试中表现优于或接近复杂的知识蒸馏流程，且未增加模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅通过精心设计的归一化即可缩小三值与全精度LLMs之间的精度差距，使超低比特推理变得实用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural-language processing,
yet their scale makes real-world deployment costly. Post-training quantization
reduces memory and computation but often degrades accuracy, while
quantization-aware training can recover performance at the cost of extra
training. Pushing quantization to the ternary (2-bit) regime yields even larger
savings but is notoriously unstable. Building on recent work showing that a
bias-free, RMS-normalized Transformer with straight-through estimation can
reach 1.58-bit precision, we demonstrate that simply inserting RMS
normalization before every linear projection and applying a gradual, layer-wise
quantization schedule stably fine-tunes full-precision checkpoints into ternary
LLMs. Our approach matches or surpasses more elaborate knowledge-distillation
pipelines on standard language-modeling benchmarks without adding model
complexity. These results indicate that careful normalization alone can close
much of the accuracy gap between ternary and full-precision LLMs, making
ultra-low-bit inference practical.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在无参考解决方案情况下的自我改进能力，解决传统强化学习中奖励信号难以生成的问题。

Method: 通过自我评判机制，模型生成问题、解决问题并自我评估，结合合成问题生成形成闭环。

Result: 在Countdown谜题和MIT积分问题上性能提升8%，超越GPT-4o表现。

Conclusion: 自我评判为强化学习提供有效奖励信号，预示AI系统可通过自主学习持续改进，加速数据稀缺或复杂评估领域的进展。

Abstract: We demonstrate that large language models can effectively self-improve
through self-judging without requiring reference solutions, leveraging the
inherent asymmetry between generating and verifying solutions. Our experiments
on Countdown puzzles and MIT Integration Bee problems show that models can
provide reliable reward signals without ground truth answers, enabling
reinforcement learning in domains previously not possible. By implementing
self-judging, we achieve significant performance gains maintaining alignment
with formal verification. When combined with synthetic question generation, we
establish a complete self-improvement loop where models generate practice
problems, solve them, and evaluate their own performance-achieving an 8%
improvement with Qwen 2.5 7B over baseline and surpassing GPT-4o performance on
integration tasks. Our findings demonstrate that LLM judges can provide
effective reward signals for training models, unlocking many reinforcement
learning environments previously limited by the difficulty of creating
programmatic rewards. This suggests a potential paradigm shift toward AI
systems that continuously improve through self-directed learning rather than
human-guided training, potentially accelerating progress in domains with scarce
training data or complex evaluation requirements.

Motivation: 随着AI预测算法的普及，如何在准确性和公平性之间取得平衡成为重要问题，但目前缺乏明确的规范指导。

Method: 通过线性组合准确性和公平性指标，结合Harsanyi的偏好聚合理论，提出一种度量算法价值的方法。

Result: 论证了线性组合方法的合理性，并在COMPAS数据集上分析了准确性与公平性的权衡。

Conclusion: 线性组合方法为解决准确性与公平性的权衡提供了理论支持，适用于同时关注两者的场景。

Abstract: An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will
almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting
accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In
addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about
by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on
building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their
predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain
individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual
challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in
tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the
trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many
distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive
algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our
preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of
fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address
these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear
combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the
all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about
both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result
in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this
formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness
trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.

Motivation: 时间序列数据对人类不直观，需要简化以提高可解释性。

Method: 引入复杂度（分段数量）和忠诚度（保持分类的可能性）指标，评估四种简化算法在不同TSC算法和数据集上的表现。

Result: 简化方法在季节性、非平稳和低熵时间序列中显著优于原始数据。

Conclusion: 简化时间序列在TSC可解释性中具有优势，特别是在特定数据特征下。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time
series in the context of interpretability of a TSC - a Time Series Classifier.
Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to
text and image data, are not intuitively understandable to humans. These
metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications - how many
segments they contain - and to their loyalty - how likely they are to maintain
the classification of the original time series. We employ these metrics to
evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms
and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to
short or long. Our findings suggest that using simplifications for
interpretability of TSC is much better than using the original time series,
particularly when the time series are seasonal, non-stationary and/or with low
entropy.

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep
neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms,
hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably
low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability
distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of
deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon
for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the
geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate
of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii)
the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning
of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically
computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize
phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also
extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with
stochastic gradient descent.

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型简单性、可解释性和泛化能力之间的权衡，并指出了在Kaggle式竞赛框架下商业驱动方法的约束。

Abstract: The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through spectral analysis is
a complex challenge. The NeurIPS 2024 Ariel Data Challenge, in collaboration
with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariel mission, provided an opportunity
to explore machine learning techniques for extracting atmospheric compositions
from simulated spectral data. In this work, we focus on a data-centric business
approach, prioritizing generalization over competition-specific optimization.
We briefly outline multiple experimental axes, including feature extraction,
signal transformation, and heteroskedastic uncertainty modeling. Our
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation plays a crucial role in the
Gaussian Log-Likelihood (GLL) score, impacting performance by several
percentage points. Despite improving the GLL score by 11%, our results
highlight the inherent limitations of tabular modeling and feature engineering
for this task, as well as the constraints of a business-driven approach within
a Kaggle-style competition framework. Our findings emphasize the trade-offs
between model simplicity, interpretability, and generalization in astrophysical

been explored for this purpose, and the state-of-the-art implementations were
built upon the best of a few limited options. In this paper, we present a
generalized method for building an SSM with any frame or basis, rather than
being restricted to polynomials. This framework encompasses the approach known
as HiPPO, but also permits an infinite diversity of other possible "species"
within the SSM architecture. We dub this approach SaFARi: SSMs for
Frame-Agnostic Representation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过指数遗忘平衡回归模型的方法，解决了未知线性随机系统在线预测中的过拟合问题，并提供了更优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知线性随机系统的在线预测中，现有方法（如递归最小二乘法）可能因回归模型不平衡导致过拟合和预测性能下降。

Method: 通过指数遗忘技术注入归纳偏置，平衡回归模型，优化回归与正则化误差的权衡，并减少累积误差。

Result: 实现了更好的预测性能，并提供了更优的遗憾界（O(log^3 N)）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过平衡回归模型，显著提升了在线预测的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction for an unknown, non-explosive
linear stochastic system. With a known system model, the optimal predictor is
the celebrated Kalman filter. In the case of unknown systems, existing
approaches based on recursive least squares and its variants may suffer from
degraded performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of the regression
model. This imbalance can easily lead to overfitting and thus degrade
prediction accuracy. We tackle this problem by injecting an inductive bias into
the regression model via {exponential forgetting}. While exponential forgetting
is a common wisdom in online learning, it is typically used for re-weighting
data. In contrast, our approach focuses on balancing the regression model. This
achieves a better trade-off between {regression} and {regularization errors},
and simultaneously reduces the {accumulation error}. With new proof techniques,
we also provide a sharper logarithmic regret bound of $O(\log^3 N)$, where $N$
is the number of observations.

Motivation: 持续学习在强化学习中面临挑战，特别是在没有外部信号指示任务或环境变化时如何保留和利用现有信息。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在没有外部信号的情况下实现持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Continual learning for reinforcement learning agents remains a significant
challenge, particularly in preserving and leveraging existing information
without an external signal to indicate changes in tasks or environments. In
this study, we explore the effectiveness of autoencoders in detecting new tasks
and matching observed environments to previously encountered ones. Our approach
integrates policy optimization with familiarity autoencoders within an
end-to-end continual learning system. This system can recognize and learn new
tasks or environments while preserving knowledge from earlier experiences and
can selectively retrieve relevant knowledge when re-encountering a known
environment. Initial results demonstrate successful continual learning without
external signals to indicate task changes or reencounters, showing promise for
this methodology.

Motivation: 为临床决策提供可重复的转移性骨病监测工具，尤其是针对APC患者。

Method: 结合弱监督Residual U-Net模型、统计框架和浅层卷积神经网络，生成骨骼概率图和病变掩膜。

Conclusion: 该软件为转移性骨病的监测提供了高效、可重复的量化工具，适用于临床决策。

Abstract: We developed an AI-driven software solution to quantify metastatic bone
disease from WB-DWI scans. Core technologies include: (i) a weakly-supervised
Residual U-Net model generating a skeleton probability map to isolate bone;
(ii) a statistical framework for WB-DWI intensity normalisation, obtaining a
signal-normalised b=900s/mm^2 (b900) image; and (iii) a shallow convolutional
neural network that processes outputs from (i) and (ii) to generate a mask of
suspected bone lesions, characterised by higher b900 signal intensity due to
restricted water diffusion. This mask is applied to the gADC map to extract TDV
and gADC statistics. We tested the tool using expert-defined metastatic bone
disease delineations on 66 datasets, assessed repeatability of imaging
biomarkers (N=10), and compared software-based response assessment with a
construct reference standard based on clinical, laboratory and imaging
assessments (N=118). Dice score between manual and automated delineations was
0.6 for lesions within pelvis and spine, with an average surface distance of
2mm. Relative differences for log-transformed TDV (log-TDV) and median gADC
were below 9% and 5%, respectively. Repeatability analysis showed coefficients
of variation of 4.57% for log-TDV and 3.54% for median gADC, with intraclass
correlation coefficients above 0.9. The software achieved 80.5% accuracy, 84.3%
sensitivity, and 85.7% specificity in assessing response to treatment compared
to the construct reference standard. Computation time generating a mask
averaged 90 seconds per scan. Our software enables reproducible TDV and gADC
quantification from WB-DWI scans for monitoring metastatic bone disease
response, thus providing potentially useful measurements for clinical
decision-making in APC patients.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DyGSSM的新方法，结合GCN和GRU提取动态图的局部和全局特征，并利用HiPPO算法优化参数更新，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图表示学习方法未能同时提取局部和全局信息，且参数更新时未考虑当前快照的性能，导致时间依赖性管理不足。

Method: 结合GCN提取局部特征和GRU提取全局特征，通过交叉注意力机制整合，并利用HiPPO算法优化SSM模型参数更新。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上，DyGSSM在20个案例中的17个优于现有基线方法和SOTA方法。

Conclusion: DyGSSM通过多视角特征提取和HiPPO算法优化，显著提升了动态图表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Most of the dynamic graph representation learning methods involve dividing a
dynamic graph into discrete snapshots to capture the evolving behavior of nodes
over time. Existing methods primarily capture only local or global structures
of each node within a snapshot using message-passing and random walk-based
methods. Then, they utilize sequence-based models (e.g., transformers) to
encode the temporal evolution of node embeddings, and meta-learning techniques
to update the model parameters. However, these approaches have two limitations.
First, they neglect the extraction of global and local information
simultaneously in each snapshot. Second, they fail to consider the model's
performance in the current snapshot during parameter updates, resulting in a
lack of temporal dependency management. Recently, HiPPO (High-order Polynomial
Projection Operators) algorithm has gained attention for their ability to
optimize and preserve sequence history in State Space Model (SSM). To address
the aforementioned limitations in dynamic graph representation learning, we
propose a novel method called Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State
Space Model Gradient Update (DyGSSM). Our approach combines Graph Convolution
Networks (GCN) for local feature extraction and random walk with Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) for global feature extraction in each snapshot. We then
integrate the local and global features using a cross-attention mechanism.
Additionally, we incorporate an SSM based on HiPPO algorithm to account for
long-term dependencies when updating model parameters, ensuring that model
performance in each snapshot informs subsequent updates. Experiments on five
public datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline and
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 17 out of 20 cases.

TL;DR: Mamba扩展了状态空间模型（SSMs），但长序列任务表现不佳。通过分析表达力、归纳偏差和训练稳定性，提出改进方法B2S6，性能优于S4和S4D。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba在长序列任务中表现不佳，限制了其通用性。研究旨在理解并解决这一问题。

Method: 从表达力、归纳偏差和训练稳定性三个角度分析Mamba的不足，并提出改进方法B2S6。

Result: B2S6在长序列任务（LRA）上优于S4和S4D，同时在语言建模任务中保持Mamba的性能。

Conclusion: B2S6通过改进Mamba的S6单元，提升了模型在长序列任务中的表现，增强了其通用性。

Abstract: Mamba extends earlier state space models (SSMs) by introducing
input-dependent dynamics, and has demonstrated strong empirical performance
across a range of domains, including language modeling, computer vision, and
foundation models. However, a surprising weakness remains: despite being built
on architectures designed for long-range dependencies, Mamba performs poorly on
long-range sequential tasks. Understanding and addressing this gap is important
for improving Mamba's universality and versatility. In this work, we analyze
Mamba's limitations through three perspectives: expressiveness, inductive bias,
and training stability. Our theoretical results show how Mamba falls short in
each of these aspects compared to earlier SSMs such as S4D. To address these
issues, we propose $\text{B}_2\text{S}_6$, a simple extension of Mamba's S6
unit that combines block-wise selective dynamics with a channel-specific bias.
We prove that these changes equip the model with a better-suited inductive bias
and improve its expressiveness and stability. Empirically,
$\text{B}_2\text{S}_6$ outperforms S4 and S4D on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks
while maintaining Mamba's performance on language modeling benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统方法需要迭代时间步进，效率低且计算成本高。Flexi-VAE旨在通过神经传播器在变分自编码器（VAE）中直接预测未来状态，提高效率和稳定性。

Method: Flexi-VAE结合了神经传播器（DCP和PEP两种策略）来推进潜在表示的时间演化，并通过几何诊断（如雅可比谱分析）验证潜在空间的稳定性和物理意义。

Result: 在1D粘性Burgers方程和2D对流扩散方程等基准测试中，Flexi-VAE实现了高精度预测，并显著提升了计算效率（CPU 50倍，GPU 90倍加速）。

Conclusion: Flexi-VAE是一种可扩展且可解释的替代建模工具，适用于计算流体动力学（CFD）等参数PDE驱动的应用，并具有扩展到更高维和更复杂系统的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Flexi-VAE, a data-driven framework for efficient single-shot
forecasting of nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs),
eliminating the need for iterative time-stepping while maintaining high
accuracy and stability. Flexi-VAE incorporates a neural propagator that
advances latent representations forward in time, aligning latent evolution with
physical state reconstruction in a variational autoencoder setting. We evaluate
two propagation strategies, the Direct Concatenation Propagator (DCP) and the
Positional Encoding Propagator (PEP), and demonstrate, through
representation-theoretic analysis, that DCP offers superior long-term
generalization by fostering disentangled and physically meaningful latent
spaces. Geometric diagnostics, including Jacobian spectral analysis, reveal
that propagated latent states reside in regions of lower decoder sensitivity
and more stable local geometry than those derived via direct encoding,
enhancing robustness for long-horizon predictions. We validate Flexi-VAE on
canonical PDE benchmarks, the 1D viscous Burgers equation and the 2D
advection-diffusion equation, achieving accurate forecasts across wide
parametric ranges. The model delivers over 50x CPU and 90x GPU speedups
compared to autoencoder-LSTM baselines for large temporal shifts. These results
position Flexi-VAE as a scalable and interpretable surrogate modeling tool for
accelerating high-fidelity simulations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
and other parametric PDE-driven applications, with extensibility to
higher-dimensional and more complex systems.

Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型在快速衰落信道和低信噪比场景下性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合卷积层（捕捉局部相关性）和Transformer编码器（全局注意力机制），并整合非线性信道统计先验信息。

Result: 在多种测试条件下，AdaFortiTran实现了比现有模型高达6 dB的MSE降低，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaFortiTran在复杂信道环境下具有显著优势，为OFDM系统的信道估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) systems often suffer from performance degradation under
fast-fading channels and low-SNR scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce the Adaptive Fortified Transformer (AdaFortiTran), a novel model
specifically designed to enhance channel estimation in challenging
environments. Our approach employs convolutional layers that exploit locality
bias to capture strong correlations between neighboring channel elements,
combined with a transformer encoder that applies the global Attention mechanism
to channel patches. This approach effectively models both long-range
dependencies and spectro-temporal interactions within single OFDM frames. We
further augment the model's adaptability by integrating nonlinear
representations of available channel statistics SNR, delay spread, and Doppler
shift as priors. A residual connection is employed to merge global features
from the transformer with local features from early convolutional processing,
followed by final convolutional layers to refine the hierarchical channel
representation. Despite its compact architecture, AdaFortiTran achieves up to 6
dB reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models.
Tested across a wide range of Doppler shifts (200-1000 Hz), SNRs (0 to 25 dB),
and delay spreads (50-300 ns), it demonstrates superior robustness in
high-mobility environments.

Conclusion: 人类参与的监督学习能有效增强大型模型的复杂认知能力，为开发更接近人类认知的人工系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large-scale
language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and natural
language understanding. Although scaling up model parameters with increasing
volume of training data has progressively improved DNN capabilities, achieving
complex cognitive abilities - such as understanding abstract concepts,
reasoning, and adapting to novel scenarios, which are intrinsic to human
cognition - remains a major challenge. In this study, we show that
brain-in-the-loop supervised learning, utilizing a small set of brain signals,
can effectively transfer human conceptual structures to DNNs, significantly
enhancing their comprehension of abstract and even unseen concepts.
Experimental results further indicate that the enhanced cognitive capabilities
lead to substantial performance gains in challenging tasks, including
few-shot/zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution recognition, while also
yielding highly interpretable concept representations. These findings highlight
that human-in-the-loop supervision can effectively augment the complex
cognitive abilities of large models, offering a promising pathway toward
developing more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial systems.

Method: 引入时间一致性判别器，指导采样推理过程，无需扩展或微调预训练的图像扩散模型。

Result: 在理想湍流模拟和全球降水数据集上，性能与从头训练的VDMs相当，时间一致性更好，不确定性校准更优，偏差更低。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现稳定的百年尺度气候模拟，适用于高时间分辨率场景。

Abstract: Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing
and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather
prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are
the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics.
However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large
computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a
time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models
to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the
sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the
image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from
scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global
precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal
consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared
to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily
time steps.

Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has recently emerged as a
core element in the 6G networks. However, traditional centralized and
synchronous optimization algorithms are unsuitable for SAGIN due to
infrastructureless and time-varying environments. This paper aims to develop a
novel Asynchronous algorithm a.k.a. Argus for tackling non-convex and
non-smooth decentralized federated bilevel learning over SAGIN. The proposed
algorithm allows networked agents (e.g. autonomous aerial vehicles) to tackle
bilevel learning problems in time-varying networks asynchronously, thereby
averting stragglers from impeding the overall training speed. We provide a
theoretical analysis of the iteration complexity, communication complexity, and
computational complexity of Argus. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated
through numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在序列决策场景中，治疗决策和结果随时间动态演变，现有方法虽能控制观察到的混杂因素，但仍受未测量混杂因素的影响。

Method: 采用分解序列工具变量框架（DSIV-CFR），利用工具变量和负控制假设，通过广义矩条件估计序列治疗效果。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在一步和多步预测中表现优异，并能识别动态系统的最优治疗策略。

Conclusion: DSIV-CFR框架有效解决了未测量混杂因素带来的偏差问题，为序列治疗效果的估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies the cumulative causal effects of sequential treatments in
the presence of unmeasured confounders. It is a critical issue in sequential
decision-making scenarios where treatment decisions and outcomes dynamically
evolve over time. Advanced causal methods apply transformer as a backbone to
model such time sequences, which shows superiority in capturing long time
dependence and periodic patterns via attention mechanism. However, even they
control the observed confounding, these estimators still suffer from unmeasured
confounders, which influence both treatment assignments and outcomes. How to
adjust the latent confounding bias in sequential treatment effect estimation
remains an open challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Decomposing Sequential
Instrumental Variable framework for CounterFactual Regression (DSIV-CFR),
relying on a common negative control assumption. Specifically, an instrumental
variable (IV) is a special negative control exposure, while the previous
outcome serves as a negative control outcome. This allows us to recover the IVs
latent in observation variables and estimate sequential treatment effects via a
generalized moment condition. We conducted experiments on 4 datasets and
achieved significant performance in one- and multi-step prediction, supported
by which we can identify optimal treatments for dynamic systems.

Result: FCA在公平性和聚类效用间取得更好平衡，实现近乎完美的公平性且数值稳定。

Conclusion: FCA为高效用公平聚类提供了理论保证和实践优势。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness in clustering aims to balance the proportions of
instances assigned to each cluster with respect to a given sensitive attribute.
While recently developed fair clustering algorithms optimize clustering
objectives under specific fairness constraints, their inherent complexity or
approximation often results in suboptimal clustering utility or numerical
instability in practice. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair
clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair K-means
clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering
via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability
distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii)
optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that
it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any
given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility
fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing
methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and
clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical
instability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）在CXM中的应用潜力巨大，但受限于数据稀缺和现有基准的不完善，难以评估其实际效用。

Method: 通过LLM驱动的管道生成合成数据集，模拟真实CXM场景，包括知识库、问题分类和对话，并通过噪声注入和验证增强真实性。

Result: CXMArena基准测试显示，即使是先进模型在文章搜索任务中仅达到68%准确率，知识库细化任务F1分数仅为0.3，表明当前模型面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: CXMArena为CXM领域的AI评估提供了更真实的基准，揭示了现有技术的局限性，并呼吁开发更复杂的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing
Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center
operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational
environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the
limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism,
failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise,
or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this
gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset
specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the
diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable
LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the
foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product
specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The
entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise
injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation.
Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks
targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent
Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with
Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's
difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only
68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1
score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges
for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over
conventional techniques.

Conclusion: DSoftKI为处理高维全导数观测数据提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a scalable Gaussian Process (GP) method that can fit and predict
full derivative observations called DSoftKI. It extends SoftKI, a method that
approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from learned interpolation
point locations, to the setting with derivatives. DSoftKI enhances SoftKI's
interpolation scheme to incorporate the directional orientation of
interpolation points relative to the data. This enables the construction of a
scalable approximate kernel, including its first and second-order derivatives,
through interpolation. We evaluate DSoftKI on a synthetic function benchmark
and high-dimensional molecular force field prediction (100-1000 dimensions),
demonstrating that DSoftKI is accurate and can scale to larger datasets with
full derivative observations than previously possible.

Conclusion: WiMAE和ContraWiMAE为无线信道表示学习提供了高效基线，未来研究潜力大。

Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel
representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing,
without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless
communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless
Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model
pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset.
Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by
incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction
task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE
weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive
component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative
features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can

effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with
ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and
adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against
a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior
performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as
powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel
representation learning.

Conclusion: 商复形表示与QCformer为钙钛矿材料的预测建模提供了强大工具。

Abstract: The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the
challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid
organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their
exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric
deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong
potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design.
However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and
higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes
(QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material
property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex,
which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying
dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our
model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them
using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark
datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP
datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in
HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex
representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for
predictive modeling of perovskite materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决德黑兰城市绿地开发优先级问题，结合社会经济、环境与敏感性指标，优化城市绿色空间规划。

Method: 使用WRF模型估算气温，结合多种机器学习模型（如XGBoost、RF等）进行植被覆盖分类，并通过特征重要性分析确定关键指标。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市绿地开发提供了科学工具，有助于优化规划决策。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for prioritizing urban green space
development in Tehran using diverse socio-economic, environmental, and
sensitivity indices. The indices were derived from various sources including
Google Earth Engine, air pollution measurements, municipal reports and the
Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model was used to estimate
the air temperature at a 1 km resolution due to insufficient meteorological
stations, yielding RMSE and MAE values of 0.96{\deg}C and 0.92{\deg}C,
respectively. After data preparation, several machine learning models were used
for binary vegetation cover classification including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random
Forest (RF) and Extra Trees. RF achieved the highest performance, exceeding 94%
in Overall Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score. Then, the probability of areas
lacking vegetation cover was assessed using socio-economic, environmental and
sensitivity indices. This resulted in the RF generating an urban green space
development prioritization map. Feature Importance Analysis revealed that the
most significant indices were nightly land surface temperature (LST) and
sensitive population. Finally, the framework performance was validated through
microclimate simulation to assess the critical areas after and before the green
space development by green roofs. The simulation demonstrated reducing air
temperature by up to 0.67{\deg}C after utilizing the green roof technology in
critical areas. As a result, this framework provides a valuable tool for urban
planners to develop green spaces.

Motivation: 随着对大型人工智能模型（LAIM）服务的需求增长，传统的云端推理已无法满足低延迟和隐私保护的需求，边缘设备协同推理成为资源高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过剪枝和分割预训练的LAIM模型，分析参数失真与输出失真的关系，并基于速率失真理论推导参数失真的下界。随后，联合优化剪枝比例、传输功率和计算频率，提出高效的算法解决非凸优化问题。

Conclusion: 剪枝比例和分割点在资源受限的边缘环境中对系统性能优化至关重要，提出的方案为高效LAIM协同推理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The growing demand for large artificial intelligence model (LAIM) services is
driving a paradigm shift from traditional cloud-based inference to edge-based
inference for low-latency, privacy-preserving applications. In particular,
edge-device co-inference, which partitions LAIMs between edge devices and
servers, has emerged as a promising strategy for resource-efficient LAIM
execution in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate a pruning-aware
LAIM co-inference scheme, where a pre-trained LAIM is pruned and partitioned
into on-device and on-server sub-models for deployment. For analysis, we first
prove that the LAIM output distortion is upper bounded by its parameter
distortion. Then, we derive a lower bound on parameter distortion via
rate-distortion theory, analytically capturing the relationship between pruning
ratio and co-inference performance. Next, based on the analytical results, we
formulate an LAIM co-inference distortion bound minimization problem by jointly
optimizing the pruning ratio, transmit power, and computation frequency under
system latency, energy, and available resource constraints. Moreover, we
propose an efficient algorithm to tackle the considered highly non-convex
problem. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed design. In particular, model parameter distortion is shown to provide
a reliable bound on output distortion. Also, the proposed joint pruning ratio
and resource management design achieves superior performance in balancing
trade-offs among inference performance, system latency, and energy consumption
compared with benchmark schemes, such as fully on-device and on-server
inference. Moreover, the split point is shown to play a critical role in system
performance optimization under heterogeneous and resource-limited edge
environments.

TL;DR: Birch SGD是一个新的统一框架，用于分析和设计分布式SGD方法，通过计算树的几何结构简化收敛分析，并设计了八种新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一个统一的框架来理解和设计高效的异步和并行优化方法。

Method: 将每种方法表示为加权有向树（计算树），并利用其几何结构进行收敛分析。

Result: 设计了八种新方法，其中至少六种具有最优计算时间复杂度，揭示了所有方法的共同迭代率和不同方法的权衡。

Conclusion: Birch SGD为理解和设计高效的分布式优化方法提供了统一的基础。

Abstract: We propose a new unifying framework, Birch SGD, for analyzing and designing
distributed SGD methods. The central idea is to represent each method as a
weighted directed tree, referred to as a computation tree. Leveraging this
representation, we introduce a general theoretical result that reduces
convergence analysis to studying the geometry of these trees. This perspective
yields a purely graph-based interpretation of optimization dynamics, offering a
new and intuitive foundation for method development. Using Birch SGD, we design
eight new methods and analyze them alongside previously known ones, with at
least six of the new methods shown to have optimal computational time
complexity. Our research leads to two key insights: (i) all methods share the
same "iteration rate" of $O\left(\frac{(R + 1) L \Delta}{\varepsilon} +
\frac{\sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$, where $R$ the maximum "tree
distance" along the main branch of a tree; and (ii) different methods exhibit
different trade-offs-for example, some update iterates more frequently,
improving practical performance, while others are more communication-efficient
or focus on other aspects. Birch SGD serves as a unifying framework for
navigating these trade-offs. We believe these results provide a unified
foundation for understanding, analyzing, and designing efficient asynchronous
and parallel optimization methods.

this work offer a clear path for practical deployment and future extension of
my proposed method.

Abstract: Modeling and reconstructing multidimensional physical dynamics from sparse
and off-grid observations presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
research. Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising
potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically
operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle
with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical
dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in
Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution
of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the
functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal
approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and
Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with
temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn
from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors.
  At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior
Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence
guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three
physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year
scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and
molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant
improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Digital textbooks are widely used in various educational contexts, such as
university courses and online lectures. Such textbooks yield learning log data
that have been used in numerous educational data mining (EDM) studies for
student behavior analysis and performance prediction. However, these studies
have faced challenges in integrating confidential data, such as academic
records and learning logs, across schools due to privacy concerns.
Consequently, analyses are often conducted with data limited to a single
school, which makes developing high-performing and generalizable models
difficult. This study proposes a method that combines federated learning and
differential features to address these issues. Federated learning enables model
training without centralizing data, thereby preserving student privacy.
Differential features, which utilize relative values instead of absolute
values, enhance model performance and generalizability. To evaluate the
proposed method, a model for predicting at-risk students was trained using data
from 1,136 students across 12 courses conducted over 4 years, and validated on
hold-out test data from 5 other courses. Experimental results demonstrated that
the proposed method addresses privacy concerns while achieving performance
comparable to that of models trained via centralized learning in terms of Top-n
precision, nDCG, and PR-AUC. Furthermore, using differential features improved
prediction performance across all evaluation datasets compared to
non-differential approaches. The trained models were also applicable for early
prediction, achieving high performance in detecting at-risk students in earlier
stages of the semester within the validation datasets.

Abstract: Decision trees and forests have achieved successes in various real
applications, most working with all testing classes known in training data. In
this work, we focus on learning with augmented class via forests, where an
augmented class may appear in testing data yet not in training data. We
incorporate information of augmented class into trees' splitting, i.e., a new
splitting criterion, called augmented Gini impurity, is introduced to exploit
some unlabeled data from testing distribution. We then develop the approach
named Learning with Augmented Class via Forests (LACForest), which constructs
shallow forests based on the augmented Gini impurity and then splits forests
with pseudo-labeled augmented instances for better performance. We also develop
deep neural forests with a novel optimization objective based on our augmented
Gini impurity, so as to utilize the representation power of neural networks for
forests. Theoretically, we present the convergence analysis for augmented Gini
impurity, and finally conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our
approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/nju-xuf/LACForest/.

Motivation: 研究多任务模型与单任务模型的训练性能差异，以及目标变量预处理对训练效果的影响，为深度神经网络设计和数据预处理提供理论支持。

Method: 采用无约束特征模型（UFM）进行理论分析，并通过实证验证理论预测。

Result: 多任务模型在相同或更强正则化条件下训练误差更小；目标变量白化和归一化在平均方差小于1时能降低训练误差。

Conclusion: UFM为深度神经网络设计和数据预处理提供了有效的理论框架。

Abstract: The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) is a mathematical framework that
enables closed-form approximations for minimal training loss and related
performance measures in deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper leverages the
UFM to provide qualitative insights into neural multivariate regression, a
critical task in imitation learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we address two key questions: (1) How do multi-task models
compare to multiple single-task models in terms of training performance? (2)
Can whitening and normalizing regression targets improve training performance?
The UFM theory predicts that multi-task models achieve strictly smaller
training MSE than multiple single-task models when the same or stronger
regularization is applied to the latter, and our empirical results confirm
these findings. Regarding whitening and normalizing regression targets, the UFM
theory predicts that they reduce training MSE when the average variance across
the target dimensions is less than one, and our empirical results once again
confirm these findings. These findings highlight the UFM as a powerful
framework for deriving actionable insights into DNN design and data
pre-processing strategies.

Motivation: 在对抗环境中，无人机自组网的链路预测仅能依赖历史拓扑信息，而现有方法因忽略稀疏性和多尺度结构特征，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 结合图注意力网络（GATs）捕捉多尺度结构特征，使用LSTM学习时间动态性，并引入复杂损失函数优化模型。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集上验证，MUST实现了最先进的链路预测性能。

Conclusion: MUST模型在高度动态和稀疏的UANETs中表现出色，为链路预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Link prediction in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks (UANETs)
aims to predict the potential formation of future links between UAVs. In
adversarial environments where the route information of UAVs is unavailable,
predicting future links must rely solely on the observed historical topological
information of UANETs. However, the highly dynamic and sparse nature of UANET
topologies presents substantial challenges in effectively capturing meaningful
structural and temporal patterns for accurate link prediction. Most existing
link prediction methods focus on temporal dynamics at a single structural scale
while neglecting the effects of sparsity, resulting in insufficient information
capture and limited applicability to UANETs. In this paper, we propose a
multi-scale structural-temporal link prediction model (MUST) for UANETs.
Specifically, we first employ graph attention networks (GATs) to capture
structural features at multiple levels, including the individual UAV level, the
UAV community level, and the overall network level. Then, we use long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the temporal dynamics of these
multi-scale structural features. Additionally, we address the impact of
sparsity by introducing a sophisticated loss function during model
optimization. We validate the performance of MUST using several UANET datasets
generated through simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
MUST achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance in highly dynamic
and sparse UANETs.

Conclusion: GreenFactory在多种数据集和搜索空间中表现稳健，为神经架构搜索提供高效准确的性能预测工具。

Abstract: Determining the performance of a Deep Neural Network during Neural
Architecture Search processes is essential for identifying optimal
architectures and hyperparameters. Traditionally, this process requires
training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training,
serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies
often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative
rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we
propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random
forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict
model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust
results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high
Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement
between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945
for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we
achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for
ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.

Conclusion: CleanSE通过利用干净样本的监督信息，有效减少了假阳性标签的影响，提升了部分标签学习的性能。

Abstract: Diminishing the impact of false-positive labels is critical for conducting
disambiguation in partial label learning. However, the existing disambiguation
strategies mainly focus on exploiting the characteristics of individual partial
label instances while neglecting the strong supervision information of clean
samples randomly lying in the datasets. In this work, we show that clean
samples can be collected to offer guidance and enhance the confidence of the
most possible candidates. Motivated by the manner of the differentiable count
loss strat- egy and the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, we proposed a new
calibration strategy called CleanSE. Specifically, we attribute the most
reliable candidates with higher significance under the assumption that for each
clean sample, if its label is one of the candidates of its nearest neighbor in
the representation space, it is more likely to be the ground truth of its
neighbor. Moreover, clean samples offer help in characterizing the sample
distributions by restricting the label counts of each label to a specific
interval. Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic benchmarks and 5 real-world PLL
datasets showed this calibration strategy can be applied to most of the
state-of-the-art PLL methods as well as enhance their performance.

Result: MixQ-GNN在节点和图分类任务中分别减少5.5倍和5.1倍的位操作。

Conclusion: MixQ-GNN高效且兼容现有方法，显著提升GNN推理效率。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for handling large-scale
graph applications. However, the computational demands of GNNs necessitate the
development of efficient methods to accelerate inference. Mixed precision
quantization emerges as a promising solution to enhance the efficiency of GNN
architectures without compromising prediction performance. Compared to
conventional deep learning architectures, GNN layers contain a wider set of
components that can be quantized, including message passing functions,
aggregation functions, update functions, the inputs, learnable parameters, and
outputs of these functions. In this paper, we introduce a theorem for efficient
quantized message passing to aggregate integer messages. It guarantees
numerical equality of the aggregated messages using integer values with respect
to those obtained with full (FP32) precision. Based on this theorem, we
introduce the Mixed Precision Quantization for GNN (MixQ-GNN) framework, which
flexibly selects effective integer bit-widths for all components within GNN
layers. Our approach systematically navigates the wide set of possible
bit-width combinations, addressing the challenge of optimizing efficiency while
aiming at maintaining comparable prediction performance. MixQ-GNN integrates
with existing GNN quantization methods, utilizing their graph structure
advantages to achieve higher prediction performance. On average, MixQ-GNN
achieved reductions in bit operations of 5.5x for node classification and 5.1x
for graph classification compared to architectures represented in FP32
precision.

Method: 使用IMU数据训练MLP、KAN、CNN和FKAN模型，比较可学习激活函数的效果，并评估用户特定数据与池化数据的性能差异。

Result: 可学习激活函数未显著提升性能；用户特定数据在ML模型中表现更优，而DL模型中两者无显著差异。

Conclusion: 可学习激活函数可能在更复杂任务中表现更好；池化数据在DL模型中可行，为假肢控制提供数据共享的可能性。

Abstract: Objective: This paper investigates the potential of learnable activation
functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for personalized control in a
lower-limb prosthesis. In addition, user-specific vs. pooled training data is
evaluated to improve machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) performance
for turn intent prediction.
  Method: Inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the shank were collected
from five individuals with lower-limb amputation performing turning tasks in a
laboratory setting. Ability to classify an upcoming turn was evaluated for
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), convolutional
neural network (CNN), and fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FKAN). The
comparison of MLP and KAN (for ML models) and FKAN and CNN (for DL models)
assessed the effectiveness of learnable activation functions. Models were
trained separately on user-specific and pooled data to evaluate the impact of
training data on their performance.
  Results: Learnable activation functions in KAN and FKAN did not yield
significant improvement compared to MLP and CNN, respectively. Training on
user-specific data yielded superior results compared to pooled data for ML
models ($p < 0.05$). In contrast, no significant difference was observed
between user-specific and pooled training for DL models.
  Significance: These findings suggest that learnable activation functions may
demonstrate distinct advantages in datasets involving more complex tasks and
larger volumes. In addition, pooled training showed comparable performance to
user-specific training in DL models, indicating that model training for

*Achref Doula,Max Mühläuser,Alejandro Sanchez Guinea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafePath是一个模块化框架，通过整合LLM和共形预测，为自动驾驶路径规划提供形式化安全保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自动驾驶路径规划中表现出潜力，但其过度自信和幻觉行为引发安全隐患，需要一种方法确保安全性。

Method: SafePath分三阶段运行：生成多样化候选路径，通过共形预测过滤高风险路径，最终选择低风险路径或移交人类控制。

Result: 实验表明，SafePath减少77%的规划不确定性和高达70%的碰撞率。

Conclusion: SafePath通过形式化保障和可调节的自主性，显著提升了LLM驱动的路径规划安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by
reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their
tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety
concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based
path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction.
SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that
generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories
based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath
filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe
option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice
question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the
final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision
risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty
is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with
a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be
tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and
Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and
collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven
path planning more safer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种克服凸平滑替代损失与线性遗憾界限之间权衡的方法，通过构造基于Fenchel-Young损失的替代损失，实现了优化和统计效率的双赢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决凸平滑替代损失在优化和估计上的优势与线性遗憾界限之间的潜在矛盾。

Method: 方法基于Fenchel-Young损失和卷积负熵，通过构造一个预测链接，保持替代遗憾界限的线性。

Result: 结果表明，该方法在保持平滑性的同时实现了线性遗憾界限，并提供了类别概率的一致估计。

Conclusion: 结论展示了凸分析在风险最小化中的优化和统计效率方面的应用潜力。

Abstract: Surrogate regret bounds bridge the gap between the convergence rates of
surrogate and target losses, with linear bounds favorable for their lossless
regret transfer. While convex smooth surrogate losses are appealing in
particular due to the efficient estimation and optimization, the existence of a
trade-off between the smoothness and linear regret bound has been believed in
the community. That being said, the better optimization and estimation
properties of convex smooth surrogate losses may inevitably deteriorate after
undergoing the regret transfer onto a target loss. We overcome this dilemma for
arbitrary discrete target losses by constructing a convex smooth surrogate
loss, which entails a linear surrogate regret bound composed with a tailored
prediction link. The construction is based on Fenchel-Young losses generated by
the convolutional negentropy, which are equivalent to the infimal convolution
of a generalized negentropy and the target Bayes risk. Consequently, the
infimal convolution enables us to derive a smooth loss while maintaining the
surrogate regret bound linear. We additionally benefit from the infimal
convolution to have a consistent estimator of the underlying class probability.
Our results are overall a novel demonstration of how convex analysis penetrates
into optimization and statistical efficiency in risk minimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合确定性秩降自编码器（RRAEs）和变分自编码器（VAEs）优势的模型——变分秩降自编码器（VRRAEs），通过KL散度正则化和潜在空间采样，在生成任务中表现优于RRAEs和VAEs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合RRAEs的确定性正则化和VAEs的生成能力，提升生成模型的性能并减少后验崩溃的可能性。

Method: 使用截断SVD对潜在空间进行正则化，结合KL散度正则化和潜在空间采样，构建VRRAEs模型。

Result: VRRAEs在合成数据集和真实数据集（MNIST、CelebA、CIFAR-10）上均优于RRAEs和VAEs，生成任务中FID得分更高。

Conclusion: VRRAEs通过结合RRAEs和VAEs的优势，显著提升了生成模型的性能，并有效减少了后验崩溃的风险。

Abstract: Deterministic Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) enforce by construction a
regularization on the latent space by applying a truncated SVD. While this
regularization makes Autoencoders more powerful, using them for generative
purposes is counter-intuitive due to their deterministic nature. On the other
hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well known for their generative
abilities by learning a probabilistic latent space. In this paper, we present
Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs), a model that leverages the
advantages of both RRAEs and VAEs. Our claims and results show that when
carefully sampling the latent space of RRAEs and further regularizing with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (similarly to VAEs), VRRAEs outperform RRAEs
and VAEs. Additionally, we show that the regularization induced by the SVD not
only makes VRRAEs better generators than VAEs, but also reduces the possibility
of posterior collapse. Our results include a synthetic dataset of a small size
that showcases the robustness of VRRAEs against collapse, and three real-world
datasets; the MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10, over which VRRAEs are shown to
outperform both VAEs and RRAEs on many random generation and interpolation
tasks based on the FID score.

TL;DR: AdaLin通过动态调整神经元激活函数，有效缓解深度神经网络中的塑性损失问题，提升持续学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在非稳态问题中易失去塑性，影响增量学习能力。AdaLin旨在通过自适应线性化解决这一问题。

Method: AdaLin为每个神经元引入可学习参数和门控机制，动态调整激活函数的线性化程度，无需额外超参数或任务边界。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如MNIST、CIFAR）和复杂场景（如增量学习、强化学习）中，AdaLin显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: AdaLin通过神经元级自适应有效缓解塑性损失，为持续学习提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a
model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key
obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown
that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity.
Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a
general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to
mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or
periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a
gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on
its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal
and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters
or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation
functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can
significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random
Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split
CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such
as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in
mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We
perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is
crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network
that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.

TL;DR: 论文研究了后训练方法（如微调、对齐和遗忘）如何改变语言模型的行为和表示，并探讨其脆弱性。提出了一种分层遗忘（LU）算法以提高对抗性重新学习的鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 探索后训练方法修改语言模型的机制及其脆弱性，尤其是如何通过提示工程或重新学习绕过这些修改。

Method: 设计了分层遗忘（LU）算法，通过分阶段抑制数据子集来限制重新学习的能力。

Result: 实验表明，LU提高了多种遗忘方法对对抗性重新学习的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LU为机器遗忘领域提供了新方法，并揭示了后训练更新的影响。

Abstract: Our goal is to understand how post-training methods, such as fine-tuning,
alignment, and unlearning, modify language model behavior and representations.
We are particularly interested in the brittle nature of these modifications
that makes them easy to bypass through prompt engineering or relearning. Recent
results suggest that post-training induces shallow context-dependent
``circuits'' that suppress specific response patterns. This could be one
explanation for the brittleness of post-training. To test this hypothesis, we
design an unlearning algorithm, Layered Unlearning (LU), that creates distinct
inhibitory mechanisms for a growing subset of the data. By unlearning the first
$i$ folds while retaining the remaining $k - i$ at the $i$th of $k$ stages, LU
limits the ability of relearning on a subset of data to recover the full
dataset. We evaluate LU through a combination of synthetic and large language
model (LLM) experiments. We find that LU improves robustness to adversarial
relearning for several different unlearning methods. Our results contribute to
the state-of-the-art of machine unlearning and provide insight into the effect
of post-training updates.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型的偏见已有较多研究，但表格ICL中的偏见表现尚不明确，因此论文旨在探讨其公平性影响。

Method: 论文提出了三种预处理策略：相关性去除、组平衡演示选择和基于不确定性的演示选择，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于不确定性的演示选择能显著提升上下文预测的组公平性。

Conclusion: 表格ICL的公平性可以通过预处理策略改善，尤其是基于不确定性的演示选择方法效果最佳。

Abstract: Tabular foundational models have exhibited strong in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities on structured data, allowing them to make accurate predictions on
test sets without parameter updates, using training examples as context. This
emerging approach positions itself as a competitive alternative to traditional
gradient-boosted tree methods. However, while biases in conventional machine
learning models are well documented, it remains unclear how these biases
manifest in tabular ICL. The paper investigates the fairness implications of
tabular ICL and explores three preprocessing strategies--correlation removal,
group-balanced demonstration selection, and uncertainty-based demonstration
selection--to address bias. Comprehensive experiments indicate that
uncertainty-based demonstration selection consistently enhances group fairness
of in-context predictions. The source code for reproducing the results of this
work can be found at https://github.com/patrikken/Fair-TabICL.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络梯度流在常见可微激活函数下的行为，理解其收敛或发散的条件。

Method: 利用o-minimal结构的几何性质，结合理论证明和数值实验验证。

Result: 梯度流在足够好的初始化下会发散到无穷大，损失趋于渐近临界值；多项式目标函数下最优损失为零。

Conclusion: 梯度流的行为取决于初始化和目标函数，理论结果在现实场景中也有类似表现。

Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feed forward
neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation
functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function.
We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or
diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value.
Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon>0$ such that the
loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the
optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently
big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and
can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main
result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to
infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We
confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our
investigation to real-world scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络的消息传递框架依赖图的连通性结构，难以捕捉几何图中的丰富几何特征。

Method: 提出Rhomboid Tiling (RT)聚类方法，利用数据的复杂几何信息进行聚类；设计RTPool模型用于图分类。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上，RTPool模型性能优于21种现有方法。

Conclusion: RT聚类和RTPool模型能有效提取高阶几何结构，提升图分类性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective for learning from
graph-structured data through their neighborhood-based message passing
framework. Many hierarchical graph clustering pooling methods modify this
framework by introducing clustering-based strategies, enabling the construction
of more expressive and powerful models. However, all of these message passing
framework heavily rely on the connectivity structure of graphs, limiting their
ability to capture the rich geometric features inherent in geometric graphs. To
address this, we propose Rhomboid Tiling (RT) clustering, a novel clustering
method based on the rhomboid tiling structure, which performs clustering by
leveraging the complex geometric information of the data and effectively
extracts its higher-order geometric structures. Moreover, we design RTPool, a
hierarchical graph clustering pooling model based on RT clustering for graph
classification tasks. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance,
outperforming 21 state-of-the-art competitors on all the 7 benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有离线异常检测方法在流数据场景下不实用，而在线方法通常依赖周期性重训练，未能完全解决流数据的动态性挑战。

Method: 提出Online-iForest，一种专为流数据设计的方法，能够实时跟踪数据生成过程的动态变化。

Result: 实验验证表明，Online-iForest性能与在线方法相当，接近离线方法，且在效率上显著优于所有竞争对手。

Conclusion: Online-iForest在需要快速识别异常的应用（如网络安全、欺诈检测）中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自主系统和公共环境中广泛应用，但其易受越狱漏洞攻击，现有防御方法存在局限性，如依赖模型内部架构或易被绕过。

Method: ASF作为一种输入预处理和净化器，检测并过滤对抗性后缀，有效中和恶意注入。

Result: ASF在黑白盒攻击场景下均表现出色，将攻击效果降至4%以下，同时几乎不影响模型在非对抗场景的性能。

Conclusion: ASF为LLMs提供了一种高效、通用的防御方案，显著提升了模型的安全性和可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous systems
and public-facing environments, yet they remain susceptible to jailbreak
vulnerabilities that may undermine their security and trustworthiness.
Adversarial suffixes are considered to be the current state-of-the-art
jailbreak, consistently outperforming simpler methods and frequently succeeding
even in black-box settings. Existing defenses rely on access to the internal
architecture of models limiting diverse deployment, increase memory and
computation footprints dramatically, or can be bypassed with simple prompt
engineering methods. We introduce $\textbf{Adversarial Suffix Filtering}$
(ASF), a lightweight novel model-agnostic defensive pipeline designed to
protect LLMs against adversarial suffix attacks. ASF functions as an input
preprocessor and sanitizer that detects and filters adversarially crafted
suffixes in prompts, effectively neutralizing malicious injections. We
demonstrate that ASF provides comprehensive defense capabilities across both
black-box and white-box attack settings, reducing the attack efficacy of
state-of-the-art adversarial suffix generation methods to below 4%, while only
minimally affecting the target model's capabilities in non-adversarial
scenarios.

Result: 在STaRK基准测试中，平均首次命中率比次优方法高25.7%。

Conclusion: FocusedRetriever展示了SKB在多跳问答中的潜力，并为进一步优化（如微调）提供了机会。

Abstract: In many real-world settings, machine learning models and interactive systems
have access to both structured knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs or tables, and
unstructured content, e.g., natural language documents. However, most rely on
either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking
unstructured content to nodes within structured data, thereby enabling new
strategies for knowledge access and use. In this work, we present
FocusedRetriever, a modular SKB-based framework for multi-hop question
answering. It integrates components (VSS-based entity search, LLM-based
generation of Cypher queries and pairwise re-ranking) in a way that enables it
to outperform state-of-the-art methods across all three STaRK benchmark test
sets, covering diverse domains and multiple performance metrics. The average
first-hit rate exceeds that of the second-best method by 25.7%.
FocusedRetriever leverages (1) the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
extract relational facts and entity attributes from unstructured text, (2) node
set joins to filter answer candidates based on these extracted triplets and
constraints, (3) vector similarity search to retrieve and rank relevant
unstructured content, and (4) the contextual capabilities of LLMs to finally
rank the top-k answers. For generality, we only incorporate base LLMs in
FocusedRetriever in our evaluation. However, our analysis of intermediate
results highlights several opportunities for further upgrades including
finetuning. The source code is publicly available at

Abstract: Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are
reported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \emph{top-n}
recommendation. However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress
in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread
methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led
to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether
these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce
the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published
at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are
concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through
experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on
diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon
footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models.
Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of
diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task,
raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that,
in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are
constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological
issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the
research and publication culture in this area.

Method: 采用非平稳高斯过程框架，结合广义谱混合核（GSM），以捕捉风速和功率数据的时间变化模式和异方差行为。

Result: 在真实SCADA数据上测试，GSM模型在短、中、长期预测中表现优于传统径向基函数和谱混合核，尤其在短期预测中效果显著。

Conclusion: 非平稳性建模对风功率预测至关重要，非平稳高斯过程模型在实际应用中具有显著价值。

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic forecasting of wind power is essential for maintaining
grid stability and enabling efficient integration of renewable energy sources.
Gaussian Process (GP) models offer a principled framework for quantifying
uncertainty; however, conventional approaches rely on stationary kernels, which
are inadequate for modeling the inherently non-stationary nature of wind speed
and power output. We propose a non-stationary GP framework that incorporates
the generalized spectral mixture (GSM) kernel, enabling the model to capture
time-varying patterns and heteroscedastic behaviors in wind speed and wind
power data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on real-world
SCADA data across short\mbox{-,} medium-, and long-term forecasting horizons.
Compared to standard radial basis function and spectral mixture kernels, the
GSM-based model outperforms, particularly in short-term forecasts. These
results highlight the necessity of modeling non-stationarity in wind power
forecasting and demonstrate the practical value of non-stationary GP models in
operational settings.

Conclusion: 通过分类框架和标准化报告协议，本文为VLM研究提供了实用工具，促进社区采纳并提升研究质量。

Abstract: The intricate and multifaceted nature of vision language model (VLM)
development, adaptation, and application necessitates the establishment of
clear and standardized reporting protocols, particularly within the high-stakes
context of healthcare. Defining these reporting standards is inherently
challenging due to the diverse nature of studies involving VLMs, which vary
significantly from the development of all new VLMs or finetuning for domain
alignment to off-the-shelf use of VLM for targeted diagnosis and prediction
tasks. In this position paper, we argue that traditional machine learning
reporting standards and evaluation guidelines must be restructured to
accommodate multiphase VLM studies; it also has to be organized for intuitive
understanding of developers while maintaining rigorous standards for
reproducibility. To facilitate community adoption, we propose a categorization
framework for VLM studies and outline corresponding reporting standards that
comprehensively address performance evaluation, data reporting protocols, and
recommendations for manuscript composition. These guidelines are organized
according to the proposed categorization scheme. Lastly, we present a checklist
that consolidates reporting standards, offering a standardized tool to ensure
consistency and quality in the publication of VLM-related research.

Motivation: 了解人工智能和机器人技术对全球劳动力市场的重塑，以及公众对这些技术的态度演变。

Method: 使用2017、2018、2020和2023年的Latinobarómetro调查数据，对48,000多名受访者进行统计建模和潜在类别分析。

Result: 发现2018年担忧达到峰值，教育水平和政治倾向是最一致的预测因素。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了新兴经济体中AI焦虑的社会和结构维度，补充了全球北方以外对自动化态度的理解。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence and robotics increasingly reshape the global labor
market, understanding public perceptions of these technologies becomes
critical. We examine how these perceptions have evolved across Latin America,
using survey data from the 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2023 waves of the
Latinobar\'ometro. Drawing on responses from over 48,000 individuals across 16
countries, we analyze fear of job loss due to artificial intelligence and
robotics. Using statistical modeling and latent class analysis, we identify key
structural and ideological predictors of concern, with education level and
political orientation emerging as the most consistent drivers. Our findings
reveal substantial temporal and cross-country variation, with a notable peak in
fear during 2018 and distinct attitudinal profiles emerging from latent
segmentation. These results offer new insights into the social and structural
dimensions of AI anxiety in emerging economies and contribute to a broader
understanding of public attitudes toward automation beyond the Global North.

Motivation: 探讨算法停用对零工经济工人的财务稳定性影响，并解决现有政策下缺乏有效工具支持的问题。

Method: 与华盛顿州最大的网约车工会合作，设计并部署了自动化工具FareShare，用于计算停用期间的工资损失。

Result: FareShare显著减少了工资计算时间（95%以上），消除了手动错误，并提高了法律团队的工作效率。

Conclusion: FareShare在解决工资损失计算问题上有效，但也揭示了高压力劳动环境下工具采用的社会技术挑战。

Abstract: What happens when a rideshare driver is suddenly locked out of the platform
connecting them to riders, wages, and daily work? Deactivation-the abrupt
removal of gig workers' platform access-typically occurs through arbitrary AI
and algorithmic decisions with little explanation or recourse. This represents
one of the most severe forms of algorithmic control and often devastates
workers' financial stability. Recent U.S. state policies now mandate appeals
processes and recovering compensation during the period of wrongful
deactivation based on past earnings. Yet, labor organizers still lack effective
tools to support these complex, error-prone workflows. We designed FareShare, a
computational tool automating lost wage estimation for deactivated drivers,
through a 6 month partnership with the State of Washington's largest rideshare
labor union. Over the following 3 months, our field deployment of FareShare
registered 178 account signups. We observed that the tool could reduce lost
wage calculation time by over 95%, eliminate manual data entry errors, and
enable legal teams to generate arbitration-ready reports more efficiently.
Beyond these gains, the deployment also surfaced important socio-technical
challenges around trust, consent, and tool adoption in high-stakes labor
contexts.

Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，人工智能模型可能因数据不平衡和人口统计学偏差加剧现有不平等。联邦学习虽保护隐私，但仍面临算法偏见和子群不平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出FedIDA框架，结合公平性正则化和组条件过采样，支持多敏感属性和异构数据分布，不影响联邦学习的收敛性。

Result: 理论分析证明FedIDA能改善公平性，并在实验数据集中验证其提升公平性同时保持预测性能。

Conclusion: FedIDA在医疗领域实现了公平且隐私保护的建模，代码已开源。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness is critical when applying artificial intelligence to
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where predictive models trained on
imbalanced and demographically skewed data risk exacerbating existing
disparities. Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaboration
across institutions, but remains vulnerable to both algorithmic bias and
subgroup imbalance - particularly when multiple sensitive attributes intersect.
We propose FedIDA (Fed erated Learning for Imbalance and D isparity A
wareness), a framework-agnostic method that combines fairness-aware
regularization with group-conditional oversampling. FedIDA supports multiple
sensitive attributes and heterogeneous data distributions without altering the
convergence behavior of the underlying FL algorithm. We provide theoretical
analysis establishing fairness improvement bounds using Lipschitz continuity
and concentration inequalities, and show that FedIDA reduces the variance of
fairness metrics across test sets. Empirical results on both benchmark and
real-world clinical datasets confirm that FedIDA consistently improves fairness
while maintaining competitive predictive performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness for equitable and privacy-preserving modeling in healthcare. The
source code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 为AI伦理研究开辟了新方向，对教育者、研究者和生成式AI用户具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude
have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback
from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly
enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the
interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous
versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human
and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and
pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and
interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a
rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently
being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language
conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social
relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to
this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated.
Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site
of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms
of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical
investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that
considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might
reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning,
and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to
educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative
AI chatbots.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基础设施感知的基准框架，用于量化商业数据中心中30种最先进LLM推理的环境足迹，揭示了模型间巨大的能耗差异和全球规模下的资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各行业的广泛应用，了解其推理阶段的环境影响变得至关重要，但现有研究多忽略专有模型、基础设施差异或仅关注训练阶段。

Method: 结合公共API性能数据、区域环境乘数和硬件配置统计推断，采用交叉效率DEA方法评估模型性能与环境成本的相对关系。

Result: 研究发现某些模型能耗极高（如o3和DeepSeek-R1），而Claude-3.7 Sonnet在生态效率上表现最佳；全球规模的查询量导致显著的环境影响。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM部署的可持续性提供了标准化评估方法，为未来AI开发中的环境责任和可持续标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) spread across industries, understanding their
environmental footprint at the inference level is no longer optional; it is
essential. However, most existing studies exclude proprietary models, overlook
infrastructural variability and overhead, or focus solely on training, even as
inference increasingly dominates AI's environmental impact. To bridge this gap,
this paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for
quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30
state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework
combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental
multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We
additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank
models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3
and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33
Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and
that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short
GPT-4o query consumes 0.43 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results
in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use
comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual
drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a
Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox:
although individual queries are efficient, their global scale drives
disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized,
empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM
deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI
development and sustainability standards.

Motivation: 尽管Verilog在硬件设计中更受关注，但VHDL在行业中仍广泛使用，尤其是在高性能处理器设计中。然而，针对VHDL的LLM应用研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过开发特定测试集，对基础LLM进行扩展预训练（EPT），并进一步通过指令调优优化模型性能。

Conclusion: 本文展示了针对VHDL的LLM开发的潜力，并探讨了如何利用生成式AI的最新进展进一步优化硬件设计LLM。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in
recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip
designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of
LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular
languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has
received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language,
but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued
popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the
unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design,
and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we
describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically
for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance
in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance
processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and
used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a
base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model
increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we
developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This
led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an
instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator
rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of
newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude
with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs
using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.

using GPT-4o and the distilled model versions. We show in an evaluation how our
procedure improves code comments along the quality axes. We release all data

Motivation: 传统方法依赖自然语言提示，而实际软件开发中测试用例更常见，因此需要评估模型直接从测试用例生成代码的能力。

Method: 通过1000个多样化挑战和20个应用领域的测试用例，评估模型在上下文长度和多特征复杂性约束下的代码生成能力。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了测试驱动开发专用基准的实用价值，为提升大语言模型在严格应用驱动编码场景中的能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce WebApp1K, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) in test-driven development (TDD) tasks, where test cases serve as both
prompt and verification for code generation. Unlike traditional approaches
relying on natural language prompts, our benchmark emphasizes the ability of
LLMs to interpret and implement functionality directly from test cases,
reflecting real-world software development practices. Comprising 1000 diverse
challenges across 20 application domains, the benchmark evaluates LLMs on their
ability to generate compact, functional code under the constraints of context
length and multi-feature complexity. Our findings highlight instruction
following and in-context learning as critical capabilities for TDD success,
surpassing the importance of general coding proficiency or pretraining
knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluation of 19 frontier models, we reveal
performance bottlenecks, such as instruction loss in long prompts, and provide
a detailed error analysis spanning multiple root causes. This work underscores
the practical value of TDD-specific benchmarks and lays the foundation for
advancing LLM capabilities in rigorous, application-driven coding scenarios.

Result: 实验证明VPT在多样性和准确性上优于现有方法，且具有跨模型的适应性。

Conclusion: VPT是一种参数高效的方法，无需昂贵的模型重新训练，能够生成多样化且准确的代码摘要供用户选择。

Abstract: Recent advancements in source code summarization have leveraged
transformer-based pre-trained models, including Large Language Models of Code
(LLMCs), to automate and improve the generation of code summaries. However,
existing methods often focus on generating a single high-quality summary for a
given source code, neglecting scenarios where the generated summary might be
inadequate and alternative options are needed. In this paper, we introduce
Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained
models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing
the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code. Our method
integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework as a modular
component into pre-trained models, enabling us to model the distribution of
observed target summaries and sample continuous embeddings to be used as
prefixes to steer the generation of diverse outputs during decoding.
Importantly, we construct our method in a parameter-efficient manner,
eliminating the need for expensive model retraining, especially when using
LLMCs. Furthermore, we employ a bi-criteria reranking method to select a subset
of generated summaries, optimizing both the diversity and the accuracy of the
options presented to users. We present extensive experimental evaluations using
widely used datasets and current state-of-the-art pre-trained code
summarization models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its
adaptability across models.

Method: 提出DPN-GAN，结合周期性ReLU激活函数和可变形卷积操作，支持多分辨率生成，并优化判别器网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，DPN-GAN在性能和鲁棒性上优于现有GAN模型。

Conclusion: DPN-GAN通过创新的周期性激活和可变形卷积，显著提升了音频生成的质量和适应性。

Abstract: In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant
progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on
bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated
audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To
address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN),
a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU
activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This
innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce
intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN
module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution
operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and
fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator
network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and
generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions
of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M
parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both
speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of
the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers
superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its
robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN
outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics,
and exhibits increased robustness in synthesized audio.

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，适用于资源受限设备，显著提升了KWS系统在噪声环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key component of smart devices, enabling
efficient and intuitive audio interaction. However, standard KWS systems
deployed on embedded devices often suffer performance degradation under
real-world operating conditions. Resilient KWS systems address this issue by
enabling dynamic adaptation, with applications such as adding or replacing
keywords, adjusting to specific users, and improving noise robustness. However,
deploying resilient, standalone KWS systems with low latency on
resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory and
computational resources. This study proposes a low computational approach for
continuous noise adaptation of pretrained neural networks used for KWS
classification, requiring only 1-shot learning and one epoch. The proposed
method was assessed using two pretrained models and three real-world noise
sources at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 24 to -3 dB. The adapted
models consistently outperformed the pretrained models across all scenarios,
especially at SNR $\leq$ 18 dB, achieving accuracy improvements of 4.9% to
46.0%. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed methodology while
being lightweight enough for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Photonic chip design has seen significant advancements with the adoption of
inverse design methodologies, offering flexibility and efficiency in optimizing
device performance. However, the black-box nature of the optimization
approaches, such as those used in inverse design in order to minimize a loss
function or maximize coupling efficiency, poses challenges in understanding the
outputs. This challenge is prevalent in machine learning-based optimization
methods, which can suffer from the same lack of transparency. To this end,
interpretability techniques address the opacity of optimization models. In this
work, we apply interpretability techniques from machine learning, with the aim
of gaining understanding of inverse design optimization used in designing
photonic components, specifically two-mode multiplexers. We base our
methodology on the widespread interpretability technique known as local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or LIME. As a result, LIME-informed
insights point us to more effective initial conditions, directly improving
device performance. This demonstrates that interpretability methods can do more
than explain models -- they can actively guide and enhance the inverse-designed
photonic components. Our results demonstrate the ability of interpretable
techniques to reveal underlying patterns in the inverse design process, leading
to the development of better-performing components.

weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and
human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is
essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed
to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection
remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first
framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind
data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification
without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the
strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine
learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model,
previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline,
particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance
on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW)
data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance
degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection
pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5%
of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more
data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results
mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay
the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.

### [104] [Bounding Neyman-Pearson Region with $f$-Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08899)
*Andrew Mullhaupt,Cheng Peng*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的下界方法，用于描述Neyman-Pearson区域的边界，并通过$f$-散度改进现有结果。同时，给出了Chernoff系数的上界，并提供了构造分布对的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Neyman-Pearson区域的边界特性，改进现有边界估计方法，并探索其实际应用。

Method: 利用$f$-散度建立下界，分析KL散度改进Pinsker不等式，并通过Chernoff系数给出上界。提供构造分布对的方法。

Result: 证明了$f$-散度下界的最优性，改进了Pinsker不等式，并给出了Chernoff系数的上界。

Conclusion: 论文为Neyman-Pearson边界提供了新的理论工具和构造方法，具有理论和实际意义。

Abstract: The Neyman-Pearson region of a simple binary hypothesis testing is the set of
points whose coordinates represent the false positive rate and false negative
rate of some test. The lower boundary of this region is given by the
Neyman-Pearson lemma, and is up to a coordinate change, equivalent to the
optimal ROC curve. We establish a novel lower bound for the boundary in terms
of any $f$-divergence. Since the bound generated by hockey-stick
$f$-divergences characterizes the Neyman-Pearson boundary, this bound is best
possible. In the case of KL divergence, this bound improves Pinsker's
inequality. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form refined upper bound for the
Neyman-Pearson boundary in terms of the Chernoff $\alpha$-coefficient. Finally,
we present methods for constructing pairs of distributions that can
approximately or exactly realize any given Neyman-Pearson boundary.

### [105] [Statistical Decision Theory with Counterfactual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08908)
*Benedikt Koch,Kosuke Imai*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 论文扩展了经典统计决策理论，通过引入反事实损失来评估决策质量，解决了仅依赖观察结果的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典决策理论仅基于观察结果评估决策，无法考虑反事实结果，限制了决策质量的全面评估。

Method: 在强可忽略性假设下，论文证明了反事实风险的可识别性，并提出加性反事实损失函数。

Result: 反事实风险在加性损失函数下可识别，且在多治疗选择中可能产生与传统方法不同的推荐。

Conclusion: 论文通过引入反事实损失，为决策理论提供了更全面的评估框架，尤其在多治疗选择中具有实际意义。

Abstract: Classical statistical decision theory evaluates treatment choices based
solely on observed outcomes. However, by ignoring counterfactual outcomes, it
cannot assess the quality of decisions relative to feasible alternatives. For
example, the quality of a physician's decision may depend not only on patient
survival, but also on whether a less invasive treatment could have produced a
similar result. To address this limitation, we extend standard decision theory
to incorporate counterfactual losses--criteria that evaluate decisions using
all potential outcomes. The central challenge in this generalization is
identification: because only one potential outcome is observed for each unit,
the associated risk under a counterfactual loss is generally not identifiable.
We show that under the assumption of strong ignorability, a counterfactual risk
is identifiable if and only if the counterfactual loss function is additive in
the potential outcomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that additive counterfactual
losses can yield treatment recommendations that differ from those based on
standard loss functions, provided that the decision problem involves more than
two treatment options.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用平衡传播训练拉格朗日力学动态系统的方法，适用于周期性边界条件或固定初始/终止状态的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展平衡传播方法至动态轨迹，利用作用量极值原理，避免显式时间反向传播。

Method: 通过轻微调整轨迹至目标状态，测量参数共轭变量的响应，实现高效参数更新。

Result: 适用于周期性边界条件的系统，并可推广至耗散系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态系统训练提供了一种高效且无需显式反向传播的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian
mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium
Propagation -- initially developed for energy-based models -- to dynamical
trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is
achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring
how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This
method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or
fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without
requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic
boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum
Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also
discussed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据深度的局部中心聚类方法（DLCC），克服了传统聚类方法在多模态数据和非凸聚类中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法通常针对特定场景设计，存在局限性，尤其是在处理多模态数据和非凸聚类时。

Method: 利用局部数据深度识别局部中心，结合密度度量评估聚类性能。

Result: DLCC能够有效处理多模态数据和非凸聚类，提升聚类灵活性。

Conclusion: DLCC是一种灵活的聚类方法，扩展了传统聚类方法的应用范围。

Abstract: Cluster analysis, or clustering, plays a crucial role across numerous
scientific and engineering domains. Despite the wealth of clustering methods
proposed over the past decades, each method is typically designed for specific
scenarios and presents certain limitations in practical applications. In this
paper, we propose depth-based local center clustering (DLCC). This novel method
makes use of data depth, which is known to produce a center-outward ordering of
sample points in a multivariate space. However, data depth typically fails to
capture the multimodal characteristics of {data}, something of the utmost
importance in the context of clustering. To overcome this, DLCC makes use of a
local version of data depth that is based on subsets of {data}. From this,
local centers can be identified as well as clusters of varying shapes.
Furthermore, we propose a new internal metric based on density-based clustering
to evaluate clustering performance on {non-convex clusters}. Overall, DLCC is a
flexible clustering approach that seems to overcome some limitations of
traditional clustering methods, thereby enhancing data analysis capabilities
across a wide range of application scenarios.

### [108] [Scalable Computations for Generalized Mixed Effects Models with Crossed Random Effects Using Krylov Subspace Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09552)
*Pascal Kündig,Fabio Sigrist*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Krylov子空间的新方法，用于解决高维交叉随机效应模型中的计算瓶颈，显著提升了计算效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维交叉随机效应模型的计算依赖于Cholesky分解，但这种方法在计算上非常耗时，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了Krylov子空间方法，分析了共轭梯度法和随机Lanczos求积法的预条件器，推导了新的收敛结果，并改进了预测方差的计算方法。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在计算时间和稳定性上显著优于Cholesky分解，运行时间减少约两个数量级，软件实现比现有工具快10000倍。

Conclusion: 新方法在高效性和稳定性上具有显著优势，已通过GPBoost库实现，并提供了Python和R接口。

Abstract: Mixed effects models are widely used for modeling data with hierarchically
grouped structures and high-cardinality categorical predictor variables.
However, for high-dimensional crossed random effects, current standard
computations relying on Cholesky decompositions can become prohibitively slow.
In this work, we present novel Krylov subspace-based methods that address
several existing computational bottlenecks. Among other things, we
theoretically analyze and empirically evaluate various preconditioners for the
conjugate gradient and stochastic Lanczos quadrature methods, derive new
convergence results, and develop computationally efficient methods for
calculating predictive variances. Extensive experiments using simulated and
real-world data sets show that our proposed methods scale much better than
Cholesky-based computations, for instance, achieving a runtime reduction of
approximately two orders of magnitudes for both estimation and prediction.
Moreover, our software implementation is up to 10'000 times faster and more
stable than state-of-the-art implementations such as lme4 and glmmTMB when
using default settings. Our methods are implemented in the free C++ software
library GPBoost with high-level Python and R packages.

TL;DR: 论文比较了13种RNA语言模型（LMs）在RNA二级结构和功能分类的零样本预测中的表现，发现模型在两项任务中表现不平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNA语言模型近年来受到关注，但缺乏统一的标准比较。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将RNA LMs分为三类（多RNA类型预训练、特定用途RNA、统一RNA与DNA/蛋白质的模型），并与DNA和蛋白质LMs对比。

Result: 模型在二级结构预测和功能分类任务中表现不平衡，表现好的模型往往在另一任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要更平衡的无监督训练方法。

Abstract: Given usefulness of protein language models (LMs) in structure and functional
inference, RNA LMs have received increased attentions in the last few years.
However, these RNA models are often not compared against the same standard.
Here, we divided RNA LMs into three classes (pretrained on multiple RNA types
(especially noncoding RNAs), specific-purpose RNAs, and LMs that unify RNA with
DNA or proteins or both) and compared 13 RNA LMs along with 3 DNA and 1 protein
LMs as controls in zero-shot prediction of RNA secondary structure and
functional classification. Results shows that the models doing well on
secondary structure prediction often perform worse in function classification
or vice versa, suggesting that more balanced unsupervised training is needed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RICA的鲁棒独立成分分析方法，通过最小化距离相关性（dCor）来估计独立成分，并引入bowl变换增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICA方法对异常值不鲁棒，需要一种更稳健的方法。

Method: 使用距离相关性（dCor）作为依赖度量，并引入bowl变换处理异常值，逐步估计独立成分。

Result: RICA在模拟研究中表现优于其他方法，具有强一致性和参数收敛率。

Conclusion: RICA是一种鲁棒且有效的ICA方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful tool for decomposing a
multivariate signal or distribution into fully independent sources, not just
uncorrelated ones. Unfortunately, most approaches to ICA are not robust against
outliers. Here we propose a robust ICA method called RICA, which estimates the
components by minimizing a robust measure of dependence between multivariate
random variables. The dependence measure used is the distance correlation
(dCor). In order to make it more robust we first apply a new transformation
called the bowl transform, which is bounded, one-to-one, continuous, and maps
far outliers to points close to the origin. This preserves the crucial property
that a zero dCor implies independence. RICA estimates the independent sources
sequentially, by looking for the component that has the smallest dCor with the
remainder. RICA is strongly consistent and has the usual parametric rate of
convergence. Its robustness is investigated by a simulation study, in which it
generally outperforms its competitors. The method is illustrated on three
applications, including the well-known cocktail party problem.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs与人类专家比较的问题，强调需关注LLMs在临床环境中的安全使用，而非单纯对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究过于关注LLMs与人类专家的对比，而忽略了LLMs在临床环境中的潜在危害和安全使用策略。

Method: 提出需要开发策略，使人类与LLMs能够高效协作，而非对立。

Result: 强调LLMs与人类协作的重要性，而非单纯比较。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦于LLMs在临床环境中的安全使用和协作策略。

Abstract: Currently, a considerable research effort is devoted to comparing LLMs to a
group of human experts, where the term "expert" is often ill-defined or
variable, at best, in a state of constantly updating LLM releases. Without
proper safeguards in place, LLMs will threaten to cause harm to the established
structure of safe delivery of patient care which has been carefully developed
throughout history to keep the safety of the patient at the forefront. A key
driver of LLM innovation is founded on community research efforts which, if
continuing to operate under "humans versus LLMs" principles, will expedite this
trend. Therefore, research efforts moving forward must focus on effectively
characterizing the safe use of LLMs in clinical settings that persist across
the rapid development of novel LLM models. In this communication, we
demonstrate that rather than comparing LLMs to humans, there is a need to
develop strategies enabling efficient work of humans with LLMs in an almost
symbiotic manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI如ChatGPT在教育等领域广泛应用，但发展中国家因数字鸿沟难以访问。WaLLM通过WhatsApp这一普及平台填补这一空白。

Method: 开发WaLLM，集成每日热点问题、建议追问、趋势查询和排行榜奖励系统，并分析6个月的用户日志。

Result: 55%的查询为事实信息，健康类话题最受欢迎（28%），使用排行榜的用户互动量是其他用户的3倍。

Conclusion: 需关注文化定制、界面设计和用户对AI的信任校准，以优化发展中国家AI系统的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, such as ChatGPT, have transformed access to
information in education, knowledge-seeking, and everyday decision-making.
However, in many developing regions, access remains a challenge due to the
persistent digital divide. To help bridge this gap, we developed WaLLM - a
custom AI chatbot over WhatsApp, a widely used communication platform in
developing regions. Beyond answering queries, WaLLM offers several features to
enhance user engagement: a daily top question, suggested follow-up questions,
trending and recent queries, and a leaderboard-based reward system. Our service
has been operational for over 6 months, amassing over 14.7K queries from
approximately 100 users. In this paper, we present WaLLM's design and a
systematic analysis of logs to understand user interactions. Our results show
that 55% of user queries seek factual information. "Health and well-being" was
the most popular topic (28%), including queries about nutrition and disease,
suggesting users view WaLLM as a reliable source. Two-thirds of users' activity
occurred within 24 hours of the daily top question. Users who accessed the
"Leaderboard" interacted with WaLLM 3x as those who did not. We conclude by
discussing implications for culture-based customization, user interface design,
and appropriate calibration of users' trust in AI systems for developing
regions.

Result: 发现传统设计判断和新判断类型（责任分配和可靠性判断），显示AI增加了设计推理的复杂性。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在设计情境中引入了新的判断维度，为理解学生与AI的共创意义构建提供了概念框架。

Abstract: As generative AI tools become integrated into design workflows, students
increasingly engage with these tools not just as aids, but as collaborators.
This study analyzes reflections from 33 student teams in an HCI design course
to examine the kinds of judgments students make when using AI tools. We found
both established forms of design judgment (e.g., instrumental, appreciative,
quality) and emergent types: agency-distribution judgment and reliability
judgment. These new forms capture how students negotiate creative
responsibility with AI and assess the trustworthiness of its outputs. Our
findings suggest that generative AI introduces new layers of complexity into
design reasoning, prompting students to reflect not only on what AI produces,
but also on how and when to rely on it. By foregrounding these judgments, we
offer a conceptual lens for understanding how students engage in co-creative
sensemaking with AI in design contexts.

Motivation: 在线ACP工具缺乏临床咨询的个性化价值探索和决策后果澄清，PreCare旨在弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 通过两项形成性研究（观察ACP团队和访谈ACP网站用户）设计PreCare，并与ACP专业人士合作开发3个AI助手。

Result: PreCare在可用性测试中获得优秀评分，显著提升用户对个人价值的探索、知识获取和决策信心，92%用户偏好。

Conclusion: PreCare通过AI助手有效填补了在线ACP工具的不足，提升了用户体验和决策质量。

Abstract: Advance Care Planning (ACP) allows individuals to specify their preferred
end-of-life life-sustaining treatments before they become incapacitated by
injury or terminal illness (e.g., coma, cancer, dementia). While online ACP
offers high accessibility, it lacks key benefits of clinical consultations,
including personalized value exploration, immediate clarification of decision
consequences. To bridge this gap, we conducted two formative studies: 1)
shadowed and interviewed 3 ACP teams consisting of physicians, nurses, and
social workers (18 patients total), and 2) interviewed 14 users of ACP
websites. Building on these insights, we designed PreCare in collaboration with
6 ACP professionals. PreCare is a website with 3 AI-driven assistants designed
to guide users through exploring personal values, gaining ACP knowledge, and
supporting informed decision-making. A usability study (n=12) showed that
PreCare achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) rating of excellent. A
comparative evaluation (n=12) showed that PreCare's AI assistants significantly
improved exploration of personal values, knowledge, and decisional confidence,
and was preferred by 92% of participants.

Result: 初步实验和调查揭示了默认图像的特点及其对用户满意度的影响。

Conclusion: 本文为理解TTI中的默认图像奠定了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image generation (TTI), images are
generated from text prompts. However, TTI models are trained to always yield an
output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may
generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other
across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for
designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we
provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular
image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts
triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments
and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study
investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the
foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges

potential applications in higher education have attracted significant
attention. This study investigated how 148 students from diverse engineering
disciplines and regions across China used generative AI, focusing on its impact
on their learning experience and the opportunities and challenges it poses in
engineering education. Based on the surveyed data, we explored four key areas:
the frequency and application scenarios of AI use among engineering students,
its impact on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered
challenges in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in
engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the
participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their learning
efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half believing it also
enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite acknowledging improved
study efficiency, many felt their actual academic performance remained largely
unchanged and expressed concerns about the accuracy and domain-specific
reliability of generative AI. Our findings provide a first-hand insight into
the current benefits and challenges generative AI brings to students,
particularly Chinese engineering students, while offering several

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种基于Transformer的模型在血糖预测中的表现，发现Patch-wise方法在短期和长期预测中均表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的血糖预测可以为1型糖尿病治疗提供个性化干预措施，但目前Transformer模型在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用公开数据集DCLP3和OhioT1DM，训练了点状、块状、序列状和混合嵌入的Transformer模型，比较了不同时间跨度的预测效果。

Result: Crossformer在30分钟预测中表现最优（RMSE 15.6 mg/dL），而PatchTST在长期预测（1h、2h、4h）中表现最佳（RMSE分别为24.6、36.1、46.5 mg/dL）。

Conclusion: 基于块的Transformer模型能够捕捉多变量时间序列的季节性模式，显著提升血糖预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate blood glucose prediction can enable novel interventions for type 1
diabetes treatment, including personalized insulin and dietary adjustments.
Although recent advances in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated
the power of attention mechanisms in complex multivariate time series
prediction, their potential for blood glucose (BG) prediction remains
underexplored. We present a comparative analysis of transformer models for
multi-horizon BG prediction, examining forecasts up to 4 hours and input
history up to 1 week. The publicly available DCLP3 dataset (n=112) was split
(80%-10%-10%) for training, validation, and testing, and the OhioT1DM dataset
(n=12) served as an external test set. We trained networks with point-wise,
patch-wise, series-wise, and hybrid embeddings, using CGM, insulin, and meal
data. For short-term blood glucose prediction, Crossformer, a patch-wise
transformer architecture, achieved a superior 30-minute prediction of RMSE
(15.6 mg / dL on OhioT1DM). For longer-term predictions (1h, 2h, and 4h),
PatchTST, another path-wise transformer, prevailed with the lowest RMSE (24.6
mg/dL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 46.5 mg/dL on OhioT1DM). In general, models that used
tokenization through patches demonstrated improved accuracy with larger input
sizes, with the best results obtained with a one-week history. These findings
highlight the promise of transformer-based architectures for BG prediction by
capturing and leveraging seasonal patterns in multivariate time-series data to
improve accuracy.

Result: 评估20个常用库，覆盖88%的OpenSSF Scorecard检查，发现每库多达19个额外风险。

Conclusion: LibVulnWatch将治理原则转化为可验证指标，为AI供应链风险提供透明、可扩展的评估机制。

Abstract: Open-source AI libraries are foundational to modern AI systems but pose
significant, underexamined risks across security, licensing, maintenance,
supply chain integrity, and regulatory compliance. We present LibVulnWatch, a
graph-based agentic assessment framework that performs deep, source-grounded
evaluations of these libraries. Built on LangGraph, the system coordinates a
directed acyclic graph of specialized agents to extract, verify, and quantify
risk using evidence from trusted sources such as repositories, documentation,
and vulnerability databases. LibVulnWatch generates reproducible,
governance-aligned scores across five critical domains, publishing them to a
public leaderboard for longitudinal ecosystem monitoring. Applied to 20 widely
used libraries, including ML frameworks, LLM inference engines, and agent
orchestration tools, our system covers up to 88% of OpenSSF Scorecard checks
while uncovering up to 19 additional risks per library. These include critical
Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, absent Software Bills of Materials
(SBOMs), licensing constraints, undocumented telemetry, and widespread gaps in
regulatory documentation and auditability. By translating high-level governance
principles into practical, verifiable metrics, LibVulnWatch advances technical
AI governance with a scalable, transparent mechanism for continuous supply
chain risk assessment and informed library selection.

Abstract: With the rise of large language and vision-language models, AI agents have
evolved into autonomous, interactive systems capable of perception, reasoning,
and decision-making. As they proliferate across virtual and physical domains,
the Internet of Agents (IoA) has emerged as a key infrastructure for enabling
scalable and secure coordination among heterogeneous agents. This survey offers
a comprehensive examination of the security and privacy landscape in IoA
systems. We begin by outlining the IoA architecture and its distinct
vulnerabilities compared to traditional networks, focusing on four critical
aspects: identity authentication threats, cross-agent trust issues, embodied
security, and privacy risks. We then review existing and emerging defense
mechanisms and highlight persistent challenges. Finally, we identify open
research directions to advance the development of resilient and
privacy-preserving IoA ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MixBridge是一种新型扩散Schrödinger桥框架，支持任意输入分布，并研究多异构后门触发器的植入问题。通过Divide-and-Merge策略和权重重分配方案（WRS）解决性能冲突和隐蔽性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门方法主要针对单攻击场景和高斯噪声输入模型，无法满足复杂输入分布和多触发器需求。

Method: 提出MixBridge框架，通过Divide-and-Merge策略和WRS实现多触发器植入和隐蔽性增强。

Result: 实验证明MixBridge在多样生成任务中有效，解决了多触发器植入的性能冲突问题。

Conclusion: MixBridge为桥模型后门行为研究提供了灵活工具，并通过Divide-and-Merge和WRS提升了性能与隐蔽性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on implanting multiple heterogeneous backdoor triggers in
bridge-based diffusion models designed for complex and arbitrary input
distributions. Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack
scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we
propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge (DSB) framework to
cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases).
Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into
MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the
need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations
required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor
behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB
model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that
when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign
and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor
tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix
different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific
objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In
addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the
stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks
speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于检测高速公路VANET中DDoS攻击的框架，通过模拟和真实数据结合，XGBoost和CatBoost表现最佳，F1-score达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET在智能交通系统中至关重要，但DDoS攻击会威胁其可靠性，因此需要一种高效的检测方法。

Method: 使用NS-3和SUMO模拟生成数据集，结合真实高速公路数据，通过预处理和SMOTE平衡数据，评估了11种分类器。

Result: XGBoost和CatBoost表现最佳，F1-score均为96%。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性和可扩展性，适合实时部署以保护VANET中的紧急通信。

Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a key role in Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly in enabling real-time communication
for emergency vehicles. However, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks,
which interfere with safety-critical communication channels, can severely
impair their reliability. This study introduces a robust and scalable framework
to detect DDoS attacks in highway-based VANET environments. A synthetic dataset
was constructed using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) in conjunction with the
Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and further enriched with real-world
mobility traces from Germany's A81 highway, extracted via OpenStreetMap (OSM).
Three traffic categories were simulated: DDoS, VoIP, and TCP-based video
streaming (VideoTCP). The data preprocessing pipeline included normalization,
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature engineering, missing value imputation, and
class balancing using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
Feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Eleven classifiers were benchmarked, among them XGBoost (XGB), CatBoost (CB),
AdaBoost (AB), GradientBoosting (GB), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
XGB and CB achieved the best performance, each attaining an F1-score of 96%.
These results highlight the robustness of the proposed framework and its
potential for real-time deployment in VANETs to secure critical emergency
communications.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Federated Learning (FL)
presents a promising solution for joint training on distributed data while
preserving privacy and addressing data silo issues. However, this emerging
field, known as Federated Large Language Models (FLLM), faces significant
challenges, including communication and computation overheads, heterogeneity,
privacy and security concerns. Current research has primarily focused on the
feasibility of FLLM, but future trends are expected to emphasize enhancing
system robustness and security. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
the latest advancements in FLLM, examining challenges from four critical
perspectives: feasibility, robustness, security, and future directions. We
present an exhaustive survey of existing studies on FLLM feasibility, introduce
methods to enhance robustness in the face of resource, data, and task
heterogeneity, and analyze novel risks associated with this integration,
including privacy threats and security challenges. We also review the latest
developments in defense mechanisms and explore promising future research
directions, such as few-shot learning, machine unlearning, and IP protection.
This survey highlights the pressing need for further research to enhance system
robustness and security while addressing the unique challenges posed by the
integration of FL and LLM.

TL;DR: 论文研究了无人商店中基于AI的自动结账系统的安全漏洞，特别是对抗性补丁攻击对物体检测模型的破坏作用，并提出了新的评估指标和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人商店的AI系统存在安全漏洞，对抗性补丁攻击可能导致盗窃和库存问题，亟需研究其影响和防御方法。

Method: 研究了三种对抗性补丁攻击（隐藏、创建和修改攻击），提出新的颜色直方图相似性损失函数和边界框评估指标，并在数字和物理环境中验证攻击效果。

Result: 对抗性补丁攻击在物理环境中显著影响物体检测模型，阴影攻击在未知模型参数时仍能提高成功率。

Conclusion: 当前防御机制在实时检测中存在不足，需改进物体检测模型的鲁棒性以应对对抗性威胁。

Abstract: The advent of convenient and efficient fully unmanned stores equipped with
artificial intelligence-based automated checkout systems marks a new era in
retail. However, these systems have inherent artificial intelligence security
vulnerabilities, which are exploited via adversarial patch attacks,
particularly in physical environments. This study demonstrated that adversarial
patches can severely disrupt object detection models used in unmanned stores,
leading to issues such as theft, inventory discrepancies, and interference. We
investigated three types of adversarial patch attacks -- Hiding, Creating, and
Altering attacks -- and highlighted their effectiveness. We also introduce the
novel color histogram similarity loss function by leveraging attacker knowledge
of the color information of a target class object. Besides the traditional
confusion-matrix-based attack success rate, we introduce a new
bounding-boxes-based metric to analyze the practical impact of these attacks.
Starting with attacks on object detection models trained on snack and fruit
datasets in a digital environment, we evaluated the effectiveness of
adversarial patches in a physical testbed that mimicked a real unmanned store
with RGB cameras and realistic conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the
robustness of these attacks in black-box scenarios, demonstrating that shadow
attacks can enhance success rates of attacks even without direct access to
model parameters. Our study underscores the necessity for robust defense
strategies to protect unmanned stores from adversarial threats. Highlighting
the limitations of the current defense mechanisms in real-time detection
systems and discussing various proactive measures, we provide insights into
improving the robustness of object detection models and fortifying unmanned
retail environments against these attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在MLaaS平台中，如何通过差分隐私（DP）技术平衡模型性能、隐私和可解释性，以应对模型提取攻击（MEA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLaaS平台的安全性和隐私保护需求日益突出，尤其是可解释AI（XAI）可能被攻击者利用进行MEA。

Method: 研究了两种DP策略：一种在分类模型训练时实施，另一种在生成反事实解释（CFs）时实施。

Result: 评估了DP对模型性能、隐私和可解释性的影响。

Conclusion: DP技术可以有效缓解CFs引发的MEA，但需权衡其对模型性能和可解释性的影响。

Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained important attraction as a
means for deploying powerful predictive models, offering ease of use that
enables organizations to leverage advanced analytics without substantial
investments in specialized infrastructure or expertise. However, MLaaS
platforms must be safeguarded against security and privacy attacks, such as
model extraction (MEA) attacks. The increasing integration of explainable AI
(XAI) within MLaaS has introduced an additional privacy challenge, as attackers
can exploit model explanations particularly counterfactual explanations (CFs)
to facilitate MEA. In this paper, we investigate the trade offs among model
performance, privacy, and explainability when employing Differential Privacy
(DP), a promising technique for mitigating CF facilitated MEA. We evaluate two
distinct DP strategies: implemented during the classification model training
and at the explainer during CF generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的语言模型对齐方法，结合差分隐私（DP）与对齐技术，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型对齐需处理敏感用户数据，现有方法在隐私保护与性能间存在不足。

Method: 提出新算法（如DP-AdamW），将其应用于DPO和RLHF两种对齐技术，并分析隐私预算与模型效果。

Result: 实验表明，DP-AdamW结合DPO在中等隐私预算（ε=2-5）下对齐质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 研究为隐私保护与对齐性能的权衡提供了实用指南，算法表现优异。

Abstract: Language model alignment is crucial for ensuring that large language models
(LLMs) align with human preferences, yet it often involves sensitive user data,
raising significant privacy concerns. While prior work has integrated
differential privacy (DP) with alignment techniques, their performance remains
limited. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for privacy-preserving
alignment and rigorously analyze their effectiveness across varying privacy
budgets and models. Our framework can be deployed on two celebrated alignment
techniques, namely direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through systematic experiments on
large-scale language models, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, one of our algorithms, DP-AdamW,
combined with DPO, surpasses existing methods, improving alignment quality by
up to 15% under moderate privacy budgets ({\epsilon}=2-5). We further
investigate the interplay between privacy guarantees, alignment efficacy, and
computational demands, providing practical guidelines for optimizing these
trade-offs.

Result: 给出了检测率的闭式表达式，并通过数值实验验证了所提方案在合成数据和实际LLM水印中的性能。

Conclusion: 本文为LLM生成文本的水印设计提供了理论框架和实用方案，证明了其在检测能力和文本质量之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) are now able to produce text that is, in many
cases, seemingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. This has
fueled the development of watermarks that imprint a ``signal'' in LLM-generated
text with minimal perturbation of an LLM's output. This paper provides an
analysis of text watermarking in a one-shot setting. Through the lens of
hypothesis testing with side information, we formulate and analyze the
fundamental trade-off between watermark detection power and distortion in
generated textual quality. We argue that a key component in watermark design is
generating a coupling between the side information shared with the watermark
detector and a random partition of the LLM vocabulary. Our analysis identifies
the optimal coupling and randomization strategy under the worst-case LLM
next-token distribution that satisfies a min-entropy constraint. We provide a
closed-form expression of the resulting detection rate under the proposed
scheme and quantify the cost in a max-min sense. Finally, we provide an array
of numerical results, comparing the proposed scheme with the theoretical
optimum and existing schemes, in both synthetic data and LLM watermarking. Our

*Longtian Wang,Xiaofei Xie,Tianlin Li,Yuhan Zhi,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TokenProber是一种用于评估T2I模型中拒绝机制鲁棒性的方法，通过生成对抗性提示来绕过安全检查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型可能生成NSFW内容，现有拒绝机制存在漏洞，需评估其鲁棒性。

Method: TokenProber通过敏感性感知的差异测试，分析提示中的关键词，生成对抗性提示以绕过安全检查。

Result: 在5个安全检查器和3个T2I模型上测试，TokenProber平均绕过率提高54%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TokenProber能有效揭示拒绝机制的鲁棒性问题，为改进安全机制提供依据。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly advanced in producing
high-quality images. However, such models have the ability to generate images
containing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as pornography, violence,
political content, and discrimination. To mitigate the risk of generating NSFW
content, refusal mechanisms, i.e., safety checkers, have been developed to
check potential NSFW content. Adversarial prompting techniques have been
developed to evaluate the robustness of the refusal mechanisms. The key
challenge remains to subtly modify the prompt in a way that preserves its
sensitive nature while bypassing the refusal mechanisms. In this paper, we
introduce TokenProber, a method designed for sensitivity-aware differential
testing, aimed at evaluating the robustness of the refusal mechanisms in T2I
models by generating adversarial prompts. Our approach is based on the key
observation that adversarial prompts often succeed by exploiting discrepancies
in how T2I models and safety checkers interpret sensitive content. Thus, we
conduct a fine-grained analysis of the impact of specific words within prompts,
distinguishing between dirty words that are essential for NSFW content
generation and discrepant words that highlight the different sensitivity
assessments between T2I models and safety checkers. Through the
sensitivity-aware mutation, TokenProber generates adversarial prompts, striking
a balance between maintaining NSFW content generation and evading detection.
Our evaluation of TokenProber against 5 safety checkers on 3 popular T2I
models, using 324 NSFW prompts, demonstrates its superior effectiveness in
bypassing safety filters compared to existing methods (e.g., 54%+ increase on
average), highlighting TokenProber's ability to uncover robustness issues in
the existing refusal mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer编码器的自监督对比学习方法，用于通用化的入侵检测，显著提升了异常检测和有限标签数据下的监督学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着零日攻击的频率和严重性增加，传统基于签名的入侵检测系统（IDS）和依赖标签数据的机器学习方法面临泛化能力不足的挑战。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习框架，结合数据增强和Transformer架构，直接从原始数据包序列中学习流量表示，避免了传统手工特征提取的局限性。

Result: 在异常检测任务中，相比现有方法，AUC提升了3%（数据集内）和20%（跨数据集）；在有限标签数据下，监督学习AUC提升了1.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在通用化入侵检测中表现出色，尤其在跨数据集和有限标签数据场景下，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As the digital landscape becomes more interconnected, the frequency and
severity of zero-day attacks, have significantly increased, leading to an
urgent need for innovative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Machine
Learning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can
discern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to
traditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled
datasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic
patterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised
contrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically
tailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our
proposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy
combined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate
meaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant
on handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically
learns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing
performance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for
intrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better
performance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods.
Specifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for
intra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset
evaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised
intrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over
self-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated
on the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained
model when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong
performance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的动态安全策略管理框架，用于解决静态策略在云环境中的不足，显著提高了入侵检测率和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云环境（如AWS）的安全需求复杂且动态变化，静态策略已无法应对威胁的演化和资源的弹性变化。

Method: 采用深度强化学习算法（如深度Q网络和近端策略优化），利用云遥测数据动态调整防火墙规则和IAM策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架的入侵检测率（92%）显著高于静态策略（82%），且响应时间减少了58%。

Conclusion: 自适应强化学习方法能有效提升云安全策略管理的效果，同时保持高合规性和资源效率。

Abstract: The security of cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), is
complex and dynamic. Static security policies have become inadequate as threats
evolve and cloud resources exhibit elasticity [1]. This paper addresses the
limitations of static policies by proposing a security policy management
framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt dynamically.
Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including deep
Q Networks and proximal policy optimization, enabling the learning and
continuous adjustment of controls such as firewall rules and Identity and
Access Management (IAM) policies. The proposed RL based solution leverages
cloud telemetry data (AWS Cloud Trail logs, network traffic data, threat
intelligence feeds) to continuously refine security policies, maximizing threat
mitigation, and compliance while minimizing resource impact. Experimental
results demonstrate that our adaptive RL based framework significantly
outperforms static policies, achieving higher intrusion detection rates (92%
compared to 82% for static policies) and substantially reducing incident
detection and response times by 58%. In addition, it maintains high conformity
with security requirements and efficient resource usage. These findings
validate the effectiveness of adaptive reinforcement learning approaches in
improving cloud security policy management.

*Mostafa Jafari,Alireza Shameli-Sendi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种对抗性攻击方法（Prioritized Binary Rounding和sigma-binary攻击），用于在二进制特征空间中高效绕过机器学习恶意软件检测器，并揭示了现有防御方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习在Android恶意软件检测中表现优异，但其对抗性攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分评估，尤其是在二进制约束领域。

Method: 论文提出了Prioritized Binary Rounding技术将连续扰动转换为二进制特征空间，并设计了sigma-binary攻击方法，以最小特征修改实现攻击目标。

Result: 实验表明，sigma-binary攻击在Malscan数据集上优于现有攻击方法，攻击成功率超过90%（仅需10次特征修改），并揭示了现有防御方法的显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了sigma-binary攻击的重要性，以暴露现有防御的隐藏漏洞，并推动更健壮的恶意软件检测系统的开发。

Abstract: Machine learning is a key tool for Android malware detection, effectively
identifying malicious patterns in apps. However, ML-based detectors are
vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection.
Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation
frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their
robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary
Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature
spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second,
the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains,
designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on
the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and
exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped
with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant
brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10
feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained
defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small
budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack
success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates
strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks
by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack
significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under
unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for
precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing
defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection
systems.

*Zhihao Dou,Jiaqi Wang,Wei Sun,Zhuqing Liu,Minghong Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SafeFL是一种新型算法，旨在准确识别联邦学习中的恶意客户端，通过生成合成数据集区分恶意与良性模型，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性使其易受投毒攻击，现有方法在检测恶意客户端时存在误分类或依赖不现实假设的问题。

Method: 服务器收集一系列全局模型生成合成数据集，基于模型行为区分恶意与良性客户端。

Result: SafeFL在检测恶意客户端方面表现出更高的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: SafeFL为联邦学习中的安全问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model without sharing their raw data. However, the
decentralized nature of FL introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to
poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their local models to
disrupt the training process. While Byzantine-robust aggregation rules have
been developed to mitigate such attacks, they remain inadequate against more
advanced threats. In response, recent advancements have focused on FL detection
techniques to identify potentially malicious participants. Unfortunately, these
methods often misclassify numerous benign clients as threats or rely on
unrealistic assumptions about the server's capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm, SafeFL, specifically designed to accurately identify
malicious clients in FL. The SafeFL approach involves the server collecting a
series of global models to generate a synthetic dataset, which is then used to
distinguish between malicious and benign models based on their behavior.
Extensive testing demonstrates that SafeFL outperforms existing methods,
offering superior efficiency and accuracy in detecting malicious clients.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于子图特征提取和lightGBM的新型Sybil地址识别方法，通过提取时间、金额和网络结构特征，显著提升了识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对区块链生态系统构成重大安全威胁，尤其是在代币空投事件中，因此需要一种高效的识别方法。

Method: 构建双层交易子图，提取Sybil地址生命周期中的关键事件特征（如首次交易时间、首次获取gas等），并结合金额和网络结构特征进行综合分析。

Result: 在包含193,701个地址的数据集上，该方法在精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC上均超过0.9，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可进一步应用于更广泛的区块链安全领域，如交易操纵识别和流动性风险评估，有助于构建更安全公平的区块链生态系统。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant security threat to blockchain ecosystems,
particularly in token airdrop events. This paper proposes a novel sybil address
identification method based on subgraph feature extraction lightGBM. The method
first constructs a two-layer deep transaction subgraph for each address, then
extracts key event operation features according to the lifecycle of sybil
addresses, including the time of first transaction, first gas acquisition,
participation in airdrop activities, and last transaction. These temporal
features effectively capture the consistency of sybil address behavior
operations. Additionally, the method extracts amount and network structure
features, comprehensively describing address behavior patterns and network
topology through feature propagation and fusion. Experiments conducted on a
dataset containing 193,701 addresses (including 23,240 sybil addresses) show
that this method outperforms existing approaches in terms of precision, recall,
F1 score, and AUC, with all metrics exceeding 0.9. The methods and results of
this study can be further applied to broader blockchain security areas such as
transaction manipulation identification and token liquidity risk assessment,
contributing to the construction of a more secure and fair blockchain
ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学本体中常包含负面知识（如“缺乏部分”），但现有逻辑（如EL）无法直接表示这些概念，而完全引入否定会导致逻辑不可处理。因此，需要一种既能表达负面知识又保持可处理性的方法。

Method: 通过引入弱化的否定语义，并利用范畴语义学方法，识别并去除导致不可处理性的独立范畴性质，从而扩展EL逻辑。

Result: 提出的逻辑比带有底部概念、传递角色和角色包含的EL更具表达力，同时保持了可处理性。

Conclusion: 通过弱化语义，成功扩展了EL逻辑，使其能够表示负面知识且不牺牲可处理性。

Abstract: Biomedical ontologies contain numerous concept or role names involving
negative knowledge such as lacks_part, absence_of. Such a representation with
labels rather than logical constructors would not allow a reasoner to interpret
lacks_part as a kind of negation of has_part. It is known that adding negation
to the tractable Description Logic (DL) EL allowing for conjunction,
existential restriction and concept inclusion makes it intractable since the
obtained logic includes implicitly disjunction and universal restriction which
interact with other constructors. In this paper, we propose a new extension of
EL with a weakened negation allowing to represent negative knowledge while
retaining tractability. To this end, we introduce categorical semantics of all
logical constructors of the DL SH including EL with disjunction, negation,
universal restriction, role inclusion and transitive roles. The categorical
semantics of a logical constructor is usually described as a set of categorical
properties referring to several objects without using set membership. To
restore tractability, we have to weaken semantics of disjunction and universal
restriction by identifying \emph{independent} categorical properties that are
responsible for intractability, and dropping them from the set of categorical
properties. We show that the logic resulting from weakening semantics is more
expressive than EL with the bottom concept, transitive roles and role
inclusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的3D肺段重建对肺段切除术和肺癌手术规划至关重要，但现有方法在计算资源和分辨率上存在不足。

Method: 使用神经隐式函数学习3D表面，通过变形可学习模板实现解剖感知的精确重建，并引入两个临床相关评估指标。

Result: 提出的方法优于现有方法，并开发了名为Lung3D的公开数据集，包含800个标记的肺段3D模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为肺段重建提供了新视角，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: High-quality 3D reconstruction of pulmonary segments plays a crucial role in
segmentectomy and surgical treatment planning for lung cancer. Due to the
resolution requirement of the target reconstruction, conventional deep
learning-based methods often suffer from computational resource constraints or
limited granularity. Conversely, implicit modeling is favored due to its
computational efficiency and continuous representation at any resolution. We
propose a neural implicit function-based method to learn a 3D surface to
achieve anatomy-aware, precise pulmonary segment reconstruction, represented as
a shape by deforming a learnable template. Additionally, we introduce two
clinically relevant evaluation metrics to assess the reconstruction
comprehensively. Further, due to the absence of publicly available shape
datasets to benchmark reconstruction algorithms, we developed a shape dataset
named Lung3D, including the 3D models of 800 labeled pulmonary segments and the
corresponding airways, arteries, veins, and intersegmental veins. We
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, providing
a new perspective for pulmonary segment reconstruction. Code and data will be
available at https://github.com/M3DV/ImPulSe.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏穿戴式IMU在3D人体运动估计中存在姿态模糊、数据漂移和适应性不足的问题，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出UMotion框架，结合IMU和UWB传感器，通过UKF实时融合传感器数据与人体运动约束，优化估计结果。

Result: 实验表明UMotion能稳定传感器数据，并在姿态估计精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UMotion通过融合IMU和UWB传感器，有效解决了姿态模糊和数据漂移问题，提升了3D人体运动估计的准确性。

Abstract: Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for
estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data
drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these
issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state
estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six
integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB
sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in
resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with
anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors
are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor
data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF
iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain
human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over
state of the art in pose accuracy.

TL;DR: SALM框架通过语言模型（LMs）改进社交网络模拟，实现长期稳定性和行为保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的代理建模难以捕捉社交系统的细微动态，需要更智能的模拟方法。

Method: 提出SALM框架，包括分层提示架构、注意力记忆系统和人格稳定性边界。

Result: 在SNAP社交网络上验证，实现4000时间步的稳定模拟，内存增长仅9.5%，缓存命中率80%。

Conclusion: SALM是首个基于LLM的框架，能长期模拟社交现象并保持行为真实性。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to agent-based modeling (ABM) of social systems have
traditionally emphasized rule-based behaviors, limiting their ability to
capture nuanced dynamics by moving beyond predefined rules and leveraging
contextual understanding from LMs of human social interaction. This paper
presents SALM (Social Agent LM Framework), a novel approach for integrating
language models (LMs) into social network simulation that achieves
unprecedented temporal stability in multi-agent scenarios. Our primary
contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling
stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2)
an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%,
82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on
personality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks,
we demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term
social phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发逆向设计方法以生成具有特定性能的功能材料，推动可再生能源、催化、能源存储和碳捕获等领域的发展。

Method: 提出InvDesFlow-AL框架，结合主动学习策略迭代优化材料生成过程，逐步引导至目标性能。

Result: 在晶体结构预测中，RMSE为0.0423 Å，性能提升32.96%；成功设计低形成能和低Ehull材料，并发现超导体Li₂AuH₆（Tc=140 K）。

Conclusion: InvDesFlow-AL通过主动学习显著加速材料发现和逆向设计，为材料科学提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific
properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,
energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion
principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance
constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.
However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures
often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel
inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is
based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize
the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired
performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the
InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96%
improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.
Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of
low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate
materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously
expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative
model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove
the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors
under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we
successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor
with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides
strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials
science.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习辅助的无机材料合成提供了数据驱动范式，有望推动新型功能材料的定向发现。

Abstract: Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has
revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often
struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized
through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between
theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a
synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure
derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the
efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable
structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based
synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized
structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab
initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The
framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting
synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the
554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising
synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =
Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$
candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for
experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally
observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a
data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials
synthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational
predictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for
the targeted discovery of novel functional materials.

Result: 建立了在大偏差机制下紧致的误差指数，优于两种基线方法。

Conclusion: 间接观测和信道传输下的统计均值估计在大偏差机制下可实现最优误差指数。

Abstract: We consider a problem of statistical mean estimation in which the samples are
not observed directly, but are instead observed by a relay (``teacher'') that
transmits information through a memoryless channel to the decoder
(``student''), who then produces the final estimate. We consider the minimax
estimation error in the large deviations regime, and establish achievable error
exponents that are tight in broad regimes of the estimation accuracy and
channel quality. In contrast, two natural baseline methods are shown to yield
strictly suboptimal error exponents. We initially focus on Bernoulli sources
and binary symmetric channels, and then generalize to sub-Gaussian and
heavy-tailed settings along with arbitrary discrete memoryless channels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育中的普及，担心其可能绕过学习过程并影响评估的完整性，因此需要了解LLMs在物理问题解决中的能力，以指导其合理应用。

Method: 通过比较GPT-4o（使用不同提示技术）和o1-preview与德国物理奥赛参与者在解决奥赛问题上的表现，分析LLMs的优缺点。

Result: GPT-4o和o1-preview在奥赛类物理问题上表现优于人类参与者，提示技术对GPT-4o影响小，o1-preview表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究为物理教育中如何设计评估以保持完整性并支持学生批判性使用LLMs提供了启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely accessible, reaching learners at
all educational levels. This development has raised concerns that their use may
circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of
established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving
plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential
to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such
understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound
approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study
therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM
(GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model
(o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on
a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the
correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic
strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this
study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate
advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on
average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little
effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently
outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the
study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative
assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity
and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.

Result: 提出了适用于多种特征关系的闭式边界，并通过实证验证框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为敏感特征推断的对抗评估提供了理论支持与实用工具。

Abstract: We propose an adversarial evaluation framework for sensitive feature
inference based on minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation with a finite
sample size and linear predictive models. Our approach establishes theoretical
lower bounds on the true MMSE of inferring sensitive features from noisy
observations of other correlated features. These bounds are expressed in terms
of the empirical MMSE under a restricted hypothesis class and a non-negative
error term. The error term captures both the estimation error due to finite
number of samples and the approximation error from using a restricted
hypothesis class. For linear predictive models, we derive closed-form bounds,
which are order optimal in terms of the noise variance, on the approximation
error for several classes of relationships between the sensitive and
non-sensitive features, including linear mappings, binary symmetric channels,
and class-conditional multi-variate Gaussian distributions. We also present a
new lower bound that relies on the MSE computed on a hold-out validation
dataset of the MMSE estimator learned on finite-samples and a restricted
hypothesis class. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our
framework serves as an effective tool for MMSE-based adversarial evaluation of
sensitive feature inference that balances theoretical guarantees with practical
efficiency.

Abstract: This work examines risk bounds for nonparametric distributional regression
estimators. For convex-constrained distributional regression, general upper
bounds are established for the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and
the worst-case mean squared error (MSE) across the domain. These theoretical
results are applied to isotonic and trend filtering distributional regression,
yielding convergence rates consistent with those for mean estimation.
Furthermore, a general upper bound is derived for distributional regression
under non-convex constraints, with a specific application to neural
network-based estimators. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real
data validate the theoretical contributions, demonstrating their practical
effectiveness.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study online learning of feedforward neural networks with the sign
activation function that implement functions from the unit ball in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ to a finite label set $\{1, \ldots, Y\}$.
  First, we characterize a margin condition that is sufficient and in some
cases necessary for online learnability of a neural network: Every neuron in
the first hidden layer classifies all instances with some margin $\gamma$
bounded away from zero. Quantitatively, we prove that for any net, the optimal
mistake bound is at most approximately $\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma)$, which is the
$(d,\gamma)$-totally-separable-packing number, a more restricted variation of
the standard $(d,\gamma)$-packing number. We complement this result by
constructing a net on which any learner makes $\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma)$ many
mistakes. We also give a quantitative lower bound of approximately
$\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma) \geq \max\{1/(\gamma \sqrt{d})^d, d\}$ when $\gamma \geq
1/2$, implying that for some nets and input sequences every learner will err
for $\exp(d)$ many times, and that a dimension-free mistake bound is almost
always impossible.
  To remedy this inevitable dependence on $d$, it is natural to seek additional
natural restrictions to be placed on the network, so that the dependence on $d$
is removed. We study two such restrictions. The first is the multi-index model,
in which the function computed by the net depends only on $k \ll d$ orthonormal
directions. We prove a mistake bound of approximately $(1.5/\gamma)^{k + 2}$ in
this model. The second is the extended margin assumption. In this setting, we
assume that all neurons (in all layers) in the network classify every ingoing
input from previous layer with margin $\gamma$ bounded away from zero. In this
model, we prove a mistake bound of approximately $(\log Y)/ \gamma^{O(L)}$,
where L is the depth of the network.

Conclusion: 该方法在目标域数据稀疏时表现优异，为基于OT的几何变换下模型适应提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has proven effective for domain adaptation (DA) by
aligning distributions across domains with differing statistical properties.
Building on the approach of Courty et al. (2016), who mapped source data to the
target domain for improved model transfer, we focus on a supervised DA problem
involving linear regression models under rotational shifts. This ongoing work
considers cases where source and target domains are related by a
rotation-common in applications like sensor calibration or image orientation.
We show that in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , when using a p-norm cost with $p $\ge$ 2$, the
optimal transport map recovers the underlying rotation. Based on this, we
propose an algorithm that combines K-means clustering, OT, and singular value
decomposition (SVD) to estimate the rotation angle and adapt the regression
model. This method is particularly effective when the target domain is sparsely
sampled, leveraging abundant source data for improved generalization. Our
contributions offer both theoretical and practical insights into OT-based model
adaptation under geometric transformations.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has become a central topic in machine learning, and
mitigating disparities across different subpopulations has emerged as a rapidly
growing research area. In this paper, we systematically study the
classification of functional data under fairness constraints, ensuring the
disparity level of the classifier is controlled below a pre-specified
threshold. We propose a unified framework for fairness-aware functional
classification, tackling an infinite-dimensional functional space, addressing
key challenges from the absence of density ratios and intractability of
posterior probabilities, and discussing unique phenomena in functional
classification. We further design a post-processing algorithm, Fair Functional
Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier (Fair-FLDA), which targets at
homoscedastic Gaussian processes and achieves fairness via group-wise
thresholding. Under weak structural assumptions on eigenspace, theoretical
guarantees on fairness and excess risk controls are established. As a
byproduct, our results cover the excess risk control of the standard FLDA as a
special case, which, to the best of our knowledge, is first time seen. Our
theoretical findings are complemented by extensive numerical experiments on
synthetic and real datasets, highlighting the practicality of our designed
algorithm.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find optimal policies in dynamic
environments in order to maximize the expected total rewards by leveraging
pre-collected data. Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental
challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal
policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or
homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a
heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline
policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision
processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent
variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and
our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm
guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage
assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real
data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed
method compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Several approaches have been developed to capture the complexity and
nonlinearity of human growth. One widely used is the Super Imposition by
Translation and Rotation (SITAR) model, which has become popular in studies of
adolescent growth. SITAR is a shape-invariant mixed-effects model that
represents the shared growth pattern of a population using a natural cubic
spline mean curve while incorporating three subject-specific random effects --
timing, size, and growth intensity -- to account for variations among
individuals. In this work, we introduce a supervised deep learning framework
based on an autoencoder architecture that integrates a deep neural network
(neural network) with a B-spline model to estimate the SITAR model. In this
approach, the encoder estimates the random effects for each individual, while
the decoder performs a fitting based on B-splines similar to the classic SITAR
model. We refer to this method as the Deep-SITAR model. This innovative
approach enables the prediction of the random effects of new individuals
entering a population without requiring a full model re-estimation. As a
result, Deep-SITAR offers a powerful approach to predicting growth
trajectories, combining the flexibility and efficiency of deep learning with

TL;DR: AWNN是一种自适应加权的最近邻方法，用于矩阵补全，解决了传统最近邻方法中半径和权重选择缺乏系统性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近邻方法在缺失数据问题中广泛应用，但其性能依赖于半径和权重的选择，缺乏无需交叉验证的系统方法。

Method: AWNN通过平衡加权最近邻回归中的偏差-方差权衡，自适应选择半径和权重。

Result: 理论分析和合成实验支持AWNN的有效性。

Conclusion: AWNN为矩阵补全提供了一种无需依赖交叉验证的系统性最近邻方法。

Abstract: In this technical note, we introduce and analyze AWNN: an adaptively weighted
nearest neighbor method for performing matrix completion. Nearest neighbor (NN)
methods are widely used in missing data problems across multiple disciplines
such as in recommender systems and for performing counterfactual inference in
panel data settings. Prior works have shown that in addition to being very
intuitive and easy to implement, NN methods enjoy nice theoretical guarantees.
However, the performance of majority of the NN methods rely on the appropriate
choice of the radii and the weights assigned to each member in the nearest
neighbor set and despite several works on nearest neighbor methods in the past
two decades, there does not exist a systematic approach of choosing the radii
and the weights without relying on methods like cross-validation. AWNN
addresses this challenge by judiciously balancing the bias variance trade off
inherent in weighted nearest-neighbor regression. We provide theoretical
guarantees for the proposed method under minimal assumptions and support the
theory via synthetic experiments.

Abstract: Driver fatigue poses a significant challenge to railway safety, with
traditional systems like the dead-man switch offering limited and basic
alertness checks. This study presents an online behavior-based monitoring
system utilizing a customised Directed-Graph Neural Network (DGNN) to classify
train driver's states into three categories: alert, not alert, and
pathological. To optimize input representations for the model, an ablation
study was performed, comparing three feature configurations: skeletal-only,
facial-only, and a combination of both. Experimental results show that
combining facial and skeletal features yields the highest accuracy (80.88%) in
the three-class model, outperforming models using only facial or skeletal
features. Furthermore, this combination achieves over 99% accuracy in the
binary alertness classification. Additionally, we introduced a novel dataset
that, for the first time, incorporates simulated pathological conditions into
train driver monitoring, broadening the scope for assessing risks related to
fatigue and health. This work represents a step forward in enhancing railway
safety through advanced online monitoring using vision-based technologies.

*Yangyi Chen,Hao Peng,Tong Zhang,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRIOR是一种视觉语言预训练方法，通过差异加权减少噪声拟合和幻觉风险，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准视觉语言模型预训练中，仅部分标记与视觉内容相关，直接最大化联合概率会拟合噪声并增加幻觉风险。

Method: PRIOR通过重要性采样框架，利用文本参考模型对标记进行加权，调整损失函数，优先处理与图像相关的标记。

Result: 在两种设置下，PRIOR分别实现了19%和8%的平均相对改进，并显示出更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: PRIOR通过差异加权显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能和扩展潜力。

Abstract: In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model
typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the
image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of
caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP
unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of
hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach
that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through
differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling
framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model
(LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based
on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly
related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus
receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training,
we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores
to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs
with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8%
average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language
benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling
properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients,
indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given
increasing compute and data.

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法在高精地图构建中具有巨大潜力，挑战了传统密集表示的依赖，重新定义了效率与性能的权衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in high-definition \emph{HD} map construction have
demonstrated the effectiveness of dense representations, which heavily rely on
computationally intensive bird's-eye view \emph{BEV} features. While sparse
representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV
processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored
designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse
representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically
revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key
architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and
ultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network
architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense
segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and
a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through
these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline
detection. Specifically, SparseMeXt-Tiny reaches a mean average precision
\emph{mAP} of 55.5% at 32 frames per second \emph{fps}, while SparseMeXt-Base
attains 65.2% mAP. Scaling the backbone and decoder further, SparseMeXt-Large
achieves an mAP of 68.9% at over 20 fps, establishing a new benchmark for
sparse representations in HD map construction. These results underscore the
untapped potential of sparse methods, challenging the conventional reliance on
dense representations and redefining efficiency-performance trade-offs in the
field.

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向，以进一步推动DNN模型的安全测试。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of artificial
intelligence, and their security-related testing has been a prominent research
focus. By inputting test cases, the behavior of models is examined for
anomalies, and coverage metrics are utilized to determine the extent of neurons
covered by these test cases. With the widespread application and advancement of
DNNs, different types of neural behaviors have garnered attention, leading to
the emergence of various coverage metrics for neural networks. However, there
is currently a lack of empirical research on these coverage metrics,
specifically in analyzing the relationships and patterns between model depth,
configuration information, and neural network coverage. This paper aims to
investigate the relationships and patterns of four coverage metrics: primary
functionality, boundary, hierarchy, and structural coverage. A series of
empirical experiments were conducted, selecting LeNet, VGG, and ResNet as
different DNN architectures, along with 10 models of varying depths ranging
from 5 to 54 layers, to compare and study the relationships between different
depths, configuration information, and various neural network coverage metrics.
Additionally, an investigation was carried out on the relationships between
modified decision/condition coverage and dataset size. Finally, three potential
future directions are proposed to further contribute to the security testing of
DNN Models.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative
technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled
capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal
understanding. This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet
toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable,

survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of
GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the

high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and
cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and
possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases,
evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory
compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing
research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport
integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the

Conclusion: 该方法为现实场景提供了一种低成本、内存高效的视频步态识别解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition, known for its ability to identify individuals from a
distance, has gained significant attention in recent times due to its
non-intrusive verification. While video-based gait identification systems
perform well on large public datasets, their performance drops when applied to
real-world, unconstrained gait data due to various factors. Among these,
uncontrolled outdoor environments, non-overlapping camera views, varying
illumination, and computational efficiency are core challenges in gait-based
authentication. Currently, no dataset addresses all these challenges
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an OptiGait-LGBM model capable of
recognizing person re-identification under these constraints using a skeletal
model approach, which helps mitigate inconsistencies in a person's appearance.
The model constructs a dataset from landmark positions, minimizing memory usage
by using non-sequential data. A benchmark dataset, RUET-GAIT, is introduced to
represent uncontrolled gait sequences in complex outdoor environments. The
process involves extracting skeletal joint landmarks, generating numerical
datasets, and developing an OptiGait-LGBM gait classification model. Our aim is
to address the aforementioned challenges with minimal computational cost
compared to existing methods. A comparative analysis with ensemble techniques
such as Random Forest and CatBoost demonstrates that the proposed approach
outperforms them in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and training time. This
method provides a novel, low-cost, and memory-efficient video-based gait
recognition solution for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于外部多模态模型的SFW采样器，通过条件轨迹校正步骤引导生成远离不安全内容，同时支持用户自定义NSFW类别，实验证明其有效减少不安全生成且对图像质量影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于分数的生成模型（SBM）在图像合成领域表现卓越，但其可能生成不安全内容（如暴力或非自愿裸露）。现有方法多依赖模型自身知识且需微调，本文探索利用外部资源确保生成安全内容。

Method: 提出SFW采样器，采用条件轨迹校正步骤，利用多模态模型（如CLIP）作为条件源，引导样本远离不安全区域，并支持用户自定义NSFW类别。

Result: 实验验证SFW采样器有效减少不安全内容生成，与其他基于微调的方法竞争力相当，且对图像质量影响较小。

Conclusion: SFW采样器适用于对齐的SBM模型，展示了利用模型无关条件防止不良图像的潜力。

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SBM), also known as diffusion models, are the
de facto state of the art for image synthesis. Despite their unparalleled
performance, SBMs have recently been in the spotlight for being tricked into
creating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent images and
non-consensual nudity. Current approaches that prevent unsafe generation are
based on the models' own knowledge, and the majority of them require
fine-tuning. This article explores the use of external sources for ensuring
safe outputs in SBMs. Our safe-for-work (SFW) sampler implements a Conditional
Trajectory Correction step that guides the samples away from undesired regions
in the ambient space using multimodal models as the source of conditioning.
Furthermore, using Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), our method
admits user-defined NSFW classes, which can vary in different settings. Our
experiments on the text-to-image SBM Stable Diffusion validate that the
proposed SFW sampler effectively reduces the generation of explicit content
while being competitive with other fine-tuning-based approaches, as assessed
via independent NSFW detectors. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the SFW
sampler on image quality and show that the proposed correction scheme comes at
a minor cost with negligible effect on samples not needing correction. Our
study confirms the suitability of the SFW sampler towards aligned SBM models
and the potential of using model-agnostic conditioning for the prevention of
unwanted images.

Abstract: Generative AI offers new opportunities for automating urban planning by
creating site-specific urban layouts and enabling flexible design exploration.
However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical
designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion
model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery
conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments.
To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery
with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using
data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion
model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use
configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city
learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of
varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite
imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates
robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban
planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with
design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images.
This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and
highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning
workflows and public engagement.

Abstract: The deployment of traditional deep learning models in high-risk security
tasks in an unlabeled, data-non-exploitable video intelligence environment
faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a lightweight anomaly
detection framework based on color features for surveillance video clips in a
high sensitivity tactical mission, aiming to quickly identify and interpret
potential threat events under resource-constrained and data-sensitive
conditions. The method fuses unsupervised KMeans clustering with RGB channel
histogram modeling to achieve composite detection of structural anomalies and
color mutation signals in key frames. The experiment takes an operation
surveillance video occurring in an African country as a research sample, and
successfully identifies multiple highly anomalous frames related to high-energy
light sources, target presence, and reflective interference under the condition
of no access to the original data. The results show that this method can be
effectively used for tactical assassination warning, suspicious object
screening and environmental drastic change monitoring with strong deployability
and tactical interpretation value. The study emphasizes the importance of color
features as low semantic battlefield signal carriers, and its battlefield
intelligent perception capability will be further extended by combining graph
neural networks and temporal modeling in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PnP方法在泊松逆问题中因假设条件（强凸性或平滑性）不满足而失效，且非扩张性去噪器可能限制性能。

Method: 提出CoCo去噪器，结合哈密顿正则化和谱正则化训练策略，确保其保守性和共轭性，并证明其为弱凸函数的近端算子。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和定量指标上优于相关方法。

Conclusion: CoCo去噪器为PnP方法提供了全局收敛性，并显著提升了泊松逆问题的恢复效果。

Abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods with deep denoisers have shown impressive results
in imaging problems. They typically require strong convexity or smoothness of
the fidelity term and a (residual) non-expansive denoiser for convergence.
These assumptions, however, are violated in Poisson inverse problems, and
non-expansiveness can hinder denoising performance. To address these
challenges, we propose a cocoercive conservative (CoCo) denoiser, which may be
(residual) expansive, leading to improved denoising. By leveraging the
generalized Helmholtz decomposition, we introduce a novel training strategy
that combines Hamiltonian regularization to promote conservativeness and
spectral regularization to ensure cocoerciveness. We prove that CoCo denoiser
is a proximal operator of a weakly convex function, enabling a restoration
model with an implicit weakly convex prior. The global convergence of PnP
methods to a stationary point of this restoration model is established.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms

*Jianlin Sun,Xiaolin Fang,Juwei Guan,Dongdong Gui,Teqi Wang,Tongxin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRRNet提出了一种四阶段架构，通过全局与局部特征融合及反向细化，解决了伪装目标检测中目标与背景相似性高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装目标检测中，目标与背景在颜色、纹理和形状上高度相似，现有方法因依赖全局语义或局部特征而表现不佳。

Method: DRRNet采用四阶段流程：全局上下文特征提取、局部细节补充、双表征融合及反向细化，结合空间边缘先验和频域噪声抑制。

Result: 实验表明，DRRNet在基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRRNet通过多阶段特征融合与细化，有效提升了伪装目标的检测性能。

Abstract: The core challenge in Camouflage Object Detection (COD) lies in the
indistinguishable similarity between targets and backgrounds in terms of color,
texture, and shape. This causes existing methods to either lose edge details
(such as hair-like fine structures) due to over-reliance on global semantic
information or be disturbed by similar backgrounds (such as vegetation
patterns) when relying solely on local features. We propose DRRNet, a
four-stage architecture characterized by a "context-detail-fusion-refinement"
pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context
Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local
Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the
full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual
representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses
panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we
also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors
and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse
refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse
refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and
enhances the continuity of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate
that DRRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jerrySunning/DRRNet.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCS-Attention的新型注意力模块，通过可微分方式选择信息丰富的通道，显著提升了行人重识别任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则，提出一种新的变分上界损失函数，以优化注意力权重计算中的通道选择。

Method: 设计了DCS-Attention模块，支持固定主干网络（DCS-FB）或可学习主干网络（DCS-DNAS），并通过SGD优化IB损失。

Result: 在多个行人重识别基准测试中，DCS-Attention显著提升了DNN的预测准确性。

Conclusion: DCS-Attention模块通过选择最具信息量的通道，有效提升了特征提取的判别性，适用于行人重识别任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel attention module termed the Differentiable
Channel Selection Attention module, or the DCS-Attention module. In contrast
with conventional self-attention, the DCS-Attention module features selection
of informative channels in the computation of the attention weights. The
selection of the feature channels is performed in a differentiable manner,
enabling seamless integration with DNN training. Our DCS-Attention is
compatible with either fixed neural network backbones or learnable backbones
with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS), leading to DCS with
Fixed Backbone (DCS-FB) and DCS-DNAS, respectively. Importantly, our
DCS-Attention is motivated by the principle of Information Bottleneck (IB), and
a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss, which can be optimized by SGD,
is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the networks with the
DCS-Attention modules. In this manner, a neural network with DCS-Attention
modules is capable of selecting the most informative channels for feature
extraction so that it enjoys state-of-the-art performance for the Re-ID task.
Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks using both DCS-FB and
DCS-DNAS show that DCS-Attention significantly enhances the prediction accuracy
of DNNs for person Re-ID, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DCS-Attention
in learning discriminative features critical to identifying person identities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AnoGen的少样本异常生成方法，通过扩散模型生成真实多样的异常样本，提升异常检测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测中异常样本稀缺，现有方法生成的异常与真实异常存在语义差距，导致检测性能不佳。

Method: 分三阶段：1) 学习异常分布并嵌入知识；2) 利用嵌入和边界框指导扩散模型生成异常；3) 弱监督训练异常检测模型。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，DRAEM和DesTSeg的AU-PR指标分别提升了5.8%和1.5%。

Conclusion: AnoGen能有效生成真实异常样本，显著提升异常检测模型的分类和分割性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of
anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection
methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external
data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and
real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To
solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen)
method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse
anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly
detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the
first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real
anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second
stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion
model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or
textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection
method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method
builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments
on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The
experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the
model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks
simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement
in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively. The code and generated
anomalous data are available at https://github.com/gaobb/AnoGen.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，结合CGM数据、人口统计/微生物组数据和餐前食物图像，显著提高了热量估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计热量摄入对2型糖尿病管理至关重要，但现有方法（如CGM）因个体和餐食差异而受限。

Method: 采用注意力编码和卷积特征提取处理食物图像，多层感知器处理CGM和微生物组数据，并通过后期融合策略联合推理。

Result: 在40多名参与者的数据集上，模型RMSRE为0.2544，优于基线模型50%以上。

Conclusion: 多模态传感技术有望提升慢性病管理的自动化饮食评估工具。

Abstract: Effective dietary monitoring is critical for managing Type 2 diabetes, yet
accurately estimating caloric intake remains a major challenge. While
continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they
often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to
inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a
multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data,
Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation.
Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature
extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome
data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our
approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating
synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with
standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative
Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These
findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated
dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自注意力重建模型在统一异常检测中可能因完美重建正常和异常特征而失效，且低分辨率潜在空间导致异常分割不准确。

Method: 提出OneNIP方法，仅需一张正常图像提示即可重建或恢复异常特征，并引入监督细化器通过真实正常和合成异常图像回归重建误差。

Result: 在MVTec、BTAD和VisA三个工业异常检测基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OneNIP通过简单有效的方法解决了现有模型的局限性，显著提升了统一异常检测的性能和分割精度。

Abstract: Unsupervised reconstruction networks using self-attention transformers have
achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-class (unified) anomaly
detection with a single model. However, these self-attention reconstruction
models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect
reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency
with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these
models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing
reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable
reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their
generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective
method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with
just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP
allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one
normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection
performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses
reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous
images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP
outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks:
MVTec, BTAD, and VisA. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: MetaUAS首次实现了无需语言模型和特定数据集的通用异常分割，仅需一张正常图像提示即可高效分割任何异常。

Abstract: Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful
vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed
textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of
language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation
model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal
visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly
segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage
large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region
changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target
anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal
Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and
then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the
real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images,
we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change
perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to
achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without
relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language
models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only
one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from
language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot,
and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. The code and pre-trained
models are available at https://github.com/gaobb/MetaUAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频编解码标准（如AVC、HEVC等）依赖手工设计的特征，而神经视频编解码（NVC）通过学习内容感知的压缩策略，提供了更高的压缩效率和适应性。然而，其高计算需求限制了实时应用（如视频会议）。

Method: 提出了一种基于2D高斯泼溅的ROI神经视频压缩模型，通过内容感知初始化策略和新型高斯帧间冗余减少机制，显著提升了编码速度。

Result: 模型将基于高斯泼溅的图像编解码器的编码时间缩短了88%，首次实现了高斯泼溅在神经视频编解码中的应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经视频编解码领域提供了首个基于高斯泼溅的解决方案，具有在实时视频应用中（如视频会议）的潜力。

Abstract: The computer vision and image processing research community has been involved
in standardizing video data communications for the past many decades, leading
to standards such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1, AV2, etc. However, recent
groundbreaking works have focused on employing deep learning-based techniques
to replace the traditional video codec pipeline to a greater affect. Neural
video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on
any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn
content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher
compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential
not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms
and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams
or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However,
their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time
applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a
region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D
Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable
of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring
only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions
in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the
encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by
using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian
inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be
used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural
video codec space.

Abstract: Scaling up model and data size have demonstrated impressive performance
improvement over a wide range of tasks. Despite extensive studies on scaling
behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial
differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing
medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive
understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we
explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data
sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation
models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we
introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a
wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that
scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis
reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose
BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million
biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation
models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling
up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data
diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical
considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.

Abstract: Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical
deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology
software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and
refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of
running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused
on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI)
designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.
  Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI
models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and
hospital-wide radiology information systems. A pragmatic investigation was
deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency
Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or
patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification
performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model
retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model,
significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and
segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training
VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in
classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that
reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire
sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873).
Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the
value of real-time radiologist feedback.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedSaaS的新型联邦分割框架，通过类样本和对比损失解决语义分割中的类一致性表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在处理异构问题（如域偏移）时忽略了语义空间中细粒度的类关系，导致类表示模糊。

Method: 引入类样本作为局部和全局类表示的准则，服务器端建模类原型监督客户端全局分支，客户端通过对抗机制协调全局和局部分支，并采用多级对比损失。

Result: 在多个驾驶场景分割数据集上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了平均分割精度，有效解决了类一致性表示问题。

Conclusion: FedSaaS框架通过类样本和对比损失，成功解决了联邦语义分割中的类一致性表示问题。

Abstract: Federated semantic segmentation enables pixel-level classification in images
through collaborative learning while maintaining data privacy. However,
existing research commonly overlooks the fine-grained class relationships
within the semantic space when addressing heterogeneous problems, particularly
domain shift. This oversight results in ambiguities between class
representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated
segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS.
Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and
global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class
exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global
branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the
client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions
of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover,
multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency
between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive
experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average
segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency
representation problem.

Conclusion: Endo-CLIP为更准确和临床相关的内窥镜分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-training on image-text colonoscopy records offers substantial potential
for improving endoscopic image analysis, but faces challenges including
non-informative background images, complex medical terminology, and ambiguous
multi-lesion descriptions. We introduce Endo-CLIP, a novel self-supervised
framework that enhances Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for this
domain. Endo-CLIP's three-stage framework--cleansing, attunement, and
unification--addresses these challenges by (1) removing background frames, (2)
leveraging large language models to extract clinical attributes for
fine-grained contrastive learning, and (3) employing patient-level
cross-attention to resolve multi-polyp ambiguities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Endo-CLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
pre-training methods in zero-shot and few-shot polyp detection and
classification, paving the way for more accurate and clinically relevant
endoscopic analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的2D语义感知位置编码方法（SaPE²），解决了传统位置编码在图像任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法（如绝对或相对位置编码）主要关注1D线性位置关系，忽视了图像块之间的语义相似性，限制了模型的泛化能力和翻译等变性。

Method: 提出SaPE²方法，动态调整位置表示，利用局部内容而非固定的线性位置关系或空间坐标。

Result: SaPE²提高了模型在不同图像分辨率和尺度下的泛化能力，增强了翻译等变性，并更好地聚合了视觉相似但空间距离较远的图像块特征。

Conclusion: SaPE²通过结合位置编码和感知相似性，提升了视觉Transformer在计算机视觉任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision transformers have demonstrated significant advantages in computer
vision tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and
contextual relationships through self-attention. However, existing position
encoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language
processing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships
between image patches. Traditional approaches like absolute position encoding
and relative position encoding primarily focus on 1D linear position
relationship, often neglecting the semantic similarity between distant yet
contextually related patches. These limitations hinder model generalization,
translation equivariance, and the ability to effectively handle repetitive or
structured patterns in images. In this paper, we propose 2-Dimensional
Semantic-Aware Position Encoding ($\text{SaPE}^2$), a novel position encoding
method with semantic awareness that dynamically adapts position representations
by leveraging local content instead of fixed linear position relationship or
spatial coordinates. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize
across varying image resolutions and scales, improves translation equivariance,
and better aggregates features for visually similar but spatially distant
patches. By integrating $\text{SaPE}^2$ into vision transformers, we bridge the
gap between position encoding and perceptual similarity, thereby improving
performance on computer vision tasks.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable biodiversity monitoring methods has fuelled
interest in remote sensing data, due to its widespread availability and
extensive coverage. Traditionally, the application of remote sensing to
biodiversity research has focused on mapping and monitoring habitats, but with
increasing availability of large-scale citizen-science wildlife observation
data, recent methods have started to explore predicting multi-species presence
directly from satellite images. This paper presents a new data set for
predicting butterfly species presence from satellite data in the United
Kingdom. We experimentally optimise a Resnet-based model to predict
multi-species presence from 4-band satellite images, and find that this model
especially outperforms the mean rate baseline for locations with high species
biodiversity. To improve performance, we develop a soft, supervised contrastive
regularisation loss that is tailored to probabilistic labels (such as
species-presence data), and demonstrate that this improves prediction accuracy.
In summary, our new data set and contrastive regularisation method contribute
to the open challenge of accurately predicting species biodiversity from remote
sensing data, which is key for efficient biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Flash-VL 2B, a novel approach to optimizing
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for real-time applications, targeting ultra-low

Abstract: Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in
recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image
understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and
training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain
underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and
diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a
comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis
on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies.
Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a
diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in
contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both
higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first
training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers
practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while
developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a
high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by
prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes,
objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design,
training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art
unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of
the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks.
To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code,
model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning
datasets.

Conclusion: Marigold展示了从生成模型中提取知识并迁移到密集视觉任务的潜力，为数据稀缺场景下的模型预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in computer vision over the past decade has
hinged on large labeled datasets and strong pretrained models. In data-scarce
settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective
transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have
traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and
transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative
models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has
introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned
image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen
content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this
work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a
fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent
diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis
tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and
intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the
pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic
datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art
zero-shot generalization. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种变分学习方法（IVON）用于提升多模态模型的可靠性，显著改善了校准性和覆盖范围，尤其在分布偏移情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在视觉问答（VQA）中取得了显著进展，但其在分布外（OOD）场景中的可靠性和校准性仍存在问题。目前针对单模态模型的研究较多，但多模态模型的可靠性问题尚未得到充分解决。

Method: 采用变分算法IVON替代传统的AdamW优化器，通过生成模型参数的后验分布来提升模型的可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持AdamW准确性的同时，显著降低了预期校准误差（超过50%），并在分布偏移情况下提升了覆盖范围（8%）。

Conclusion: 变分学习是提升多模态模型可靠性的有效方法，尤其在分布偏移场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in multimodal models for Visual Question
Answering (VQA), there remain major reliability concerns because the models can
often be overconfident and miscalibrated, especially in out-of-distribution
(OOD) settings. Plenty has been done to address such issues for unimodal
models, but little work exists for multimodal cases. Here, we address
unreliability in multimodal models by proposing a Variational VQA approach.
Specifically, instead of fine-tuning vision-language models by using AdamW, we
employ a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON, which yields a
posterior distribution over model parameters. Through extensive experiments, we
show that our approach improves calibration and abstentions without sacrificing
the accuracy of AdamW. For instance, compared to AdamW fine-tuning, we reduce
Expected Calibration Error by more than 50% compared to the AdamW baseline and
raise Coverage by 4% vs. SOTA (for a fixed risk of 1%). In the presence of
distribution shifts, the performance gain is even higher, achieving 8% Coverage
(@ 1% risk) improvement vs. SOTA when 50% of test cases are OOD. Overall, we
present variational learning as a viable option to enhance the reliability of
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSpring是一个新的计算机视觉基准测试，专注于评估光流、场景流和立体视觉模型对图像损坏的鲁棒性，填补了现有基准测试在鲁棒性评估上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注模型准确性，而忽略了模型对噪声、雨等现实世界扰动的鲁棒性。RobustSpring旨在量化模型对这些扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过在高分辨率Spring数据集上应用20种不同的图像损坏（如噪声、模糊、颜色变化等），生成20,000张损坏图像，并设计新的鲁棒性评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，准确性高的模型不一定鲁棒，且鲁棒性因损坏类型而异。

Conclusion: RobustSpring将鲁棒性作为首要目标，推动模型在准确性和鲁棒性上的平衡发展。

Abstract: Standard benchmarks for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo vision
algorithms generally focus on model accuracy rather than robustness to image
corruptions like noise or rain. Hence, the resilience of models to such
real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present
RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness
to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models.
RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur,
color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-,
stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset,
creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging
conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new
corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables
public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a
curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not
necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type.
RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a
first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It
will be available at https://spring-benchmark.org.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索事件相机在捕捉高动态范围和时间分辨率信息方面的优势，用于无接触心率监测。

Method: 使用监督式CNN模型从事件流中提取心率信号，评估模型性能基于心率计算的准确性。

Result: 事件相机模型在60和120 FPS下表现优于传统相机，RMSE分别为2.54和2.13 bpm。

Conclusion: 事件相机在心率监测中具有潜力，尤其是在高帧率下表现更优。

Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at
extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a
stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within
the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal
resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free
reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event
recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)
model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a
two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance
evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental
results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is
effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this
novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event
frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm)
compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on
standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated
at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an
RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在肿瘤学中应用上下文学习（ICL）作为替代模型重新训练的方法，通过少量标记示例使模型适应新任务，并在多个视觉语言模型上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在肿瘤学中的应用受限于对大规模标注数据和模型重新训练的依赖，研究旨在探索ICL作为替代方案的可行性。

Method: 使用四种视觉语言模型（Paligemma、CLIP、ALIGN和GPT-4o）在三个肿瘤学数据集（MHIST、PatchCamelyon和HAM10000）上评估ICL的性能。

Result: 所有模型在少样本提示下均表现显著提升，GPT-4o在二分类和多分类任务中分别达到F1分数0.81和0.60。开源模型如Paligemma和CLIP也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: ICL展示了在肿瘤学中的实用潜力，尤其适用于罕见癌症和资源受限的环境，避免了重新训练和大量标注数据的需求。

Abstract: The application of AI in oncology has been limited by its reliance on large,
annotated datasets and the need for retraining models for domain-specific
diagnostic tasks. Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context
learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to
adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference,
without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models
(VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across
three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs
on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all
models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching
an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class
classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully
fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate
task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how
clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like
Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size,
suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical
environments. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of ICL as a
practical solution in oncology, particularly for rare cancers and
resource-limited contexts where fine-tuning is infeasible and annotated data is
difficult to obtain.

Motivation: 超声报告生成因图像变异性、操作依赖性和标准化文本需求而具有挑战性，且缺乏一致的数据集。

Method: 整合片段化多语言训练，利用标准化报告特性，通过模块化文本片段与多样化图像数据对齐，并构建双语数据集。采用选择性解冻视觉变换器（ViT）微调以优化文本-图像对齐。

Result: 相比KMVE方法，BLEU分数提升约2%，ROUGE-L提升约3%，CIDEr提升约15%，显著减少错误内容。

Conclusion: 该框架在多器官和多语言报告生成中表现出色，具备实际临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) report generation is a challenging task due to the
variability of US images, operator dependence, and the need for standardized
text. Unlike X-ray and CT, US imaging lacks consistent datasets, making
automation difficult. In this study, we propose a unified framework for
multi-organ and multilingual US report generation, integrating fragment-based
multilingual training and leveraging the standardized nature of US reports. By
aligning modular text fragments with diverse imaging data and curating a
bilingual English-Chinese dataset, the method achieves consistent and
clinically accurate text generation across organ sites and languages.
Fine-tuning with selective unfreezing of the vision transformer (ViT) further
improves text-image alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art KMVE
method, our approach achieves relative gains of about 2\% in BLEU scores,
approximately 3\% in ROUGE-L, and about 15\% in CIDEr, while significantly
reducing errors such as missing or incorrect content. By unifying multi-organ
and multi-language report generation into a single, scalable framework, this
work demonstrates strong potential for real-world clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 共形预测需进一步改进以生成更真实、实用的预测集，并提高对模糊和分布外数据的识别能力。

Abstract: Deep learning based cervical cancer classification can potentially increase
access to screening in low-resource regions. However, deep learning models are
often overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty.
Moreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood
predictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results.
Such challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic
framework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for
trained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model
uncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing
conformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set
includes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous
classes. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end
users, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations
rather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely
classes. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets
using expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate
three conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models
trained for cervical atypia classification. Our expert annotation-based
analysis reveals that conventional coverage-based evaluations overestimate
performance and that current conformal prediction methods often produce
prediction sets that are not well aligned with human labels. Additionally, we
explore the capabilities of the conformal prediction methods in identifying
ambiguous and out-of-distribution data.

Result: 在模拟和临床MRI脑数据实验中，重建质量显著提升，尤其在严重运动情况下，重建时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 该方法在严重运动损坏下优于现有技术，具有更高的重建质量和效率。

Abstract: High-resolution slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) from multiple
motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D slices constitutes a critical step in
image-based diagnostics of moving subjects, such as fetal brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions struggle with image artifacts and
severe subject motion or require slice pre-alignment to achieve satisfying
reconstruction performance. We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and
accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion
corruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and
super-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on
implicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with
task-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either
simulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480
reconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different
centers, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion
and image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction
quality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to
state-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time.

Abstract: Industrial catastrophes like the Bhopal disaster (1984) and the Aliso Canyon
gas leak (2015) demonstrate the urgent need for rapid and reliable plume
tracing algorithms to protect public health and the environment. Traditional
methods, such as gradient-based or biologically inspired approaches, often fail
in realistic, turbulent conditions. To address these challenges, we present a
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm designed for localizing
multiple airborne pollution sources using a swarm of small uncrewed aerial
systems (sUAS). Our method models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov
Game (POMG), employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Action-specific
Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADDRQN) that uses full sequences of historical
action-observation pairs, effectively approximating latent states. Unlike prior
work, we use a general-purpose simulation environment based on the Gaussian
Plume Model (GPM), incorporating realistic elements such as a three-dimensional
environment, sensor noise, multiple interacting agents, and multiple plume
sources. The incorporation of action histories as part of the inputs further
enhances the adaptability of our model in complex, partially observable
environments. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm significantly
outperforms conventional approaches. Specifically, our model allows agents to
explore only 1.29\% of the environment to successfully locate pollution
sources.

Conclusion: TensorRL-QAS是一种高效且可扩展的量子电路设计方法，适用于近期量子硬件。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum
problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, but they face
the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem
and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates
this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising
approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues,
as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits,
circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that
combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By
warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation
of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to
physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired
solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit,
TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth
compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical
accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates
training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success
probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $<1\%$ rates of baseline
approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless
and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These
advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and
efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Typhoon trajectory forecasting is essential for disaster preparedness but
remains computationally demanding due to the complexity of atmospheric dynamics
and the resource requirements of deep learning models. Quantum-Train (QT), a
hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks
(QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training,
eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's
success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement

introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting
model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA
enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy.
This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to
large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and

trade-off in reinforcement learning to develop adaptive strategies achieving
energy dissipation that scales only poly-logarithmically in $N$. This
represents an exponential improvement over current protocols based on full

TL;DR: 论文提出了WavReward，一种基于音频语言模型的奖励反馈模型，用于评估语音对话系统的IQ和EQ表现，并在多个场景中显著优于现有评估模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音对话模型（如GPT-4o-audio）的评估主要依赖文本信息，忽略了非文本信息的重要性，因此需要一种能够全面评估语音对话性能的方法。

Method: 1) 基于音频语言模型，WavReward结合深度推理过程和非线性奖励机制进行后训练；2) 引入ChatReward-30K数据集，用于训练WavReward，涵盖多种语音对话任务。

Result: WavReward在客观准确率上从55.1%提升至91.5%，在主观A/B测试中以83%的优势领先。

Conclusion: WavReward通过结合音频语言模型和多任务数据集，显著提升了语音对话系统的评估性能，验证了其各组件的必要性。

Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered
significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken
dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This
is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual
information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models
like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback
model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of
spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio
language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the
nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample
feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized
evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a
preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both
comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios
span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of
instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous
state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios,
achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy
from 55.1$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a
margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each
component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at
https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在T2T基因组组装中使用BPE标记化的效果，发现共享标记较少且物种特异性重复元素影响系统发育分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基因组序列的有效标记化策略，以支持比较基因组学。

Method: 使用BPE标记化工具dnaBPE，对9个T2T灵长类基因组进行标记化分析。

Result: 共享标记仅11,569个，而近991,854个标记为单基因组特有；系统发育树未能反映已知关系。

Conclusion: BPE标记化在压缩重复序列时有效，但需结合混合策略和重复屏蔽以改进基因组语言模型。

Abstract: The emergence of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies has opened new
avenues for comparative genomics, yet effective tokenization strategies for
genomic sequences remain underexplored. In this pilot study, we apply Byte Pair
Encoding (BPE) to nine T2T primate genomes including three human assemblies by
training independent BPE tokenizers with a fixed vocabulary of 512,000 tokens
using our custom tool, dnaBPE. Our analysis reveals that only 11,569 tokens are
shared across all assemblies, while nearly 991,854 tokens are unique to a
single genome, indicating a rapid decline in shared vocabulary with increasing
assembly comparisons. Moreover, phylogenetic trees derived from token overlap
failed to recapitulate established primate relationships, a discrepancy
attributed to the disproportionate influence of species-specific high-copy
repetitive elements. These findings underscore the dual nature of BPE
tokenization: while it effectively compresses repetitive sequences, its
sensitivity to high-copy elements limits its utility as a universal tool for
comparative genomics. We discuss potential hybrid strategies and repeat-masking
approaches to refine genomic tokenization, emphasizing the need for
domain-specific adaptations in the development of large-scale genomic language
models. The dnaBPE tool used in this study is open-source and available at

*Hongxin Xiang,Ke Li,Mingquan Liu,Zhixiang Cheng,Bin Yao,Wenjie Du,Jun Xia,Li Zeng,Xin Jin,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了EDBench，一个大规模、高质量的电子密度数据集，旨在推动电子尺度的学习研究，并通过实验验证了其可行性和高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子机器学习力场（MLFFs）通常忽略电子密度（ED）的重要性，而ED对准确理解分子力场至关重要。由于ED计算依赖耗时的第一性原理密度泛函理论（DFT），缺乏大规模ED数据限制了其在MLFFs中的应用。

Method: 基于PCQM4Mv2构建EDBench数据集，提供330万个分子的精确ED数据，并设计了一套以ED为中心的基准任务（预测、检索和生成）来评估模型能力。

Result: 实验表明，基于EDBench的学习不仅可行，还能达到高精度，且计算成本显著低于传统DFT计算。

Conclusion: EDBench为电子密度驱动的药物发现和材料科学奠定了坚实基础，所有数据和基准将免费公开。

Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on
the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such
as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED)
$\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED
describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around
atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such
as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems
according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies
on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which
leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs.
In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED
designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon
the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million
molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and
utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks
spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only
feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based
method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while
significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT
calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available,
laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个透明、可解释且易于非专家使用的文本分类系统，减少传统分类系统所需的监督，并降低幻觉风险。

Method: 使用“分类学引导推理”方法，结合人类编写的决策树和大语言模型。

Result: Ornithologist对RBA沟通的鹰派和鸽派倾向测量能够预测未来现金利率路径和市场预期。

Conclusion: Ornithologist是一个高效且适应性强的文本分类工具，适用于多种文本源和问题。

Abstract: I develop Ornithologist, a weakly-supervised textual classification system
and measure the hawkishness and dovishness of central bank text. Ornithologist
uses ``taxonomy-guided reasoning'', guiding a large language model with
human-authored decision trees. This increases the transparency and
explainability of the system and makes it accessible to non-experts. It also
reduces hallucination risk. Since it requires less supervision than traditional
classification systems, it can more easily be applied to other problems or
sources of text (e.g. news) without much modification. Ornithologist
measurements of hawkishness and dovishness of RBA communication carry
information about the future of the cash rate path and of market expectations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经电路图的系统方法，用于自动开发高效的人工智能架构，并通过球形注意力算法和FlashSign内核验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动编译方法效率低下，高效算法需要多年人工开发。本文旨在通过神经电路图提供一种系统方法，以改进深度学习架构的自动开发。

Method: 利用基于范畴论的神经电路图，提出了一种球形注意力算法，并开发了高效的FlashSign内核。

Result: 球形注意力算法克服了标准注意力的瓶颈，FlashSign内核在A100上性能与FlashAttention相当，比PyTorch快3.6倍。

Conclusion: 神经电路图适合作为自动开发高效、新颖人工智能架构的高层框架。

Abstract: How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This
is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence
models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains
in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current
automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years
of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in
category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning
algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the
domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient
kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural
circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about
deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing
SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special
function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming
property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived
\textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and
$3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows
neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the
automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence
architectures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RT-cache是一种新型轨迹记忆管道，通过大数据检索和经验学习加速机器人实时推理，显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型虽然能处理多样机器人任务，但单步推理成本高，导致显著延迟。RT-cache旨在通过存储和检索成功轨迹片段解决这一问题。

Method: RT-cache结合Memory Builder和Trajectory Retrieval，高效检索大规模数据集中的多步运动片段，快速适应新环境。

Result: 实验表明，RT-cache在Open-X Embodiment Dataset等数据上完成任务更快且更成功，优于无检索的基线方法。

Conclusion: RT-cache为实时操作提供了一种实用的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces RT-cache, a novel trajectorymemory pipeline that
accelerates real-world robot inference by leveraging big-data retrieval and
learning from experience. While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can
handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs,
resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast,
RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot
trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically
reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory
Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable
even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world
experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states,
adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional
samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data
demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully
than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution
for real-time manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主机器人系统的成熟，用户希望通过自然语言而非低层细节指定任务。然而，实现语言引导的机器人团队需克服语义推理、异构机器人协调和间歇通信等技术难题。

Method: 系统采用LLM支持的规划器，在线构建并共享语义-度量地图，支持动态任务调整。任务涉及城市和乡村环境中的导航，需推理任务相关语义并主动获取信息。

Result: 在七种不同自然语言任务中，系统成功实现了千米级导航，验证了其在地面和空地协作任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统首次实现了自然语言引导的无人机与无人地面车辆协作任务，展示了语言引导异构机器人团队的潜力。

Abstract: As autonomous robotic systems become increasingly mature, users will want to
specify missions at the level of intent rather than in low-level detail.
Language is an expressive and intuitive medium for such mission specification.
However, realizing language-guided robotic teams requires overcoming
significant technical hurdles. Interpreting and realizing language-specified
missions requires advanced semantic reasoning. Successful heterogeneous robots
must effectively coordinate actions and share information across varying
viewpoints. Additionally, communication between robots is typically
intermittent, necessitating robust strategies that leverage communication
opportunities to maintain coordination and achieve mission objectives. In this
work, we present a first-of-its-kind system where an unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) are able to collaboratively
accomplish missions specified in natural language while reacting to changes in
specification on the fly. We leverage a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled
planner to reason over semantic-metric maps that are built online and
opportunistically shared between an aerial and a ground robot. We consider
task-driven navigation in urban and rural areas. Our system must infer
mission-relevant semantics and actively acquire information via semantic
mapping. In both ground and air-ground teaming experiments, we demonstrate our
system on seven different natural-language specifications at up to
kilometer-scale navigation.

Motivation: 传统吸盘和脚本化动作在处理易变形、解剖学差异大的鸡胴体时不可靠，需要一种更灵活、可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用双爪气动夹持器和条件扩散策略控制器，通过50次多视角遥操作演示训练，实现5自由度末端执行器运动规划。

Result: 系统抓取成功率为40.6%，完成一次抓取到悬挂的周期为38秒，优于现有方法（IBC和LSTM-GMM）。

Conclusion: ChicGrasp展示了模仿学习在农业工程和机器人学习中的潜力，提供了可复现的基准和公开数据集。

Abstract: Automated poultry processing lines still rely on humans to lift slippery,
easily bruised carcasses onto a shackle conveyor. Deformability, anatomical
variance, and strict hygiene rules make conventional suction and scripted
motions unreliable. We present ChicGrasp, an end--to--end hardware--software
co-design for this task. An independently actuated dual-jaw pneumatic gripper
clamps both chicken legs, while a conditional diffusion-policy controller,
trained from only 50 multi--view teleoperation demonstrations (RGB +
proprioception), plans 5 DoF end--effector motion, which includes jaw commands
in one shot. On individually presented raw broiler carcasses, our system
achieves a 40.6\% grasp--and--lift success rate and completes the pick to
shackle cycle in 38 s, whereas state--of--the--art implicit behaviour cloning
(IBC) and LSTM-GMM baselines fail entirely. All CAD, code, and datasets will be
open-source. ChicGrasp shows that imitation learning can bridge the gap between
rigid hardware and variable bio--products, offering a reproducible benchmark
and a public dataset for researchers in agricultural engineering and robot

Conclusion: 该方法能有效补偿特定肌肉缺陷，提升康复效果。

Abstract: The use of wearable robots has been widely adopted in rehabilitation training
for patients with hand motor impairments. However, the uniqueness of patients'
muscle loss is often overlooked. Leveraging reinforcement learning and a
biologically accurate musculoskeletal model in simulation, we propose a
customized wearable robotic controller that is able to address specific muscle
deficits and to provide compensation for hand-object manipulation tasks. Video
data of a same subject performing human grasping tasks is used to train a
manipulation model through learning from demonstration. This manipulation model
is subsequently fine-tuned to perform object-specific interaction tasks. The
muscle forces in the musculoskeletal manipulation model are then weakened to
simulate neurological motor impairments, which are later compensated by the
actuation of a virtual wearable robotics glove. Results shows that integrating
the virtual wearable robotic glove provides shared assistance to support the
hand manipulator with weakened muscle forces. The learned exoglove controller
achieved an average of 90.5\% of the original manipulation proficiency.

Method: 提出了SPINE框架，支持大规模LLM驱动的机器人规划，并通过模型蒸馏实现小型语言模型在资源受限平台上的运行。

Result: 展示了首个在非结构化环境中实现数公里任务的LLM驱动机器人规划，并首次实现了基于设备端语言模型的无人机规划。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的多个方向，强调了在非结构化环境中部署FMs的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has enabled robots
to understand natural language and reason about the semantics in their
environments. However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in
closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full
view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots
in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale
and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots
must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain,
handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We
discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in
field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first
demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured
environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a
particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of
running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via
preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven
UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing
several promising directions for future research.

high-quality diverse trajectories, we introduce a simple yet effective

Motivation: 长序列的观察和动作推理对机器人任务至关重要，但现有方法因内存需求和虚假相关性导致性能下降。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出PTP辅助任务，预测历史动作标记；采用多阶段训练策略，先预训练视觉编码器，再微调策略头；引入自验证机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将长上下文扩散策略性能提升3倍，训练速度加快10倍以上。

Conclusion: PTP和多阶段训练策略有效解决了长上下文策略学习的挑战，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for
many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from
demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training
becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy
performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods
typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding
historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this
paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the
retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in
imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion
policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture
essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we
introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy
learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization
significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal
reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further
introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with
short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context
embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing
memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a
self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and
select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments
across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed
method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and
accelerates policy training by more than 10x.

TL;DR: Mini-Diffuser是一种高效的多任务视觉语言机器人扩散策略训练方法，通过Level-2 minibatching显著减少训练时间和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练多任务扩散策略时计算成本高，Mini-Diffuser旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Level-2 minibatching策略，将多个噪声动作样本与每个视觉语言条件配对，并对扩散变压器进行架构调整以防止信息泄漏。

Result: 在RLBench模拟中，性能达到SOTA的95%，训练时间和内存使用分别减少至5%和7%。

Conclusion: Mini-Diffuser在保持扩散策略优势的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion
policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude.
This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between
action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image
generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much
lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action
generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this
asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised
action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional
one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce
architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information
leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench
simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and
7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser
preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability
to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on
diverse perceptual inputs. Code available at

access the teacher's state space, leading to distributional shifts and policy
degradation. Existing approaches either modify the teacher to produce
realizable but sub-optimal demonstrations or rely on the student to explore
missing information independently, both of which are inefficient. Our key
insight is that the student should strategically interact with the teacher
--querying only when necessary and resetting from recovery states --to stay on
a recoverable path within its own observation space. We introduce two methods:
(i) an imitation learning approach that adaptively determines when the student
should query the teacher for corrections, and (ii) a reinforcement learning
approach that selects where to initialize training for efficient exploration.
We validate our methods in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks,
demonstrating significant improvements over standard teacher-student baselines
in training efficiency and final performance. The project website is available

Conclusion: 端到端、性能感知的数据选择对释放大型数据集潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recently, the robotics community has amassed ever larger and more diverse
datasets to train generalist robot policies. However, while these policies
achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often
underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on
newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully
curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better
specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream
performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data
selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data
selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which
data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that
filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual
similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success,
allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that
degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during
selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data,
allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We
validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world
manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the
Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and
superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the
importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the
potential of large prior datasets in robotics. More information at

TL;DR: ELIS是一个用于大型语言模型（LLM）的服务系统，采用迭代最短剩余时间优先（ISRTF）调度器，通过预测剩余令牌数优化任务调度，减少平均任务完成时间达19.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统采用先到先服务调度策略，易导致“队头阻塞”问题，需通过预测推理时间并应用最短作业优先策略来优化。

Method: 训练基于BGE模型的响应长度预测器，设计ISRTF调度策略，并在Kubernetes上实现云原生调度系统。

Result: 实验表明，ISRTF将平均任务完成时间减少高达19.6%。

Conclusion: ELIS通过ISRTF调度策略有效解决了LLM服务中的调度问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: We propose ELIS, a serving system for Large Language Models (LLMs) featuring
an Iterative Shortest Remaining Time First (ISRTF) scheduler designed to
efficiently manage inference tasks with the shortest remaining tokens. Current
LLM serving systems often employ a first-come-first-served scheduling strategy,
which can lead to the "head-of-line blocking" problem. To overcome this
limitation, it is necessary to predict LLM inference times and apply a shortest
job first scheduling strategy. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of
LLMs, predicting the inference latency is challenging. ELIS addresses this
challenge by training a response length predictor for LLMs using the BGE model,
an encoder-based state-of-the-art model. Additionally, we have devised the
ISRTF scheduling strategy, an optimization of shortest remaining time first
tailored to existing LLM iteration batching. To evaluate our work in an
industrial setting, we simulate streams of requests based on our study of
real-world user LLM serving trace records. Furthermore, we implemented ELIS as
a cloud-native scheduler system on Kubernetes to evaluate its performance in
production environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that ISRTF
reduces the average job completion time by up to 19.6%.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has unveiled critical
limitations in current hardware architectures, including constraints in memory
capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnection bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3,
trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model

the DeepSeek-V3/R1 model architecture and its AI infrastructure, highlighting
key innovations such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for enhanced memory

computation-communication trade-offs, FP8 mixed-precision training to unlock
the full potential of hardware capabilities, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology
to minimize cluster-level network overhead. Building on the hardware
bottlenecks encountered during DeepSeek-V3's development, we engage in a
broader discussion with academic and industry peers on potential future
hardware directions, including precise low-precision computation units,
scale-up and scale-out convergence, and innovations in low-latency
communication fabrics. These insights underscore the critical role of hardware
and model co-design in meeting the escalating demands of AI workloads, offering
a practical blueprint for innovation in next-generation AI systems.

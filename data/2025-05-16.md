### [1] [Next Word Suggestion using Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09649)
*Abisha Thapa Magar,Anup Shakya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图卷积网络（GNN）和LSTM的上下文嵌入方法，用于语言建模中的下一个词预测，并在资源有限的情况下验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流语言模型需要大量参数和计算资源，成本高昂。本研究旨在探索一种资源高效的上下文嵌入方法。

Method: 利用GNN的图卷积操作编码上下文，并与LSTM结合预测下一个词。实验基于自定义维基百科语料库，资源消耗低。

Result: 该方法在资源有限的情况下表现良好，能有效预测下一个词。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为资源受限的语言建模任务提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Language Modeling is a prevalent task in Natural Language Processing. The
currently existing most recent and most successful language models often tend
to build a massive model with billions of parameters, feed in a tremendous
amount of text data, and train with enormous computation resources which
require millions of dollars. In this project, we aim to address an important
sub-task in language modeling, i.e., context embedding. We propose an approach
to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and
use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context
of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a
very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well
to predict the next word.

### [2] [DRA-GRPO: Exploring Diversity-Aware Reward Adjustment for R1-Zero-Like Training of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09655)
*Xiwen Chen,Wenhui Zhu,Peijie Qiu,Xuanzhao Dong,Hao Wang,Haiyu Wu,Huayu Li,Aristeidis Sotiras,Yalin Wang,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment (DRA)的方法，通过引入语义多样性优化奖励计算，解决了GRPO在低资源设置中多样性-质量不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在低资源设置中表现良好，但其基于标量奖励信号的方法无法捕捉语义多样性，导致多样性-质量不一致。

Method: DRA利用Submodular Mutual Information (SMI)降低冗余补全的权重，增强多样性补全的奖励，从而在学习和利用高质量样本之间取得平衡。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DRA-GRPO和DGA-DR.GRPO表现优于现有基线，平均准确率达到58.2%，仅需7,000个微调样本和约55美元的训练成本。

Conclusion: DRA方法有效解决了多样性-质量不一致问题，显著提升了低资源设置下的性能，且计算成本低廉。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training,
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in
low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and
scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled
completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality
inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable
rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward
Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity
into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to
downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This
encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable
exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with
both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and
$\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only
7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/DRA-GRPO.

TL;DR: 研究发现，前沿大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 3.5）在实时对话测试中的说服能力显著优于激励人类说服者，无论是对正确答案还是错误答案的引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AI与人类在实时对话中的说服能力，验证AI是否已超越人类。

Method: 通过预注册的大规模激励实验，让参与者完成在线测试，人类或AI说服者试图引导其选择正确或错误答案。

Result: AI说服者在引导正确或错误答案时均显著优于人类，且能显著提高或降低测试者的准确性和收益。

Conclusion: AI的说服能力已超越激励人类，突显了对齐与治理框架的紧迫性。

Abstract: We directly compare the persuasion capabilities of a frontier large language
model (LLM; Claude Sonnet 3.5) against incentivized human persuaders in an
interactive, real-time conversational quiz setting. In this preregistered,
large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an
online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz
takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders
achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion
attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive
capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward
incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly
increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz
takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy,
leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers.
Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed
those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings
of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging
alignment and governance frameworks.

### [4] [System Prompt Optimization with Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09666)
*Yumin Choi,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双层系统提示优化方法，通过元学习框架优化系统提示，使其适应多样化的用户提示和未见任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注任务特定的用户提示优化，而忽略了可跨任务通用的系统提示优化。

Method: 采用元学习框架，通过迭代优化系统提示和用户提示，确保二者的协同作用。

Result: 在14个未见数据集上验证了方法的有效性，系统提示能快速适应新任务并提升性能。

Conclusion: 优化的系统提示具有通用性和快速适应性，为LLM提示优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

### [5] [VeriFact: Enhancing Long-Form Factuality Evaluation with Refined Fact Extraction and Reference Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09701)
*Xin Liu,Lechen Zhang,Sheza Munir,Yiyang Gu,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriFact是一个新框架，旨在通过识别和解决不完整或缺失的事实来提升长文本生成模型的事实性评估。FactRBench是一个新基准，同时评估精确率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估长文本生成模型的事实性时，难以捕捉关键上下文和关系事实，导致评估不准确。

Method: 提出VeriFact框架，优化事实提取和验证流程；引入FactRBench基准，支持精确率和召回率评估。

Result: VeriFact显著提升事实完整性和复杂关系保留；FactRBench显示大模型在精确率和召回率上的改进，但二者不完全相关。

Conclusion: VeriFact和FactRBench为长文本生成模型的事实性评估提供了更全面的工具，强调了精确率和召回率并重的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating long-form responses, but
evaluating their factuality remains challenging due to complex inter-sentence
dependencies within the generated facts. Prior solutions predominantly follow a
decompose-decontextualize-verify pipeline but often fail to capture essential
context and miss key relational facts. In this paper, we introduce VeriFact, a
factuality evaluation framework designed to enhance fact extraction by
identifying and resolving incomplete and missing facts to support more accurate
verification results. Moreover, we introduce FactRBench , a benchmark that
evaluates both precision and recall in long-form model responses, whereas prior
work primarily focuses on precision. FactRBench provides reference fact sets
from advanced LLMs and human-written answers, enabling recall assessment.
Empirical evaluations show that VeriFact significantly enhances fact
completeness and preserves complex facts with critical relational information,
resulting in more accurate factuality evaluation. Benchmarking various open-
and close-weight LLMs on FactRBench indicate that larger models within same
model family improve precision and recall, but high precision does not always
correlate with high recall, underscoring the importance of comprehensive
factuality assessment.

### [6] [An AI-Powered Research Assistant in the Lab: A Practical Guide for Text Analysis Through Iterative Collaboration with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09724)
*Gino Carmona-Díaz,William Jiménez-Leal,María Alejandra Grisales,Chandra Sripada,Santiago Amaya,Michael Inzlicht,Juan Pablo Bermúdez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了使用LLMs进行文本分析的高效方法，通过迭代和协作过程开发、测试和应用分类法，并以个人目标为例展示了具体步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析（如开放式回答、社交媒体帖子）耗时且易受偏见影响，LLMs提供了一种高效且质量不降的解决方案。

Method: 采用预定义（自上而下）或数据驱动（自下而上）的分类法，通过迭代和协作过程开发、测试和应用分类法。

Result: 展示了如何通过提示词生成生活领域分类法，评估和优化分类法，测试编码一致性，并以高可靠性分类整个数据集。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本分析中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，需进一步探讨其可能性与限制。

Abstract: Analyzing texts such as open-ended responses, headlines, or social media
posts is a time- and labor-intensive process highly susceptible to bias. LLMs
are promising tools for text analysis, using either a predefined (top-down) or
a data-driven (bottom-up) taxonomy, without sacrificing quality. Here we
present a step-by-step tutorial to efficiently develop, test, and apply
taxonomies for analyzing unstructured data through an iterative and
collaborative process between researchers and LLMs. Using personal goals
provided by participants as an example, we demonstrate how to write prompts to
review datasets and generate a taxonomy of life domains, evaluate and refine
the taxonomy through prompt and direct modifications, test the taxonomy and
assess intercoder agreements, and apply the taxonomy to categorize an entire
dataset with high intercoder reliability. We discuss the possibilities and
limitations of using LLMs for text analysis.

### [7] [Achieving Tokenizer Flexibility in Language Models through Heuristic Adaptation and Supertoken Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09738)
*Shaurya Sharthak,Vinayak Pahalwan,Adithya Kamath,Adarsh Shirawalmath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TokenAdapt框架，通过模型无关的tokenizer移植方法和多词Supertoken预分词学习，解决固定tokenization的低效问题，显著减少重新训练需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定tokenization方案导致多语言或专业应用中效率低下和性能受限，现有方法计算资源消耗大且难以保留语义细节。

Method: 引入TokenAdapt（结合局部子词分解和全局语义相似性的混合启发式初始化）和Supertoken预分词学习。

Result: TokenAdapt在初始化新token嵌入时优于基线方法，Supertoken实现显著压缩增益，零样本困惑度比基线方法至少提升2倍。

Conclusion: TokenAdapt框架有效解决tokenizer移植问题，显著减少重新训练需求并提升性能。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.

*J. Moreno-Casanova,J. M. Auñón,A. Mártinez-Pérez,M. E. Pérez-Martínez,M. E. Gas-López*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用NLP技术（特别是NER）自动从电子健康记录中提取肺癌和乳腺癌的关键临床信息，使用GMV的uQuery工具和bsc-bio-ehr-en3模型，取得了良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取临床报告信息耗时且易错，限制了医疗领域数据驱动方法的效率。NLP技术可以自动化这一过程，提高准确性和效率。

Method: 使用GMV的NLP工具uQuery和基于RoBERTa的bsc-bio-ehr-en3模型，通过NER技术从200份乳腺癌和400份肺癌报告中提取临床实体。

Result: 模型在识别常见实体（如MET和PAT）上表现良好，但对低频实体（如EVOL）仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NLP技术（尤其是NER）在自动化临床信息提取方面具有潜力，但需进一步优化低频实体的识别。

Abstract: Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual
extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming
and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in
healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from
electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast
cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on
public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of
cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels
at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into
standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and
classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,
including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In
this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity
Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical
information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health
Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast
cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities
manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the
bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained
in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,
enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our
results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying
entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent
entities like EVOL.

### [9] [Exploring the generalization of LLM truth directions on conversational formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09807)
*Timour Ichmoukhamedov,David Martens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs存在一个通用的真理方向，但该方向在不同对话格式中泛化能力有限，尤其是在长对话中。提出了一种通过添加固定关键词来改善泛化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs中真理方向的泛化能力，特别是在不同对话格式中的应用，以改进LLM谎言检测的可靠性。

Method: 通过线性探针分析LLMs的激活空间，测试真理方向在不同对话格式中的泛化能力，并提出在对话末尾添加固定关键词的解决方案。

Result: 在短对话中泛化良好，但在长对话中表现不佳；添加固定关键词显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM谎言检测在新场景中的泛化仍具挑战性，但通过特定方法可以部分解决。

Abstract: Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where
true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the
model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden
state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even
be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how
this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We
find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but
poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the
input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of
generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.
Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that
generalize to new settings.

### [10] [KRISTEVA: Close Reading as a Novel Task for Benchmarking Interpretive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09825)
*Peiqi Sui,Juan Diego Rodriguez,Philippe Laban,Dean Murphy,Joseph P. Dexter,Richard Jean So,Samuel Baker,Pramit Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KRISTEVA是首个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在文学细读任务中表现的多选题基准，包含1331道题目，测试LLMs在风格特征提取、上下文信息检索和多跳推理等方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLMs在文学细读任务评估上的空白，因为现有基准如MMLU未涵盖文学科目。

Method: 设计三个逐步困难的任务集（风格特征提取、上下文信息检索、多跳推理），测试LLMs的表现。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在部分任务中表现接近大学生水平（准确率49.7%-69.7%），但在11项任务中有10项仍落后于人类评估者。

Conclusion: LLMs在文学细读任务中展现出一定潜力，但仍需进一步提升以接近人类水平。

Abstract: Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level
English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts
through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details
to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for
critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university
coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models
(LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as
a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading
benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331
multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we
propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate
different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well
LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting
stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from
parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external
contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess
some college-level close reading competency (accuracy 49.7% - 69.7%), their
performances still trail those of experienced human evaluators on 10 out of our
11 tasks.

*Apollinaire Poli Nemkova,Sarath Chandra Lingareddy,Sagnik Ray Choudhury,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在预测暴力冲突方面的能力，比较了其参数化知识与非参数化能力（结合外部数据）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言任务中表现优异，但其在冲突预测中的应用尚未充分探索，这对早期预警系统和人道主义规划至关重要。

Method: 通过两部分评估框架，分别在参数化（仅依赖预训练知识）和非参数化（结合外部冲突数据集和新闻）设置下测试LLMs的预测能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在冲突预测中具有潜力，但结合外部结构化知识能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于冲突预测，但需结合外部信息以弥补预训练知识的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural
language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains
underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric
knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation
and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning
systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric
knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and
unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent
news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external
information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context
otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework
spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and
fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting,
models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and
geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g.,
Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against
historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs
for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured
external knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了西班牙语在不同地区的变体差异，强调本地化语言模型的重要性，以弥合社会语言差异并提升用户信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示拉丁美洲和西班牙书面西班牙语的主要差异，强调本地化AI模型在解决社会语言不和谐中的关键作用。

Method: 通过深入的社会文化和语言背景分析，比较不同地区的西班牙语变体。

Result: 研究表明，实施至少五种西班牙语子变体可以提升用户对AI模型的信任，并支持国际化战略。

Conclusion: 本地化语言模型不仅能弥合语言差异，还能促进用户增长和文化包容性。

Abstract: Large language models are, by definition, based on language. In an effort to
underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines
primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America
and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization
therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant
gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating
sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models
would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach
informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to
more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily
user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore,
implementing at least the proposed five sub variants of Spanish addresses two
lines of action: to foment user trust and reliance on AI language models while
also demonstrating a level of cultural, historical, and sociolinguistic
awareness that reflects positively on any internationalization strategy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合logits-based和sampling-based水印方法的混合框架，通过三种策略（串行、并行、混合）优化水印的检测性、鲁棒性、文本质量和安全性。实验表明该方法优于现有基线，达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的兴起，AI生成文本的滥用问题日益严重，水印技术成为潜在解决方案。现有水印方法在鲁棒性、文本质量和安全性之间存在权衡，亟需改进。

Method: 提出了一种混合水印框架，结合logits-based和sampling-based方法，利用三种策略（串行、并行、混合）自适应嵌入水印，并通过token熵和语义熵优化平衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集和模型上优于现有基线，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为多样化的水印范式提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the
misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution.
Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based
and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among
robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate
logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths
to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic
watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The
hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic
entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text
quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through
comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel

TL;DR: MePO是一种轻量级、可本地部署的提示优化器，通过模型无关的提示质量指标提升提示和响应质量，避免了在线优化的依赖，适用于不同规模的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖大型LLM生成提示，但可能导致轻量级模型响应质量下降，因此需要一种更通用且高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出MePO，基于模型无关的提示质量指标，使用轻量级LLM生成对齐的提示数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明MePO在多种任务和模型类型中表现优异，具有可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MePO为提示优化提供了高效、通用的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Prompt optimization (PO) offers a practical alternative to fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), enabling performance improvements without altering
model weights. Existing methods typically rely on advanced, large-scale LLMs
like GPT-4 to generate optimized prompts. However, due to limited downward
compatibility, verbose, instruction-heavy prompts from advanced LLMs can
overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality. In this
work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of interpretable design.
We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically
validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then
introduce MePO, a merit-guided, lightweight, and locally deployable prompt
optimizer trained on our preference dataset built from merit-aligned prompts
generated by a lightweight LLM. Unlike prior work, MePO avoids online
optimization reliance, reduces cost and privacy concerns, and, by learning
clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and
lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better
results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust
solution for real-world deployment. Our model and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 研究如何通过高效的超参数优化方法提升多任务自然语言模型的性能，特别是在联合实体和关系提取任务中。

Method: 采用分阶段贝叶斯优化，结合多保真度、超参数空间剪枝和渐进减半技术，使用Optuna TPE采样器和Hyperband剪枝器，以及Scikit-Learn高斯过程最小化。

Result: 在Eberts和Ulges提出的2021年联合实体和关系提取模型变体上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 分阶段超参数优化结合元学习器调优阈值的方法在多任务自然语言模型中表现高效且有效。

Abstract: This case study applies a phased hyperparameter optimization process to
compare multitask natural language model variants that utilize multiphase
learning rate scheduling and optimizer parameter grouping. We employ short,
Bayesian optimization sessions that leverage multi-fidelity, hyperparameter
space pruning, progressive halving, and a degree of human guidance. We utilize
the Optuna TPE sampler and Hyperband pruner, as well as the Scikit-Learn
Gaussian process minimization. Initially, we use efficient low-fidelity sprints
to prune the hyperparameter space. Subsequent sprints progressively increase
their model fidelity and employ hyperband pruning for efficiency. A second
aspect of our approach is using a meta-learner to tune threshold values to
resolve classification probabilities during inference. We demonstrate our
method on a collection of variants of the 2021 Joint Entity and Relation
Extraction model proposed by Eberts and Ulges.

*Deeksha Prahlad,Chanhee Lee,Dongha Kim,Hokeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KGs）的检索增强生成（RAG）方法，以解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成个性化响应时出现的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成响应时容易因过拟合而产生错误或多余信息（幻觉），主要原因是缺乏及时、事实性和个性化的输入数据。

Method: 通过结合知识图谱（KGs）和检索增强生成（RAG），为LLMs提供结构化且持续更新的个性化数据（如日历数据），以生成更准确的响应。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在理解个性化信息和生成准确响应方面显著优于基线LLMs，且响应时间略有减少。

Conclusion: 结合KGs的RAG方法能有效提升LLMs在个性化响应生成中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications,
including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and
other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs
often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra
and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of
the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and
personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response
generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing
continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can
be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,
contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our
experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in
understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared
to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate
reduction in response time.

*Lake Yin,Fan Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DIF（Demographic Implicit Fairness）的基准方法，用于量化大型语言模型（LLMs）中的隐性偏见，并发现回答准确性与隐性偏见呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于对LLMs中潜在偏见的担忧，尤其是隐性偏见对模型技术能力的负面影响，目前缺乏标准化的评估方法。

Method: 通过评估现有LLM逻辑和数学问题数据集，结合社会人口统计角色，开发了DIF基准方法。

Result: 该方法能统计验证LLM行为中的隐性偏见，并发现回答准确性与隐性偏见呈负相关。

Conclusion: 隐性偏见不仅是伦理问题，也是技术问题，DIF方法为评估LLM偏见提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen in prominence over the past few
years, there has been concern over the potential biases in LLMs inherited from
the training data. Previous studies have examined how LLMs exhibit implicit
bias, such as when response generation changes when different social contexts
are introduced. We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but
also a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate
extraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence,
there are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To
bridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable
benchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM
logic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas. We demonstrate
that this method can statistically validate the presence of implicit bias in
LLM behavior and find an inverse trend between question answering accuracy and
implicit bias, supporting our argument.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAFE是一种两阶段粗到细的方法，旨在提升多文档问答能力，通过逐步消除背景和干扰文档的负面影响，使回答更依赖证据文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文输入时仍面临检索和推理的挑战，现有方法在平衡检索精度和召回率方面存在不足。

Method: CAFE采用两阶段方法：粗粒度过滤识别和排序相关文档，细粒度引导关注最相关内容。

Result: 实验显示CAFE在基准测试中优于基线方法，在Mistral模型上分别比SFT和RAG方法提升22.1%和13.7%的SubEM。

Conclusion: CAFE通过两阶段方法有效提升了多文档问答能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their input
context length, yet they still struggle with retrieval and reasoning in
long-context inputs. Existing methods propose to utilize the prompt strategy
and retrieval head to alleviate this limitation. However, they still face
challenges in balancing retrieval precision and recall, impacting their
efficacy in answering questions. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{CAFE}$,
a two-stage coarse-to-fine method to enhance multi-document question-answering
capacities. By gradually eliminating the negative impacts of background and
distracting documents, CAFE makes the responses more reliant on the evidence
documents. Initially, a coarse-grained filtering method leverages retrieval
heads to identify and rank relevant documents. Then, a fine-grained steering
method guides attention to the most relevant content. Experiments across
benchmarks show CAFE outperforms baselines, achieving up to 22.1% and 13.7%
SubEM improvement over SFT and RAG methods on the Mistral model, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）因训练数据中的问题内容而容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，揭示了一种通用越狱攻击方法，并指出行业在AI安全方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多个领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是越狱攻击可能导致模型输出有害内容，亟需研究解决。

Method: 研究通过分析LLMs的训练数据漏洞，设计了一种通用越狱攻击方法，测试了多个先进模型的脆弱性。

Result: 研究发现许多LLMs仍对七个月前公开的攻击方法脆弱，且行业对安全问题的响应不足。

Conclusion: 随着LLMs的普及和开源化，其滥用风险增加，需采取果断措施以防止危险知识的传播。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields
from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable
capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to
jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems
from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes
unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their
intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by
dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified
through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal
jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models,
enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon
request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months
ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack.
Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers
were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices
regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and
as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates.
Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to
dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了预训练语言模型（PLMs）对非洲语言的语言学知识编码情况，发现针对非洲语言优化的PLMs比多语言PLMs表现更好，并揭示了语言学信息在模型各层的分布规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言的PLMs性能提升原因不明，需通过系统研究揭示其语言学知识编码机制。

Method: 训练分层探针分析六种非洲语言的语言学特征分布，设计控制任务验证探针性能。

Result: 优化的PLMs编码更多目标语言信息；句法信息集中在中后层，语义信息分布更广；控制任务证实性能反映模型内部知识。

Conclusion: 研究为非洲语言PLMs的成功策略（如主动学习和多语言适应）提供了内部机制解释。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) for African languages are continually
improving, but the reasons behind these advances remain unclear. This paper
presents the first systematic investigation into probing PLMs for linguistic
knowledge about African languages. We train layer-wise probes for six
typologically diverse African languages to analyse how linguistic features are
distributed. We also design control tasks, a way to interpret probe
performance, for the MasakhaPOS dataset. We find PLMs adapted for African
languages to encode more linguistic information about target languages than
massively multilingual PLMs. Our results reaffirm previous findings that
token-level syntactic information concentrates in middle-to-last layers, while
sentence-level semantic information is distributed across all layers. Through
control tasks and probing baselines, we confirm that performance reflects the
internal knowledge of PLMs rather than probe memorisation. Our study applies
established interpretability techniques to African-language PLMs. In doing so,
we highlight the internal mechanisms underlying the success of strategies like
active learning and multilingual adaptation.

TL;DR: XRAG是一个新的基准测试，用于评估LLM在跨语言检索增强生成（RAG）中的生成能力，特别是在用户语言与检索结果不匹配的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在跨语言RAG中的表现，尤其是在复杂推理和语言正确性方面的挑战。

Method: 通过从新闻文章中构建XRAG数据集，涵盖单语和多语检索场景，并提供相关性标注。

Result: 实验发现LLM在单语检索中语言正确性表现不佳，而在多语检索中跨语言推理是主要挑战。

Conclusion: XRAG是一个有价值的基准，揭示了LLM在跨语言RAG中的未报告挑战。

Abstract: We propose XRAG, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the generation
abilities of LLMs in cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
settings where the user language does not match the retrieval results. XRAG is
constructed from recent news articles to ensure that its questions require
external knowledge to be answered. It covers the real-world scenarios of
monolingual and multilingual retrieval, and provides relevancy annotations for
each retrieved document. Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in
questions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap
between human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable
benchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the
additional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover
two previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the
monolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response
language correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main
challenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather
than generation of non-English text.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在医学问答中的表现，验证知识注入假设在医学领域的适用性。

Method: 使用S-MedQA数据集进行实验，分析不同专科数据训练对模型性能的影响，并观察临床相关术语的概率变化。

Result: 1）专科数据训练未必带来最佳表现；2）临床相关术语概率普遍提升，改进主要源于领域转移。

Conclusion: 建议重新思考医学领域微调数据的作用，改进更多来自领域转移而非知识注入。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering
(QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models in fine-grained clinical
specialties. We use S-MedQA to check the applicability of a popular hypothesis
related to knowledge injection in the knowledge-intense scenario of medical QA,
and show that: 1) training on data from a speciality does not necessarily lead
to best performance on that specialty and 2) regardless of the specialty
fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms for all
specialties increase consistently. Thus, we believe improvement gains come
mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than knowledge
injection and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical
domain. We release S-MedQA and all code needed to reproduce all our experiments
to the research community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在决策辅助中常因幻觉响应和不可靠输出引发信任问题。

Method: 结合知识图谱、检索增强生成、CoT逻辑生成、n-hop子图搜索和基于蕴含的句子生成。

Result: 方法提升了现有模型在自由上下文中准确检索证据的能力，增强了LLM结论的可信度。

Conclusion: GE-Chat为LLM输出提供了可靠的证据支持，有助于判断其可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models are now key assistants in human decision-making
processes. However, a common note always seems to follow: "LLMs can make
mistakes. Be careful with important info." This points to the reality that not
all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually.
The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly
plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among
users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph
enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based
response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a
knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented
agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its
training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation,
n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize
accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the
existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a
free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's
conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过合成数据训练的Reasoning CPT方法，显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，并在多领域表现出性能提升和迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调和强化学习方法在训练推理模型时局限于特定领域，而CPT方法缺乏对推理数据合成及其影响的深入研究。

Method: 提出Reasoning CPT方法，利用合成数据重建文本背后的隐藏思维过程，并在Gemma2-9B模型上应用，对比标准CPT。

Result: Reasoning CPT在所有评估领域均提升性能，推理能力可跨领域迁移，且在难题上表现更优，最高提升8分。

Conclusion: Reasoning CPT通过调整推理深度适应问题难度，为多领域推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are
primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,
which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of
training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of
not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively
synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of
domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden
thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the
result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT
to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and
Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis
reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all
evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer
effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as
problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most
challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to
adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

Motivation: 理解长链思维（CoT）的推理策略对有效使用大型语言模型至关重要，但现有方法受限于人类直觉，无法全面捕捉模型行为。

Conclusion: 训练数据格式对推理行为的影响大于数据领域，强调了格式感知模型设计的重要性。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of
modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies
underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have
attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches
are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of
model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up
framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically
extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into
a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives
contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show
that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than
existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables
performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and
guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical
insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs.
multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data
domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

TL;DR: VQ-Logits利用向量量化技术显著减少大语言模型输出层的参数和计算成本，仅带来轻微的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的输出层因词汇量大导致参数和计算成本高，现有方法结构复杂。

Method: 提出VQ-Logits，用小型共享码本替代大型输出嵌入矩阵，通过预测码本上的logits并映射到完整词汇空间。

Result: 实验显示，VQ-Logits减少99%输出层参数，提速6倍，仅增加4%困惑度。

Conclusion: VQ-Logits是一种高效且稳健的解决方案，适用于大语言模型的输出层优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face
significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their
extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping
hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial
portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference.
Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce
structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach
that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter
count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the
large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K
embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of
these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,
which are then efficiently "scattered" to the full vocabulary space using the
learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits
can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in
logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to
full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on
codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the
robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决角色扮演对话代理（RPCAs）在角色一致性上的挑战。

Method: 提出RAIDEN-R1框架，结合VRAR奖励机制，采用单术语和多术语挖掘策略生成量化奖励，并构建高质量角色感知数据集。

Result: 14B-GRPO模型在Script-Based Knowledge和Conversation Memory指标上分别达到88.04%和88.65%的准确率，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RAIDEN-R1填补了RPCA训练中的量化空白，推动了角色感知推理模式的发展。

Abstract: Role-playing conversational agents (RPCAs) face persistent challenges in
maintaining role consistency. To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness
Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining
strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset
through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning
coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's
superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on
Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively,
outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses
further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual
cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the
non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware
reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)
systems, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential
for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual
understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the
capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3,
Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex
textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian.
Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying
references to human rights violations within the dataset.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared
against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000
samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different
prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian.
Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and
disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths,
limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.
  By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes
to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive,
domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how
language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a
critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Quicker是一个基于大型语言模型的临床决策支持系统，旨在自动化证据合成并生成临床建议，显著提升决策效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床证据整合到实时实践中存在挑战，如工作量大、流程复杂和时间限制，需要自动化工具支持高效准确的决策。

Method: Quicker通过自动化链条覆盖从问题到临床建议的所有阶段，并支持定制化决策。使用Q2CRBench-3基准数据集评估其性能。

Result: Quicker表现出色，包括问题分解、文献检索和筛选性能接近专家水平，建议更全面且逻辑连贯，协作时间缩短至20-40分钟。

Conclusion: Quicker有助于医生更快、更可靠地做出基于证据的临床决策。

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides
healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed
decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is
challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and
time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence
synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical
settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision
support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate
evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard
clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated
chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and
further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and
interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed
the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development
records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted
Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored
to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and
literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of
relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively
supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more
comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level
testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time
required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our
findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and
more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

TL;DR: J1是一种通过强化学习训练LLM-as-a-Judge模型的方法，优于现有8B和70B模型，并在某些基准测试中超越更大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI评估质量的瓶颈促使开发更强大的LLM-as-a-Judge模型，尤其是通过改进链式思维推理能力。

Method: J1将可验证和不可验证的提示转化为带有可验证奖励的判断任务，激励思考并减少偏见。

Result: J1在8B和70B规模下优于其他模型，甚至在某些情况下超越更大型模型。

Conclusion: J1通过优化训练方法、奖励策略和思维长度，显著提升了模型的判断能力。

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful
LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment
ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need
to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we
introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our
method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks
with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.
In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models
when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1
also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a
smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs
Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,
seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our
models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria,
comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the
correctness of model responses.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低维、密集且可解释的文本嵌入方法LDIR，通过相对表示实现语义相关性和可解释性，性能接近黑盒基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入方法（如SimCSE和LLM2Vec）性能优秀但难以解释，而经典稀疏嵌入（如词袋模型）性能较差。需要一种兼具高性能和可解释性的低维嵌入方法。

Method: 提出LDIR方法，通过最远点采样生成低维密集嵌入，数值表示与不同锚文本的语义相关性。

Result: 在多个语义文本相似性、检索和聚类任务中，LDIR性能接近黑盒基线模型，优于其他可解释嵌入基线且维度更少。

Conclusion: LDIR是一种低维、密集且可解释的文本嵌入方法，兼具高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural
language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have
demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are
difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable
embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024)
propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms
"0/1" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These
interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than
10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and
Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The
numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different
anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic
representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability.
We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and
clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close
to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings
baselines with much fewer dimensions. Code is available at

Abstract: Decoding thoughts from brain activity offers valuable insights into human
cognition and enables promising applications in brain-computer interaction.
While prior studies have explored language reconstruction from fMRI data, they
are typically limited to single-modality inputs such as images or audio. In
contrast, human thought is inherently multimodal. To bridge this gap, we
propose a unified and flexible framework for reconstructing coherent language
from brain recordings elicited by diverse input modalities-visual, auditory,
and textual. Our approach leverages visual-language models (VLMs), using
modality-specific experts to jointly interpret information across modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art systems while remaining adaptable and extensible. This work
advances toward more ecologically valid and generalizable mind decoding.

Abstract: This paper explores the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis system

simultaneously. We demonstrate that a combined multi-domain model achieves
performance comparable to specialized single-domain models while reducing
operational complexity. We also share lessons learned for handling
non-extractive predictions and evaluating various failure modes when developing
LLM-based systems for structured prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语法的解码方法RPG，用于解决代码生成中的结构重复问题，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型提升了代码生成性能，但结构重复问题仍然存在，现有研究多关注内容重复，忽视了更普遍的结构重复。

Method: RPG利用语法规则识别重复问题，并通过衰减关键令牌的似然来减少重复。

Result: RPG在CodeRepetEval、HumanEval和MBPP基准测试中显著优于基线方法，有效减少重复并提升生成代码质量。

Conclusion: RPG通过语法规则有效缓解代码生成中的结构重复问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation
has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the
best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and
MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of
generated code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLM）生成的简明语言摘要（PLS）在主观评价中与人工编写的难以区分，但人工编写的PLS在理解效果上显著更优。自动化评估指标与人类判断不一致，需改进评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的PLS在健康信息理解中的有效性不明确问题，填补现有评估方法的不足。

Method: 通过大规模众包评估（150名参与者），结合主观评分（简单性、信息量、连贯性、忠实性）和客观理解测试（多选题），并对比10种自动化指标与人类判断。

Result: LLM生成的PLS在主观评价中表现类似人工，但人工编写的PLS理解效果更好；自动化指标与人类判断不一致。

Conclusion: 需开发更注重理解效果的评估框架和生成方法，自动化指标不适用于PLS评估。

Abstract: Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective
communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical
information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but
their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains
unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do
not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from
convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we
conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through
subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,
coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and
recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the
alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear
indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,
human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,
automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into
question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to
systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and
comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation
frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods
that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.

Motivation: 现实中的RAG应用常面临长上下文输入问题，冗余信息和噪声导致高推理成本和性能下降。

Method: LongRefiner采用双级查询分析、分层文档结构和基于多任务学习的自适应优化，使用单一基础模型。

Result: 在七个QA数据集上的实验表明，LongRefiner性能优异，计算成本和延迟比最佳基线低10倍。

Conclusion: LongRefiner高效、可扩展且实用，为长文本RAG应用提供了实际解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world RAG applications often encounter long-context input scenarios,
where redundant information and noise results in higher inference costs and
reduced performance. To address these challenges, we propose LongRefiner, an
efficient plug-and-play refiner that leverages the inherent structural
characteristics of long documents. LongRefiner employs dual-level query
analysis, hierarchical document structuring, and adaptive refinement through
multi-task learning on a single foundation model. Experiments on seven QA
datasets demonstrate that LongRefiner achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while using 10x fewer computational costs and latency
compared to the best baseline. Further analysis validates that LongRefiner is
scalable, efficient, and effective, providing practical insights for real-world
long-text RAG applications. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DCoLT是一种用于扩散语言模型的推理框架，通过逆向扩散过程中的中间步骤作为潜在“思考”动作，利用基于结果的强化学习优化推理轨迹，显著提升了模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法采用线性因果推理，限制了推理的灵活性。DCoLT旨在通过双向、非线性的推理方式，突破这一限制。

Method: DCoLT在两种扩散语言模型（SEDD和LLaDA）上实现，分别通过概率策略和基于排名的Unmasking Policy Module优化推理步骤。

Result: 实验显示，DCoLT显著提升了模型在数学和代码生成任务中的表现，LLaDA在多个数据集上的推理准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: DCoLT为扩散语言模型提供了一种高效的推理优化方法，显著优于传统训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a
reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each
intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking"
action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on
the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal,
linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with
no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of
thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete
diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to
maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion
steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model --
LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential
role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking
Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both
math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800
GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even
both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%,
+5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.

Result: 在四个开放域QA数据集上性能提升2%-4%。

Conclusion: CL-RAG框架有效提升RAG系统性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method to enhance the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on
optimizing the retriever or generator in the RAG system by directly utilizing
the top-k retrieved documents. However, the documents effectiveness are various
significantly across user queries, i.e. some documents provide valuable
knowledge while others totally lack critical information. It hinders the
retriever and generator's adaptation during training. Inspired by human
cognitive learning, curriculum learning trains models using samples progressing
from easy to difficult, thus enhancing their generalization ability, and we
integrate this effective paradigm to the training of the RAG system. In this
paper, we propose a multi-stage Curriculum Learning based RAG system training
framework, named CL-RAG. We first construct training data with multiple
difficulty levels for the retriever and generator separately through sample
evolution. Then, we train the model in stages based on the curriculum learning
approach, thereby optimizing the overall performance and generalization of the
RAG system more effectively. Our CL-RAG framework demonstrates consistent
effectiveness across four open-domain QA datasets, achieving performance gains
of 2% to 4% over multiple advanced methods.

Motivation: 当前代码安全基准仅关注单一任务和范式（如代码补全和生成），缺乏对安全代码生成、漏洞修复和识别等多维度的全面评估。

Method: 提出CoV-Eval多任务基准，覆盖代码补全、漏洞修复、漏洞检测和分类等任务；开发VC-Judge模型，更高效可靠地审查LLM生成的程序漏洞。

Result: 评估了20种LLM，发现多数LLM能较好识别漏洞代码，但在生成安全代码和修复特定漏洞类型上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 实验揭示了LLM代码安全的关键挑战和优化方向，为未来研究提供了见解。

Abstract: Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant
applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security
benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code
completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions
like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this
paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks
such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and
classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we
developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human
experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more
efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable
codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with
recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive
experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization
directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.

Motivation: 在跨语言迁移的标记分类任务中，标签投影是一个关键但具有挑战性的步骤。尽管词对齐器（WAs）和标记方法被广泛使用，但其低层设计决策的影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 系统研究了词对齐器在标签投影中的低层设计决策（如标签投影算法、过滤策略和预标记化），并提出了一种集成翻译-训练和翻译-测试预测的新策略。

Result: 优化后的词对齐器性能与标记方法相当，而新提出的集成策略显著优于标记方法，并降低了对低层设计决策的敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过优化词对齐器的设计和引入集成策略，可以提升跨语言迁移任务的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Translation-based strategies for cross-lingual transfer XLT such as
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- and translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language
data translated from the target language -- are competitive XLT baselines. In
XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label
projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the
original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word
aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design
decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been
systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which
project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)
translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,
we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects
of low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for
projecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to
reduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of
the translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact
translation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT
with WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.
We then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and
translate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms
the marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling
also reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more
robust XLT for token classification tasks.

Conclusion: MuToR是一种简单有效的多令牌预测方法，具有广泛适用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving
language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized
to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a
simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves
learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting
future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key
advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters,
requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf
pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining
objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning.
Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases,
including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and
pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision
domains. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/nasosger/MuToR.

Motivation: 受语言模型中测试损失与模型和数据规模呈幂律关系的启发，探索偏好建模中是否存在类似规律，并提出WorldPM方法。

Method: 收集公共论坛的偏好数据，使用1.5B至72B参数的模型进行大规模训练，分析不同评估指标的表现。

Result: 发现对抗性指标随数据量和模型规模提升，客观指标在大模型中表现突出，主观指标无缩放趋势；WorldPM在多个基准测试中性能提升显著。

Conclusion: WorldPM作为偏好微调的基础方法具有广泛潜力，能显著提升泛化性能，并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss
scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws
exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM)
to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified
representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data
from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive
training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B
parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics:
(1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently
scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective
metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior
in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3)
Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or
AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the
effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly
improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of
varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5%
on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we
observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets,

*Zhiyuan Hu,Yibo Wang,Hanze Dong,Yuhui Xu,Amrita Saha,Caiming Xiong,Bryan Hooi,Junnan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过明确对齐模型的三种元能力（演绎、归纳和溯因）来提升大型推理模型（LRMs）的可扩展性和可靠性的方法，取代了依赖提示和偶然的“顿悟时刻”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型虽然具备长链推理能力，但其涌现的推理行为（如自我修正、回溯和验证）的时机和一致性不可预测，限制了模型的可靠性和扩展性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：个体对齐、参数空间合并和领域特定的强化学习，通过自动生成的自验证任务明确对齐模型的元能力。

Result: 方法在指令调优基线的基础上提升了10%以上的性能，领域特定的强化学习进一步在数学、编程和科学基准上平均提升了2%。

Conclusion: 明确的元能力对齐为推理提供了可扩展且可靠的基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long
chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning
behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena
often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and
consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and
uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning
capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts
and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three
meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically
generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual
alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning,
boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines.
Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an
additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and
science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a
scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning. Code is available at:

*Agnik Saha,Victoria Churchill,Anny D. Rodriguez,Ugur Kursuncu,Muhammed Y. Idris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了通用和医疗大语言模型（LLMs）在生成准确、安全且易于理解的癌症信息方面的能力与局限，发现通用模型在语言质量和情感表达上更优，而医疗模型在信息可及性上表现更好，但存在更高的潜在危害和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌和宫颈癌的公共认知存在显著差距，可能导致诊断延误和治疗不足，研究旨在评估LLMs在支持患者理解方面的潜力。

Method: 采用混合方法评估框架，结合定量指标、定性专家评分及Welch's ANOVA、Games-Howell和Hedges' g统计方法，比较五款通用和三款医疗LLMs的表现。

Result: 通用LLMs在语言质量和情感表达上更优，医疗LLMs在信息可及性上表现更好，但潜在危害、毒性和偏见更高，影响其安全性和可信度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了领域专业知识与安全性之间的权衡，强调需针对性改进模型设计以减少危害和偏见，提升安全性和情感表达，为未来AI生成健康内容提供关键见解。

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对游戏搜索算法性能通用性的研究，尤其是在双人零和完美信息游戏中。

Method: 提出了一种新的搜索算法，并在22种游戏中进行实验，比较其在不同搜索时间下的性能。

Result: 在短搜索时间内，新算法在所有游戏中表现最佳；在中等搜索时间内，在17种游戏中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 新算法在双人零和完美信息游戏中具有优越性，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Games, in their mathematical sense, are everywhere (game industries,
economics, defense, education, chemistry, biology, ...).Search algorithms in
games are artificial intelligence methods for playing such games.
Unfortunately, there is no study on these algorithms that evaluates the
generality of their performance. We propose to address this gap in the case of
two-player zero-sum games with perfect information. Furthermore, we propose a
new search algorithm and we show that, for a short search time, it outperforms
all studied algorithms on all games in this large experiment and that, for a
medium search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on 17 of the 22
studied games.

Motivation: 现有方法在识别分类模型中的关键特征时存在效率问题，尤其是在复杂模型（如神经网络）中。本文旨在改进这些方法并引入新概念。

Method: 基于命题逻辑和充分理由概念，改进现有算法以高效检测必要特征，并引入全局“有用性”概念及其检测算法。

Result: 在决策树和复杂模型中开发了高效算法，并通过三个数据集验证了其实际效用。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法和概念显著提升了特征重要性分析的效率和实用性，为模型解释提供了新工具。

Abstract: Given a classification model and a prediction for some input, there are
heuristic strategies for ranking features according to their importance in
regard to the prediction. One common approach to this task is rooted in
propositional logic and the notion of \textit{sufficient reason}. Through this
concept, the categories of relevant and necessary features were proposed in
order to identify the crucial aspects of the input. This paper improves the
existing techniques and algorithms for deciding which are the relevant and/or
necessary features, showing in particular that necessity can be detected
efficiently in complex models such as neural networks. We also generalize the
notion of relevancy and study associated problems. Moreover, we present a new
global notion (i.e. that intends to explain whether a feature is important for
the behavior of the model in general, not depending on a particular input) of
\textit{usefulness} and prove that it is related to relevancy and necessity.
Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting it in decision trees
and other more complex models, and experiment on three datasets to analyze its
practical utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，目标识别（GR）面临目标多变且数量众多的挑战，传统方法难以适应。

Method: 采用无模型目标条件强化学习（RL）方法，实现快速适应多变任务的目标识别。

Result: 该方法能够有效应对动态环境中的目标识别问题，提升实时GR系统的性能。

Conclusion: 论文为动态目标识别提供了新的研究方向，并展示了无模型目标条件RL在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in
human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent
collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant
challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly
evolving. Traditional GR methods, designed for a predefined set of goals, often
struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed
at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area.
Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned
RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.

TL;DR: XpertXAI是一种基于专家驱动的可解释AI模型，用于多肺病理检测，其解释性优于现有方法，并与专家判断更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在肺病理检测中决策不透明的问题，推动临床可解释AI的应用。

Method: 扩展ClinicXAI，采用InceptionV3分类器和公共数据集，与现有解释方法及XCBs进行比较。

Result: XpertXAI在预测准确性和解释性上优于基线方法，更符合专家判断。

Conclusion: XpertXAI展示了可扩展的人类中心化模型设计在医学诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from
chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque
model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric,
expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung
cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a
generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical
concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a
high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest
X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc
explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations
through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground
truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert
validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently
fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic
features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only
outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers
concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our
focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates
how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader
diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful
explainable AI in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce diagnostic
reports from medical images, with the potential to enhance clinical workflows
and reduce radiologists' workload. While recent approaches leveraging
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have achieved strong results, they continue to face challenges such as
factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose
a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise
clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft
generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic
metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and
interpretable reports. This work highlights the potential of clinically aligned
multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI
applications.

Motivation: 在微电网电压调节中，由于技术或安全问题，无法进行在线环境交互，因此需要一种离线学习方法。

Method: 使用离线强化学习算法，在预先收集的数据集上进行训练，无需在线交互。

Result: 在IEEE 33总线系统上的实验表明，该方法在不同离线数据集（包括低质量数据）上均有效。

Abstract: This paper presents a study on using different offline reinforcement learning
algorithms for microgrid voltage regulation with solar power penetration. When
environment interaction is unviable due to technical or safety reasons, the
proposed approach can still obtain an applicable model through offline-style

Result: 框架能够评估结构良好和有问题的提问，并适应不同上下文。

Conclusion: 研究为问题评估提供了灵活全面的框架，将提问行为与结构化分析方法结合。

Abstract: Questioning has become increasingly crucial for both humans and artificial
intelligence, yet there remains limited research comprehensively assessing
question quality. In response, this study defines good questions and presents a
systematic evaluation framework. We propose two key evaluation dimensions:
appropriateness (sociolinguistic competence in context) and effectiveness
(strategic competence in goal achievement). Based on these foundational
dimensions, a rubric-based scoring system was developed. By incorporating
dynamic contextual variables, our evaluation framework achieves structure and
flexibility through semi-adaptive criteria. The methodology was validated using
the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the ability of the framework to
access both well-formed and problematic questions while adapting to varied
contexts. As we establish a flexible and comprehensive framework for question
evaluation, this study takes a significant step toward integrating questioning
behavior with structured analytical methods grounded in the intrinsic nature of
questioning.

Abstract: The trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of relentless
acceleration, evolving from rudimentary rule-based systems to sophisticated,
autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction. This whitepaper
chronicles this remarkable journey, charting the key technological
milestones--advancements in prompting, training methodologies, hardware
capabilities, and architectural innovations--that have converged to create the
AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like
OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in
AI development, potentially constituting the "final generation" of intelligence
as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying
technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also
examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of
progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six
months. The paper concludes by underscoring the critical need for wisdom and
foresight in navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this
powerful new era of intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在代理系统中的性能，尤其是解决小模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出Pre-Act方法，生成多步执行计划并逐步优化，适用于对话和非对话代理；对小模型（如Llama 3.1）进行微调。

Conclusion: Pre-Act方法显著提升代理性能，尤其在小模型上通过微调实现突破，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has
become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as
DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through
the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise
before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act,
a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step
execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This
plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining
itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our
approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To
measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a
two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our
turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach,
Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While
this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for
practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often
struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address
this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B &
70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the
fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action
accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate
(end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

Motivation: 现有抑郁检测数据集和方法主要关注年轻人，忽略了其他年龄段和个体差异对抑郁表现的影响。

Method: MPDD挑战分为两个子任务：Track 1使用MPDD-Elderly数据集检测老年人抑郁，Track 2使用MPDD-Young数据集检测年轻人抑郁。基线模型融合了音频、视频模态和个体差异信息。

Result: MPDD挑战旨在推动更个性化和准确的抑郁检测方法的发展。

Conclusion: 该挑战有望促进心理健康研究的进步，并推动更具包容性的抑郁检测系统的开发。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups,
with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However,
existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults,
neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence
depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping
between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the
complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge
includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the
MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses
the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The
Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to
address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual
difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video
modalities with individual difference information to detect depression
manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the
development of more personalized and accurate de pression detection methods,
advancing mental health research and fostering inclusive detection systems.

Motivation: MOOC中缺乏师生直接互动，学习者难以理解新知识概念；现有LLM存在幻觉问题，RAG系统在多课程应用中受限且缺乏主动引导。

Method: 提出Graph RAG管道，结合EduKG和PKG，实现个性化问题生成（PKG-based）和基于知识关系的问答（EduKG-based）。

Result: 在CourseMapper平台上对3门MOOC课程的专家评估显示，Graph RAG能有效帮助学习者理解新知识概念。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为MOOC学习者提供了个性化的学习体验，展示了其在知识理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners
and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge
concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to
hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a
response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by
unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not
actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these
challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational
Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide
learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to
recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an
EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between
knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To
evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3
different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the
evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand
new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.

Abstract: Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

Abstract: As the field of healthcare increasingly adopts artificial intelligence, it
becomes important to understand which types of explanations increase
transparency and empower users to develop confidence and trust in the
predictions made by machine learning (ML) systems. In shared decision-making
scenarios where doctors cooperate with ML systems to reach an appropriate
decision, establishing mutual trust is crucial. In this paper, we explore
different approaches to generating explanations in eXplainable AI (XAI) and
make their underlying arguments explicit so that they can be evaluated by
medical experts. In particular, we present the findings of a user study
conducted with physicians to investigate their perceptions of various types of
AI-generated explanations in the context of diagnostic decision support. The
study aims to identify the most effective and useful explanations that enhance
the diagnostic process. In the study, medical doctors filled out a survey to
assess different types of explanations. Further, an interview was carried out
post-survey to gain qualitative insights on the requirements of explanations
incorporated in diagnostic decision support. Overall, the insights gained from
this study contribute to understanding the types of explanations that are most
effective.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in
simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to
pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their
applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent
Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and
continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for
large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and
optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization
process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its
superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting
experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments,
parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in
comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock
pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with
similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法假设人类常识是统一的，但实证显示人类常识存在巨大差异，因此需要一种更准确的评估框架。

Method: 通过比较模型判断与人类群体的共识，评估LLMs的常识能力，并分析不同模型的表现。

Result: LLMs在个体常识能力上低于人类中位数，且与人类群体的相关性有限；小型开源模型表现优于大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁AI模型需适应不同文化背景的人类群体，以更好地反映常识的多样性。

Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks
that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An
important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately
capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as
homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary
enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident
to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel
method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),
specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically
observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a
model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when
treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human
median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as
simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only
modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In
both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than
larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties
commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call
for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often
incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.

Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working
conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However,
the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare
scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades,
with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).
SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last
decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to
outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.
  In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a
wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints
are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective
state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired
rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for
certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the
problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs
better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set
of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted
during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the
generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and
experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based
methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of
personnel scheduling.

Motivation: 研究代理如何受其观察影响，以及这种影响与赋权的关系，以更全面地理解代理行为。

Method: 通过定义一个新的信息论量‘广义定向信息’来量化可塑性，并分析其与赋权的对称关系。

Result: 发现可塑性是赋权的镜像，两者之间存在张力，代理设计需平衡二者。

Conclusion: 可塑性和赋权及其关系对理解代理行为至关重要。

Abstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations
and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by
empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial
intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally
foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by
what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal
agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental
connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable
definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we
call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity
strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while
preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that
plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to
the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding
establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,
suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We
explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,
empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.

Conclusion: AXE为解释评估提供了一种独立且有效的框架，适用于未来研究。

Abstract: There can be many competing and contradictory explanations for a single model
prediction, making it difficult to select which one to use. Current explanation
evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal "ground-truth"
explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs. We outline
the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to
ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local
feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation
Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that
satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require
access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model
sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality. We
verify AXE by comparing with baselines, and show how it can be used to detect
explanation fairwashing. Our code is available at

Abstract: This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI,
offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge
analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We
begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions,
characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation.
Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through
tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast,
Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent
collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated
autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution,
operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a
comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as
customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with
Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and
medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm
including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination
failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration
layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for
developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为自学习和推理代理在动态环境中的潜力，评估其自适应能力。

Method: 通过自反思、启发式变异和规划等提示技术，在动态环境中测试不同开源语言模型的性能。

Result: 大模型通常优于小模型，但战略提示可缩小差距；高级提示技术对小模型更有效，但推理方法效果不稳定；模型在关键领域仍有限制。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在规划和推理等方面存在根本性不足，需超越静态基准以全面评估推理能力。

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ANN-to-SNN转换方法在处理大语言模型时存在激活异常和非线性操作不兼容的问题，限制了其能效优势。

Method: LAS引入两种新型神经元，用于转换ANN模型的激活异常和非线性操作，并定制了脉冲等效的Transformer组件。

Result: 在六种语言模型和两种视觉语言模型上，LAS实现了无损转换，并在OPT-66B模型上提升了2%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAS通过创新的神经元设计和组件定制，成功实现了无损的ANN-SNN转换，验证了其有效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient
alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To
effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN
conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting
the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle
with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of
ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for
fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel
neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based
LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for
spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of
performance. Experimental results on six language models and two
vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion.
Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In
addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness
of LAS. The source code is available at https://github.com/lc783/LAS

Conclusion: 本文填补了高容量LLMs与高效模拟硬件之间的鸿沟，为能效优化的基础模型提供了路径。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve
speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of
conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces
fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on
input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions,
off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when
deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated
recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic
method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet
exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly
adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach
enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including
Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain
performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the
presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show
that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can
be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show
that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better
scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input
quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient
analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

Motivation: 图遗忘在保护用户隐私方面至关重要，但现有方法在删除用户信息时可能导致预测分布变化并引入偏见，因此研究公平性在图遗忘中的作用尤为重要。

Result: 实验表明FGU在保持隐私和准确性的同时实现了优越的公平性，且对不同遗忘请求具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FGU解决了图遗忘中的偏见问题，为隐私保护和公平性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph unlearning is a crucial approach for protecting user privacy by erasing
the influence of user data on trained graph models. Recent developments in
graph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction
performance while removing user information. However, we have observed that
when user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution
across different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are
shown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph
unlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph
unlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions
of post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes,
confirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address
this issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee
privacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the
requested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models
on the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing
process: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness
regularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level
fairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our
experiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining
privacy and accuracy. Additionally, FGU is robust to diverse unlearning
requests, ensuring fairness and utility performance across various data
distributions.

Conclusion: 该研究为优化AIoT场景中联邦学习的能源效率提供了有效方法，同时解决了设备异构性带来的挑战。

Abstract: While substantial research has been devoted to optimizing model performance,
convergence rates, and communication efficiency, the energy implications of
federated learning (FL) within Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
scenarios are often overlooked in the existing literature. This study examines
the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main
energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning,
all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation
that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of
model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two
clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group
AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed
of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity
often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout
extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering
strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low
energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the
literature.

Conclusion: 首次在约束下成功训练DMNNs，但泛化能力有限；混合架构为优化训练提供新方向。

Abstract: We investigate deep morphological neural networks (DMNNs). We demonstrate
that despite their inherent non-linearity, activations between layers are
essential for DMNNs. We then propose several new architectures for DMNNs, each
with a different constraint on their parameters. For the first (resp. second)
architecture, we work under the constraint that the majority of parameters
(resp. learnable parameters) should be part of morphological operations. We
empirically show that our proposed networks can be successfully trained, and
are more prunable than linear networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to successfully train DMNNs under such constraints, although the
generalization capabilities of our networks remain limited. Finally, we propose
a hybrid network architecture combining linear and morphological layers,
showing empirically that the inclusion of morphological layers significantly
accelerates the convergence of gradient descent with large batches.

Result: 常见神经网络在OOD任务中表现不佳，新架构虽在OOD性能上接近完美，但仍可能未学习正确的组合特征。

Conclusion: 仅OOD性能测试不足以证明算法学习了组合结构，需进一步验证特征的组合性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human
and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must
discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output
mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an
intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable
input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act
based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the
task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to
confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data,
it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm
that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by
exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable
by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop
two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be
successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost
perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct
features for compositional generalisation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for collaborative
model training while maintaining data privacy across decentralized client
datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes,
and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This
study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses
data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The
proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise
cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and
robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant
improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under
varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed
framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial
performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices
while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this
method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a
robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习能量景观结构，有效提升黑盒优化的样本效率和求解质量。

Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial
optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP
problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the
black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model
the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the
network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high
temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low
temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and
facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the
temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and
improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard,
the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the
black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under
both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance
against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community
structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed
interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and
abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple
overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value
functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized
membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this
structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and
value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring
access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both
transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation,
and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function
approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the
first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and
active learning with provable guarantees.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to
distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data
for successive training of future model generations creates "self-consuming
loops", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,
synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on
their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is
curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop
drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those
preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or
adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit
malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this
paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining
loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the
impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions
for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we
design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a
platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's
model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLM时，检查点数据量大且传输耗时，需优化以减少数据量和时间开销。

Method: 分析检查点数据的可压缩性，结合字节分组和增量增量压缩技术，开发了基于字节分组和霍夫曼编码的LMC压缩方案。

Result: LMC压缩性能优于BZ2，压缩和解压吞吐量分别达2.78 GiB/s和3.76 GiB/s，显著减少CPU资源占用。

Conclusion: LMC通过高效压缩支持更高频率的检查点，优化了LLM训练过程。

Abstract: During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is
periodically "checkpointed" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work
done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during
each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as
bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be
moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch
occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution,
this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a
design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of
data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model
training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general
purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques
such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.
  Leveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution,
known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and
Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best
alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed
to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of
LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76
GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU
resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system
before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.

Abstract: Stroke remains one of the most critical global health challenges, ranking as
the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability
worldwide. This study explores the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms
in predicting stroke risk using demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data from
the Stroke Prediction Dataset. By addressing key methodological challenges such

the development of more reliable and interpretable models for the early
assessment of stroke risk.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them
systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full
potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search
for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to
optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's
vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be
inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections
to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully
utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an
intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the
Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always
stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique
and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several
widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using
five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that
the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to
three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques. The source code for our
implementation is available at:

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in
classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying
uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence
algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has
introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous
datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory
into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more
effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a
zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy
and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of
multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture
to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse
datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and
energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization
capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives.
As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy
landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material
behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the
temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for
data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as
a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems
involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more
capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling
technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and
decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many
scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization
imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While
more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for
homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper
introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the
challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,
characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and
lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and
asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet
decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We
introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically
infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model
updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's
model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized
training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous
decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network
size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource
requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods
outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and
heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and
reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.

Conclusion: 环境可预测性是Transformer模型学习模式选择的关键因素，研究为理解ICL和优化训练方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),
encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting
flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding
to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for
explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a
critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering
novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.

Conclusion: BINGO为AI发展提供了一种不依赖模型规模增长的可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased
exponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to
gargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that
large models have become the state of the art means that it often costs
millions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt
companies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new
developments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods
used to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great
accuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly
computationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is
introduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a
neural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight
plays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,
BINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for
insignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an
accuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive
than current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to
mean model growth, as well.

Conclusion: KQT-EWMA是一种高效且实用的非参数化变化检测算法，适用于多元数据流监测。

Abstract: We present Kernel-QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (KQT-EWMA),
a non-parametric change-detection algorithm that combines the Kernel-QuantTree
(KQT) histogram and the EWMA statistic to monitor multivariate data streams
online. The resulting monitoring scheme is very flexible, since histograms can
be used to model any stationary distribution, and practical, since the
distribution of test statistics does not depend on the distribution of
datastream in stationary conditions (non-parametric monitoring). KQT-EWMA
enables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run
Length ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to
be monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in
contrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can
control the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving
detection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed
to work in the same conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类行为和自动化决策方面具有潜力，但在复杂环境中的适应性仍需改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate
human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question
is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and
can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the
exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic
decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB)
tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct
a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms.
We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents
and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and
reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning
shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random
and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs
exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans.
However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match
human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite
achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the
promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for
automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.

Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities:
text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these
breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of
adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit
vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat
amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or
across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types
remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners
adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications,
it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive
actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial
attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This
survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how
multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the
multimodal world.

Abstract: With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price
forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value
crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as
seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle
with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid
deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer
Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for
dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass
avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as
sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected
from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic
preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization,
the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate
that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance,
with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods.
This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series
forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for
intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.

Result: 数值实验表明，这两种方法在复杂几何流形上的分布采样中表现优异。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了流形约束数据采样中的奇异性问题，显著提高了生成样本的准确性。

Abstract: Euclidean diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative
modeling across diverse domains, and they have been extended to manifold case
in recent advances. Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special
manifolds as studied in previous works, we investigate direct sampling of the
Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-constrained data in this paper.
We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the embedded
space of manifold, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples.
We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure
of the score function by separating it along the tangential and normal
directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the
sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which introduces
non-isotropic noise along the normal direction to reduce scale discrepancies,
and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score
function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over
various manifolds with complex geometries.

Conclusion: Online-iForest在需要快速检测异常的应用（如网络安全、欺诈和故障检测）中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种交互式持续学习范式RiCL，通过实时人类反馈动态学习新技能并保留旧知识，解决了传统持续学习中的静态数据和噪声标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习依赖静态数据集和干净标签，而实际应用中数据是动态且标签可能噪声较大。RiCL旨在通过实时交互和噪声处理解决这些问题。

Method: RiCL框架包括三个关键组件：时间一致性感知净化器、交互感知直接偏好优化策略和抗噪声对比学习模块。

Result: 在FewRel和TACRED数据集上的实验表明，RiCL显著优于现有的在线持续学习和噪声标签学习方法。

Conclusion: RiCL通过动态反馈和噪声处理，有效提升了持续学习的性能，适用于现实世界中的交互场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI
models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while
retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major
limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using
streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with
fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling
the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,
we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from
dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal
consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in
data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to
align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and
human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that
captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus
avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise
patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing
combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习模型难以捕捉事故中复杂因素间的交互作用，LLM为全面分析事故原因提供了新思路。

Method: 通过QLoRA微调Llama3 8B模型，利用226项高速公路事故研究数据训练，进行零样本分类识别事故原因。

Result: 模型有效识别了酒驾、超速等主要事故原因，并通过问卷验证了88.89%的研究者认可其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: LLM能全面分析事故原因，为交通规划者和政策制定者提供有价值的见解和潜在对策。

Abstract: Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing
strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical
methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex
interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each
crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway
crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226
traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset
encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was
created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its
understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in
these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash
causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing
comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable
and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively
identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,
aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as
road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical
applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated
by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,
as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the
complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive
analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it
provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and
policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety
practices.

Motivation: 研究长期持续学习（CL）中灾难性遗忘问题，探索现有方法在长期CL中的表现，并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出Long-CL框架，包括任务核心记忆管理策略和长期记忆巩固机制，并构建多模态和文本基准（MMLongCL-Bench和TextLongCL-Bench）。

Result: Long-CL在两个基准上分别比现有最优方法提高了7.4%和6.5%的平均精度（AP）。

Conclusion: Long-CL通过模拟人类记忆机制，有效解决了长期CL中的灾难性遗忘问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a
model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new
knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to
human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling
a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of
catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1)
How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How
can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged
sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework
inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL).
Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to
efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning
progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism
that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust
knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and
release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and
TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL
approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by 7.4\% and 6.5\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: TransPL是一种新的无监督域自适应方法，通过建模源域的联合分布并使用代码转移矩阵解决时间序列数据中的伪标签生成问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪标签策略未能捕捉时间序列数据的时序模式和通道间变化，导致伪标签质量不佳。

Method: TransPL通过向量量化时间序列片段生成代码转移矩阵，利用贝叶斯规则进行目标域自适应，生成基于通道加权类条件似然的伪标签。

Result: 在四个时间序列UDA基准测试中，TransPL显著优于现有方法（准确率提升6.1%，F1分数提升4.9%）。

Conclusion: TransPL不仅提升了性能，还通过代码转移矩阵提供了可解释的域自适应过程。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical
challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing
to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing
sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that
addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X},
y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are
derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method
constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source
domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating
pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods.
TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions
and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards
different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable
pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive
analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1%
accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable
insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition
matrices.

Conclusion: FedRAG在保护隐私的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) methods usually share the encrypted
local state or policy information and help each client to learn from others
while preserving everyone's privacy. In this work, we propose that sharing the
approximated behavior metric-based state projection function is a promising way
to enhance the performance of FRL and concurrently provides an effective
protection of sensitive information. We introduce FedRAG, a FRL framework to
learn a computationally practical projection function of states for each client
and aggregating the parameters of projection functions at a central server. The
FedRAG approach shares no sensitive task-specific information, yet provides
information gain for each client. We conduct extensive experiments on the
DeepMind Control Suite to demonstrate insightful results.

enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种将问题转化为DR折扣马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），另一种通过引入锚定状态来稳定控制转移核。

Result: 在假设名义MDP均匀遍历的情况下，两种算法在KL和f_k-散度不确定性集下，均达到了样本复杂度为Õ(|S||A|t_mix²ε⁻²)的收敛保证。

Conclusion: 论文首次为DR平均奖励强化学习提供了有限样本收敛保证，并通过数值实验验证了算法的收敛速率。

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is
critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the
problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning.
We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The
first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP),
while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state
to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set.
Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms
attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|
t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as
well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based
uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here,
$\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote
the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing
time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence
guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the
convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.

Result: 现有离线强化学习算法在未见任务上表现不佳（35.44%成功率），而真实数据训练的方法表现更好（64.37%）。

Conclusion: 需要改进算法以更好地利用LLM虚拟数据，并提出了未来研究方向，如快速在线适应和多模态任务扩展。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on
extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While
recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this
limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for
mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the
lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that
leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of
ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and
LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering
locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural
language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate
language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of
state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying
existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks,
achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method
training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for
algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally,
we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization
of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and
extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算机在生物医学数据分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum-classical Hybrid Machine Learning (QHML) models are recognized for
their robust performance and high generalization ability even for relatively
small datasets. These qualities offer unique advantages for anti-cancer drug
response prediction, where the number of available samples is typically small.
However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding
used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with
suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we
propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a
moderated gradient version of the $\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs
of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges.
Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response
measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction
performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These
results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when
data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for
biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了电路发现的效果，还揭示了逻辑门在语言模型功能中的基本特性。

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for
mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also
garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not
guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across
different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of
incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which
are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To
this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and
ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical
gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements
necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a
framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which
can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without
significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of
fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit.
In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability
to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this
framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as
their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave
among the functionalities of language models.

Conclusion: IPAL通过结合图结构信息和原型对比学习，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，为持续图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) endure catastrophic forgetting, undermining their
capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge amid the assimilation of
novel information. Rehearsal-based techniques revisit historical examples,
adopted as a principal strategy to alleviate this phenomenon. However, memory
explosion and privacy infringements impose significant constraints on their
utility. Non-Exemplar methods circumvent the prior issues through Prototype
Replay (PR), yet feature drift presents new challenges. In this paper, our
empirical findings reveal that Prototype Contrastive Learning (PCL) exhibits
less pronounced drift than conventional PR. Drawing upon PCL, we propose
Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL), a novel paradigm for Non-Exemplar
Continual Graph Learning (NECGL). Exploiting graph structural information, we
formulate Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP), guiding feature
distributions towards high-impact nodes to augment the model's capacity for
assimilating new knowledge. Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD)
safeguards task memory by regularizing discontinuities in class relationships.
Moreover, we embed a Decision Boundary Perception (DBP) mechanism within PCL,
fostering greater inter-class discriminability. Evaluations on four node
classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a better trade-off between
plasticity and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在追求预测准确性的同时牺牲了透明度和可解释性，导致难以满足监管要求和获得利益相关者信任。

Method: 采用堆叠集成梯度提升模型，并结合SHAP、LIME、PDP和PFI等XAI技术增强模型解释性。

Result: 在IEEE-CIS欺诈检测数据集上，模型准确率达99%，AUC-ROC为0.99，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高预测准确性与透明可解释性可以结合，为金融欺诈检测提供更可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models often prioritize predictive accuracy,
often at the expense of model transparency and interpretability. The lack of
transparency makes it difficult for organizations to comply with regulatory
requirements and gain stakeholders trust. In this research, we propose a fraud
detection framework that combines a stacking ensemble of well-known gradient
boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are used to enhance the transparency
and interpretability of the model's decisions. We used SHAP (SHapley Additive
Explanations) for feature selection to identify the most important features.
Further efforts were made to explain the model's predictions using Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), Partial Dependence Plots
(PDP), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
dataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to
evaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an
accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent
related approaches. These results indicate that combining high prediction
accuracy with transparent interpretability is possible and could lead to a more
ethical and trustworthy solution in financial fraud detection.

Conclusion: 自适应蒸馏方法和知识轨迹设计有效提升了联合建模的性能，为多任务学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Depth estimation and scene segmentation are two important tasks in
intelligent transportation systems. A joint modeling of these two tasks will
reduce the requirement for both the storage and training efforts. This work
explores how the multi-task distillation could be used to improve such unified
modeling. While existing solutions transfer multiple teachers' knowledge in a
static way, we propose a self-adaptive distillation method that can dynamically
adjust the knowledge amount from each teacher according to the student's
current learning ability. Furthermore, as multiple teachers exist, the
student's gradient update direction in the distillation is more prone to be
erroneous where knowledge forgetting may occur. To avoid this, we propose a
knowledge trajectory to record the most essential information that a model has
learnt in the past, based on which a trajectory-based distillation loss is
designed to guide the student to follow the learning curve similarly in a
cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarking datasets
including Cityscapes and NYU-v2. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions,
our method achieves a clearly improvement. The code is provided in the
supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解耦框架ChronoSteer，结合LLM和TSFM的多模态模型，通过文本修订指令指导时间序列预测，解决了事件-序列配对数据稀缺问题，并在合成数据上训练后显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测方法仅依赖单模态时间序列数据，无法充分利用丰富的文本信息。结合LLM的文本推理能力和TSFM的时间建模能力，构建多模态模型成为关键挑战。

Method: 提出解耦框架：LLM将文本事件转化为修订指令，指导TSFM输出。引入ChronoSteer模型，并设计基于合成数据的两阶段训练策略。

Result: ChronoSteer在合成数据上训练后，预测精度比单模态基线提升25.7%，比现有最佳多模态方法提升22.5%。

Conclusion: ChronoSteer有效结合LLM和TSFM，通过文本指令指导时间序列预测，解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了多模态预测性能。

Abstract: Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting
their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated
powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively.
Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that
concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future
inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity
of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is
employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then
used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce
ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision
instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the
shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage
training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a
high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the
information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM,
ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7%
improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a
22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MiCo的分层语言代理框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）设计启发式方法，解决云服务中的在线动态多维装箱问题（ODMBP）。通过两阶段架构（Option Miner和Option Composer），MiCo在复杂和大规模场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以适应实时变化，启发式方法策略僵化，现有学习方法缺乏通用性和可解释性。MiCo旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将ODMBP建模为半马尔可夫决策过程（SMDP-Option），通过Option Miner和Option Composer两阶段架构，利用LLM设计动态调度策略。

Result: 在涉及10,000多个虚拟机的真实企业数据集上，MiCo实现了96.9%的竞争比，并在非平稳请求流和多样化配置下保持高性能。

Conclusion: MiCo在复杂和大规模云环境中表现出高效性和适应性，验证了其作为解决ODMBP问题的有效方法。

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online
Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by
large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization
methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed
heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based
methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named
MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design
paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling
through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.
Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware
strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer
employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the
non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on
real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\%
competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual
machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows
and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and
large-scale cloud environments.

Abstract: Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural
network frameworks remains an open challenge in machine learning. Recent
advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient
molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive
pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior
probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy
that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse
multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived
from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic
tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and
significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction
tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms
the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task
augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in
multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection
or pretraining.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了本地模型的适应性，并优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化本地模型的适应性，可以有效提升联邦学习中全局模型的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables the clients to collaboratively train a global
model, which is aggregated from local models. Due to the heterogeneous data
distributions over clients and data privacy in federated learning, it is
difficult to train local models to achieve a well-performed global model. In
this paper, we introduce the adaptability of local models, i.e., the average
performance of local models on data distributions over clients, and enhance the
performance of the global model by improving the adaptability of local models.
Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the
adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide
the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the
data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local
training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train
the local model. Extensive experiments on federated learning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adaptability of local
models and achieves a well-performed global model that consistently outperforms
the baseline methods.

Conclusion: FedAPC能有效应对领域异构性，提升联邦学习的全局模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training while ensuring data
privacy across distributed edge devices, making it a popular solution for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL faces significant challenges due to
statistical heterogeneity, particularly domain heterogeneity, which impedes the
global mode's convergence. In this study, we introduce a new framework to
address this challenge by improving the generalization ability of the FL global
model under domain heterogeneity, using prototype augmentation. Specifically,
we introduce FedAPC (Federated Augmented Prototype Contrastive Learning), a
prototype-based FL framework designed to enhance feature diversity and model
robustness. FedAPC leverages prototypes derived from the mean features of
augmented data to capture richer representations. By aligning local features
with global prototypes, we enable the model to learn meaningful semantic
features while reducing overfitting to any specific domain. Experimental
results on the Office-10 and Digits datasets illustrate that our framework
outperforms SOTA baselines, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: 所提算法在多智能体多臂老虎机问题中高效且准确，特别适用于M远小于N的场景。

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of best arm identification for multi-agent
multi-armed bandits. We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where
each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and
bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the
goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\delta$-probably
correct ($\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and
communication overhead.
  We propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification
(Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a
two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they
are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl
reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering
agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination
framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.
  We establish $\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their
sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover,
when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant
of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic
and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency,
particularly in settings where $M \ll N$.

Conclusion: QuXAI框架显著提升了HQML模型的可解释性和可靠性，推动了量子增强AI技术的安全应用。

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models
opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental
complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency
and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in
its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local
explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ
quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus
of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an
explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model
entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use
of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum
transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result
shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as
well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI
techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more
significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY.
The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route
to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting
greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use
of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，Alinear以不到1%的参数优于大规模模型，并在不同预测范围内保持高精度。

Conclusion: 挑战‘模型越大越好’的观念，提倡更高效的时间序列建模范式。

Abstract: Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series
forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent
architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have
often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is
this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law
in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight
forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level
parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that
dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths,
alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable
prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational
overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models
while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy
across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly
evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric
that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our
analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components
varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern,
validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the
prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a
paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.

Conclusion: 合成数据可作为真实数据的替代方案，用于开发鲁棒的机器学习模型。

Abstract: In the photolithographic process vital to semiconductor manufacturing,
various types of defects appear during EUV pattering. Due to ever-shrinking
pattern size, these defects are extremely small and cause false or missed
detection during inspection. Specifically, the lack of defect-annotated quality
data with good representation of smaller defects has prohibited deployment of
deep learning based defect detection models in fabrication lines. To resolve
the problem of data unavailability, we artificially generate scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of line patterns with known distribution of defects and
autonomously annotate them. We then employ state-of-the-art object detection
models to investigate defect detection performance as a function of defect
size, much smaller than the pitch width. We find that the real-time object
detector YOLOv8 has the best mean average precision of 96% as compared to
EfficientNet, 83%, and SSD, 77%, with the ability to detect smaller defects. We
report the smallest defect size that can be detected reliably. When tested on
real SEM data, the YOLOv8 model correctly detected 84.6% of Bridge defects and
78.3% of Break defects across all relevant instances. These promising results
suggest that synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real-world data in
order to develop robust machine-learning models.

Result: 在语言建模、文本生成等任务中表现优异，生成困惑度更低，长上下文一致性更好。

Conclusion: ComplexFormer提供了一种更灵活、高效的注意力机制，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but
face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while
allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model
semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional
adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This
paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA.
CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional
differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as
rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a
per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections
into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation;
and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism,
exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct
strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative
positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language
modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show
ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation
perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines
like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency,
offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.

Abstract: Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management
and the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle. The ability to
automatically recognise animals' feeding activities through the identification
of specific jaw movements allows for the improvement of diet formulation, as
well as early detection of metabolic problems and symptoms of animal
discomfort, among other benefits. The use of sensors to obtain signals for such
monitoring has become popular in the last two decades. The most frequently
employed sensors include accelerometers, microphones, and cameras, each with
its own set of advantages and drawbacks. An unexplored aspect is the
simultaneous use of multiple sensors with the aim of combining signals in order
to enhance the precision of the estimations. In this direction, this work
introduces a deep neural network based on the fusion of acoustic and inertial
signals, composed of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers. The main
advantage of this model is the combination of signals through the automatic
extraction of features independently from each of them. The model has emerged
from an exploration and comparison of different neural network architectures
proposed in this work, which carry out information fusion at different levels.
Feature-level fusion has outperformed data and decision-level fusion by at
least a 0.14 based on the F1-score metric. Moreover, a comparison with
state-of-the-art machine learning methods is presented, including traditional
and deep learning approaches. The proposed model yielded an F1-score value of
0.802, representing a 14% increase compared to previous methods. Finally,
results from an ablation study and post-training quantization evaluation are
also reported.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a
growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities
beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain
knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in
time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as
energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses
LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting
accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series
dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary
information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly
outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and
generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer
strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting
tasks.

*Yizhou liu,Ziming Liu,Jeff Gore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）性能随模型规模增大的原因，提出表示叠加是神经缩放定律的关键机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经缩放定律的起源，即为何损失随模型规模呈幂律下降。

Method: 基于两个经验原则构建玩具模型，分析损失与模型规模的关系，并在开源LLM中验证。

Result: 发现弱叠加时损失与特征频率相关，强叠加时损失与模型维度成反比，且开源LLM符合强叠加预测。

Conclusion: 表示叠加是神经缩放定律的核心机制，未来可优化训练策略和架构以提升效率。

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the
observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate
that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model
architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上，现有系统因GPU内存不足而将模型权重卸载到CPU内存，导致GPU核心利用率低和I/O开销大。

Method: 提出SpecOffload，利用GPU资源存储和执行推测解码的草稿模型，并通过规划器优化张量放置和参数选择。

Result: 相比最佳基线，SpecOffload将GPU核心利用率提升4.49倍，推理吞吐量提高2.54倍。

Conclusion: SpecOffload通过优化资源利用，显著提升了LLM推理效率，且成本几乎为零。

Abstract: Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant
challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory,
existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O
overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1)
GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be
loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its
capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose
SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative
decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for
storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus
accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we
carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in
speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to
manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best
baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts
inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的并行计算扩展方法（ParScale），通过并行化输入转换和动态聚合输出，显著提升了推理效率，同时减少了内存和延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型扩展方法（参数扩展或推理时扩展）通常需要较高的空间或时间成本，作者希望通过并行计算提升效率。

Method: 引入并行扩展（ParScale），对输入应用多种可学习的并行转换，动态聚合输出，适用于任何模型结构或任务。

Result: 实验表明，ParScale在相同性能提升下，内存和延迟开销显著低于参数扩展，且可通过少量后训练复用预训练模型。

Conclusion: ParScale为低资源场景下的模型部署提供了新思路，并重新定义了计算在机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\log P)$ while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\times$
less memory increase and 6$\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于深度强化学习（DRL）的电动公交车（EB）充电调度问题，提出了一种分层DRL（HDRL）方法，通过将原始马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）分解为高层半MDP（SMDP）和多个低层MDP，解决了长程多阶段规划和稀疏奖励的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动公交车的充电调度问题复杂且具有长程多阶段规划的特点，传统方法难以有效解决，因此需要一种新的分层强化学习方法。

Method: 提出了分层双深度Q网络（HDDQN）-后见经验回放（HER）算法，将决策问题分解为高层和低层策略，分别学习充电目标和充电功率的优化策略。

Result: 实验证明，叠加最优高层和低层策略的平面策略性能与原始MDP的最优策略相当。

Conclusion: 通过分层学习和HER算法的结合，有效解决了充电调度问题，降低了充电成本。

Abstract: The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Result: 在真实用户查询测试中，函数分类准确率和API参数选择均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于合成数据的微调模型优于传统方法，为函数调用任务设定了新基准。

Abstract: This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function
calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital
content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural
language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world
task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate
synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation
fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data
distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We
present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like
content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and
vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training
data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data
generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a
fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive
set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function
classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our
synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new
benchmarks for function calling tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的联邦学习数据重建攻击方法，克服了现有攻击的局限性，能够完美恢复任意大规模的数据批次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）虽然保护了数据隐私，但存在恶意服务器通过操纵模型更新重建客户端私有数据的漏洞。现有攻击方法受限于数据分布假设或小批量数据效率。

Method: 利用全连接层的新几何视角设计恶意模型参数，无需客户端数据先验知识，即可在分类任务中完美恢复大规模数据批次。

Result: 在图像和表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能完美恢复比现有技术大两个数量级的数据批次。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了数据重建攻击的能力，揭示了联邦学习在隐私保护方面的潜在风险。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning
models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly
preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical
vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate
model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data
reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on
assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency
significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.
  In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes
these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully
connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect
recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any
prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image
and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing
methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of
magnitude larger than the state of the art.

TL;DR: MASSV通过两阶段方法将小型语言模型转化为高效的多模态草稿模型，显著加速了视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小型语言模型无法处理视觉输入且预测与视觉语言模型不匹配，限制了推测解码技术的应用。

Method: MASSV分两阶段：1) 通过轻量级投影器连接目标模型的视觉编码器；2) 使用目标模型生成的自蒸馏视觉指令调整对齐预测。

Result: 实验显示，MASSV在视觉任务中接受长度增加30%，推理速度提升1.46倍。

Conclusion: MASSV为加速当前和未来的视觉语言模型提供了一种可扩展且兼容架构的方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by
enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger
target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to
vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small
language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural
components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match
those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce
Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of
Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models
into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first
connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight
trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning
using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.
Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families
demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers
end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV
provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both
current and future VLMs.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解基于脉冲时序的Hebbian学习提供了理论支持，并揭示了其与优化方法的深层联系。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural
networks. It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the
activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on
neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules
that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect
to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows
us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron
with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy
mirror descent.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step
toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems,
charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on
real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical
challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and
fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities,
charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales
and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the
original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these
MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL
algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic
(DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at
both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor
network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state
information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low
level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is
incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated
charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing
convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the
superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet
charging schedules.

Result: 实验表明FeRA能有效降低后门攻击成功率，同时保持主任务的高准确率。

Conclusion: FeRA是一种模型无关、攻击无关且无需标记数据的防御方法，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for
resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at
the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse,
non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the
detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA,
that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to
distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based
on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose
internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our
evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios,
including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices.
Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success
rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is
model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data,
making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.

Conclusion: NML-GCL有效解决了假阴性问题，提升了GCL性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which
degrades the performance on downstream tasks. The existing methods addressing
the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading
GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric
Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative
Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives
can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to
anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we
propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which
implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the
encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the
extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data
without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical
deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds
and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model
of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under
practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To
understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic
Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges
under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is
established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments
reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time
across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and
communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is
well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.

statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the
superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods

Result: 研究表明，这两种能力能够帮助RL代理在部署时高效适应新环境变化。

Conclusion: 高效在线适应需要优先探索和选择性知识保留的结合。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous decision-making systems, from robots to recommendation
engines, must operate in environments that change over time. While deep
reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal
policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume
a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,
conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a
fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when
encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without
catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation
demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:
(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and
learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior
knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without
disruption to reusable components.

emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition
from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we
introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective
behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is
weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss
as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the
distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss
(or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by
a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher
perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal
temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by
construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random
classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.
Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in
high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to
shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散潜在空间在许多数据模态（如文本）中可能更自然，因此需要系统地介绍离散VAEs的理论与实践。

Result: 提供了一个离散VAEs的教程和实现示例，代码托管在GitHub上。

Conclusion: 离散VAEs是一种有潜力的方法，适用于特定数据模态，本文为学习和实践提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well-established as a principled approach
to probabilistic unsupervised learning with neural networks. Typically, an
encoder network defines the parameters of a Gaussian distributed latent space
from which we can sample and pass realizations to a decoder network. This model
is trained to reconstruct its inputs and is optimized through the evidence
lower bound. In recent years, discrete latent spaces have grown in popularity,
suggesting that they may be a natural choice for many data modalities (e.g.
text). In this tutorial, we provide a rigorous, yet practical, introduction to
discrete variational autoencoders -- specifically, VAEs in which the latent
space is made up of latent variables that follow a categorical distribution. We
assume only a basic mathematical background with which we carefully derive each
step from first principles. From there, we develop a concrete training recipe
and provide an example implementation, hosted at

Result: SMTOs表现良好，但固定权重方法在某些情况下也能取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SMTOs和均匀权重方法在不同场景下各有优劣，代码将公开。

Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task
Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient
norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques
suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to
SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor
hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we
evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs,
including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to
clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared
to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance
compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform
similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: There are now a multitude of AI-scribing solutions for healthcare promising
the utilization of large language models for ambient documentation. However,
these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating
notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This
risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the
intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to
catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is
compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for
extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare
consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate
the final note. The FactsR method results in more accurate and concise notes by
placing the clinician-in-the-loop of note generation, while opening up new use
cases within real-time decision support.

Conclusion: SCGP是一种高效且可扩展的GNN增强方法，适用于实时和资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over
graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by
over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into
fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and
bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid
this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley
graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical
properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory
usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation
(SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features
through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology.
SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space,
improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational
efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification
benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or
exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits
particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures,
offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory
footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained
applications.

Conclusion: AneuG通过两阶段VAE方法解决了IA形状生成的挑战，为临床研究和血流模拟提供了实用工具。

Abstract: A generative model for the mesh geometry of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is
crucial for training networks to predict blood flow forces in real time, which
is a key factor affecting disease progression. This need is necessitated by the
absence of a large IA image datasets. Existing shape generation methods
struggle to capture realistic IA features and ignore the relationship between
IA pouches and parent vessels, limiting physiological realism and their
generation cannot be controlled to have specific morphological measurements. We
propose AneuG, a two-stage Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based IA mesh
generator. In the first stage, AneuG generates low-dimensional Graph Harmonic
Deformation (GHD) tokens to encode and reconstruct aneurysm pouch shapes,
constrained to morphing energy statistics truths. GHD enables more accurate
shape encoding than alternatives. In the second stage, AneuG generates parent
vessels conditioned on GHD tokens, by generating vascular centreline and
propagating the cross-section. AneuG's IA shape generation can further be
conditioned to have specific clinically relevant morphological measurements.
This is useful for studies to understand shape variations represented by
clinical measurements, and for flow simulation studies to understand effects of
specific clinical shape parameters on fluid dynamics. Source code and
implementation details are available at

Result: 多机制分解显著提升数据效率，接近人类学习水平，且其影响大于符号与亚符号学习的区别。

Conclusion: 整合多机制学习可能是缩小机器学习与人类学习效率差距的关键。

Abstract: Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms
working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural
networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective
function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid
learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven
deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of
learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation
analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring
environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient
3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning
into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency,
bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this
decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between
symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine
learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning
efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning
mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.

Result: 发现参数模型通过bSGD学习时，目标函数可用多项式大小的随机特征组合近似，且组合大小取决于梯度步数和数值精度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了无分布学习在梯度下降训练神经网络中的局限性，强调了数据分布假设的必要性，并提出了新的理论框架adc。

Abstract: We study the relationship between gradient-based optimization of parametric
models (e.g., neural networks) and optimization of linear combinations of
random features. Our main result shows that if a parametric model can be
learned using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (bSGD) without making
assumptions about the data distribution, then with high probability, the target
function can also be approximated using a polynomial-sized combination of
random features. The size of this combination depends on the number of gradient
steps and numerical precision used in the bSGD process. This finding reveals
fundamental limitations of distribution-free learning in neural networks
trained by gradient descent, highlighting why making assumptions about data
distributions is often crucial in practice. Along the way, we also introduce a
new theoretical framework called average probabilistic dimension complexity
(adc), which extends the probabilistic dimension complexity developed by Kamath
et al. (2020). We prove that adc has a polynomial relationship with statistical
query dimension, and use this relationship to demonstrate an infinite
separation between adc and standard dimension complexity.

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，L2T显著降低了计算复杂度，并在多种推理任务中提升了效果和效率。

Conclusion: L2T通过强化学习优化模型，实现了更高效的推理和资源利用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in
reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between
reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging
unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we
propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement
fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning
with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as
a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense
process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in
parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We
propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and
the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly
reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately
rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T
optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each
episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning
benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different
tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate.
Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather
prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required.
Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation,
but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this
paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero
to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and
intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for
the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting
geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of
diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual
correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our
results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing
clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.
These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the
past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows
the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a
conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion
models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion
models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin
on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box
ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the
ensemble correlating well to the error.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems.
Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires
performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has
to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of
conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally
linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing
identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine
operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using
the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous
part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman
eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using
metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based
eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against
an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear
feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the
eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled
proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control
approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the
optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results
showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark
controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under
sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

techniques, and confirm that PI-Forest is better at measuring arbitrary

Conclusion: SEAL展示了结合NAS和选择性扩展在增量学习中的潜力，实现了高效、自适应的学习。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from
a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing
plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge).
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of
the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static
settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often
rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in
resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based
framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint
data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL
adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary,
based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through
cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component
jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy.
Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively
reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size
compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS
and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental
scenarios.

Conclusion: NCDPO为扩散策略的强化学习微调提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as
robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills
from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the
sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion
policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.
While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising
solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to
effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This
challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood
estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated
optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized
policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much
lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies
(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework
that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.
By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned
on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and
gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments
demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when
training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency
and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot
control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results
show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the
Diffusion Policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习方法（如VDN、QMIX）在满足个体-全局最大值（IGM）属性时表示能力有限，而QPLEX虽无此限制但过于复杂。因此，需要一种简单且能完全表示IGM值的方法。

Method: 提出QFIX模型，通过一个简单的‘修复’层扩展现有模型的表示能力，并推导出多个变体，在两种多智能体框架中实现。

Result: 在SMACv2和Overcooked环境中，QFIX提升了现有方法的性能，比QPLEX更稳定且表现更好，同时使用最简单和最小的混合模型。

Conclusion: QFIX是一种简单且高效的价值函数分解方法，能够完全表示IGM值，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent
utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action
selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains
consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the
individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is
straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited
representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM
values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is
unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the
full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a
novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the
representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer.
We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two
well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on
multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i)
succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably
and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this
while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.

transparency by attributing model outputs to input features. However, these
methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network
architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from
several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model
architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a
restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for
layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal
recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization
phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology
in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the
optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data
modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI
automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation
methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations. We validate
the framework's effectiveness through user surveys and showcase its versatility
across various domains, including medicine and finance.

Abstract: Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy
challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural
or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for
capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a
biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a
pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation.
PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based
representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling
the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined
pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff
demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints
compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher
docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design,
without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore
modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and
flexible framework for rational drug design.

Motivation: 空气污染和极端天气事件加剧了健康风险，而个人传感和AI技术的进步为个性化健康监测提供了新机会。

Method: 整合可穿戴设备的生理数据和实时环境暴露数据，使用对抗自编码器神经网络进行建模，并通过迁移学习提高泛化能力。

Result: AI模型能准确重建时间依赖的健康信号，并捕捉对污染的非线性反应。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了利用个人传感数据和AI预测个性化健康反应的潜力。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or
exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate
change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and
heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of
pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the
collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for
new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside
new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor
and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel
workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by
integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time
environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure
and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual
health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework.
We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network
in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and
captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using
data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities
of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world,
user-generated data.

theoretical side, we demonstrate that key thermodynamic quantities (e.g.,
temperature, entropy, heat capacity, thermal conduction) and classical
thermodynamic principles (e.g., the three laws of thermodynamics and the
equipartition theorem) naturally emerge under river-valley loss landscape
assumptions. On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields

Abstract: Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge
risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to
disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity
of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from
multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster,
and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in
damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its
strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data
such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data
privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper
also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of
dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we
outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable,
and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We
believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI
techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response.

Motivation: 当前AI研究过于关注设计可信赖的AI系统以促进人类信任，但忽略了社会背景下AI可能被滥用的风险。合理的不信任是保护人类自主权的必要态度。

Method: 通过跨学科（计算机科学、社会学、历史学、心理学、哲学）分析信任与不信任的概念，提出“健康的不信任”框架。

Result: “健康的不信任”填补了现有信任理论的空白，为尊重人类自主权的AI使用提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 合理的不信任是构建真正信任的关键，尤其在AI可能被滥用的社会背景下，健康的不信任是保护人类利益的重要机制。

Abstract: Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is
focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust
and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI
system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they,
if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to
believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases,
distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust
in the first place. We propose the term "healthy distrust" to describe such a
justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate
prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history,
psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might
fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that
respects human autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估VLMs在机器人低层推理能力的统一基准，因此需要一种新方法来衡量其性能。

Method: 提出ManipBench基准，测试33种VLMs在物体交互和可变形物体操作等维度的表现。

Result: VLMs性能差异显著，与真实任务表现相关，但仍远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: ManipBench为评估VLMs在机器人低层推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and
robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic
manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work
has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making
decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks
a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level
reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench,
to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs
across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object
interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33
representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including
variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the
performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong
correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation
tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models
and human-level understanding. See our website at:

Motivation: 解决工业环境中多机器人执行相同测量任务时的任务分配和碰撞避免问题，提升计算效率和操作安全性。

Method: 使用K-means聚类和2-Opt算法划分任务区域并规划机器人路径，同时解决任务分配和碰撞避免问题。

Result: 实现了93%的时间减少（1.24s vs 17.62s）和7%的解决方案质量提升，完全消除了碰撞点。

Conclusion: 空间分区方法在任务分配和碰撞避免问题上表现优异，对实际工业应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined
solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance
with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial
environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve
the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the
workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task
sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use
K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows
satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against
17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best
performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates
collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant
sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning
unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance
problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse
geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial
importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and
operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练数据集与机器人操作任务之间存在显著领域差距，且缺乏有效整合3D信息的模型架构。

Method: 通过增强DROID数据集并开发多模态掩码自编码器（EmbodiedMAE），结合随机掩码和跨模态融合技术学习多模态表示。

Result: 在70个仿真任务和20个真实机器人操作任务中，EmbodiedMAE在训练效率和性能上均优于现有视觉基础模型。

Conclusion: EmbodiedMAE是一种可靠的多模态3D视觉基础模型，特别适用于需要精确空间感知的桌面操作场景。

Abstract: We present EmbodiedMAE, a unified 3D multi-modal representation for robot
manipulation. Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between
training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model
architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome
these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps
and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D
embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked
autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and
point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion.
Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final
performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation
tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with
size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental
results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for
embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings
where spatial perception is critical.

Motivation: 传统避障方法在重复使用的路径上会降低长期效率，而主动移动障碍物可以优化多代理的导航效率。

Method: 结合外感和本体反馈评估障碍物的可推动性，利用机器人操纵器与障碍物交互的力反馈作为引导信号。

Result: 初步实验表明，通过推动障碍物而非避障，可以显著提升多代理在长期使用路径上的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为非结构化环境中的导航提供了新思路，尤其在需要自主基础设施开发的场景（如月球或火星表面）中具有潜力。

Abstract: In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the
predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path
planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an
indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the
obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that
will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and
lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we
propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured
environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic
manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates
exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of
obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our
preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both
the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation
module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle
via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our
navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple
agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in
environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as
lunar or Martian surfaces.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for
Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), their robustness in real-world conditions,
particularly under external disturbances, remains insufficiently explored. In
this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture
floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain
randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing
its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an
off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations
in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance
degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that
the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with
the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into
effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical
considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.

Conclusion: IN-RIL是一种通用插件，可显著提升RL微调效果，适用于多种任务和算法。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct
advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from
demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While
existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by
RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often
suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning
phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning
and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL
updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of
IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout
the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization
objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive
interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting
gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes
learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot
manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including
FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can
significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse
during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either
sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g.,
from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic
Transport. Project page: https://github.com/ucd-dare/IN-RIL.

Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中样本效率低且缺乏可解释性，限制了其实际应用。通过知识捕获与适应提升智能体对多样化场景的理解和适应能力是关键。

Method: 提出KCAC框架，通过重新设计奖励函数和定义子任务，实现跨任务课程学习。

Result: KCAC在训练时间减少40%的同时，任务成功率提高10%。

Conclusion: KCAC为课程设计提供了优化参数和概念指导，对强化学习和机器人学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic
manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of
interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling
the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse
working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key
factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,
and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer
into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two
block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic
manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to
solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In
this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid
constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards
concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two
self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to
facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40
percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10
percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we
identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,
and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual
guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights
into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.

Conclusion: FORTRESS通过结合开放世界多模态推理和动态感知规划，显著提升了系统安全性和规划效率。

Abstract: Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot
data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and
on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally

heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

### [165] [Sybil-based Virtual Data Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09983)
*Changxun Zhu,Qilong Wu,Lingjuan Lyu,Shibei Xue*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Sybil节点的虚拟数据投毒攻击方法，通过梯度匹配降低计算复杂度，并在非独立同分布数据下优于现有攻击算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受恶意攻击，现有方法成本高，需更高效的攻击手段。

Method: 提出Sybil节点生成虚拟数据，基于梯度匹配降低计算复杂度，设计三种目标模型获取方案。

Result: 在仿真中，该方法在非独立同分布数据下优于其他攻击算法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于多种场景，为联邦学习安全研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious
adversaries. Existing methods often involve high costs to achieve effective
attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a sybil-based virtual data
poisoning attack, where a malicious client generates sybil nodes to amplify the
poisoning model's impact. To reduce neural network computational complexity, we
develop a virtual data generation method based on gradient matching. We also
design three schemes for target model acquisition, applicable to online local,
online global, and offline scenarios. In simulation, our method outperforms
other attack algorithms since our method can obtain a global target model under
non-independent uniformly distributed data.

### [166] [PIG: Privacy Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Gradient-based Iterative In-Context Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09921)
*Yidan Wang,Yanan Cao,Yubing Ren,Fang Fang,Zheng Lin,Binxing Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs的隐私风险，提出了一种名为PIG的新框架，用于通过jailbreak攻击提取敏感信息，并在实验中验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在隐私泄露风险，现有评估方法易被规避，而jailbreak攻击在隐私场景中的作用尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出PIG框架，通过识别PII实体、构建隐私上下文，并利用梯度策略迭代更新以提取目标PII。

Result: PIG在四种白盒和两种黑盒LLMs上表现优于基线方法，达到SoTA效果。

Conclusion: LLMs存在显著的隐私风险，需加强防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent
privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use
memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which
well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM
safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy
scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of
jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage
and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework
targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the
limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII
entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build
a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based
strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods
using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two
black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy
risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在网络安全应用中的潜力与风险，如数据泄露和恶意软件生成，旨在开发更安全的微调方法。

Method: 基于OWASP Top 10框架评估七种开源LLMs的安全性，并提出通过重写指令-响应对的安全对齐方法。

Result: 微调降低了所有测试LLMs的安全韧性（如Llama 3.1 8B的提示注入安全分从0.95降至0.15），但安全对齐方法能有效提升安全性。

Conclusion: 安全对齐方法可在保持技术效用的同时提升模型安全性，为敏感领域的安全LLMs开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security
applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat
analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and
safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of
new malware. We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned
LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B,
Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B.
Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all
tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection
drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach
that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety
precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is
possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical
utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning
methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in
LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and
contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically
aligned LLMs.

*Hexu Li,Konstantinos Kalogiannis,Ahmed Mohamed Hussain,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AttentionGuard是一个基于Transformer的框架，用于检测车辆编队系统中的异常行为，通过自注意力机制识别攻击，实验显示其F1分数高达0.95，适用于实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆编队系统虽然能提高燃油效率和道路利用率，但容易受到内部认证用户的复杂伪造攻击，可能导致灾难性碰撞，因此需要有效的异常行为检测方法。

Method: 提出AttentionGuard，利用多头部Transformer编码器处理运动数据，区分正常行为和伪造攻击，覆盖多种编队场景（稳态、加入、退出等）。

Result: 在模拟数据集中，AttentionGuard的F1分数达到0.95，延迟低至100ms，适用于实时安全应用，且在不同攻击类型和操作参数下表现稳健。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器是一种有前景的方法，能够有效保护协作智能交通系统（C-ITS）免受复杂内部威胁。

Abstract: Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated
through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits
in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to
sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can
destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This
paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning
systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for
misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify
anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head
transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling
effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification
attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state
(no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an
extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant,
gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller
types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results
demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack
detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers.
Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision
intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety
applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and
establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider
threats.

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized AI, powering applications like content
generation and sentiment analysis. However, their deployment in Machine
Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises significant privacy concerns, primarily
due to the centralized processing of sensitive user data. Private Transformer
Inference (PTI) offers a solution by utilizing cryptographic techniques such as
secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, enabling inference
while preserving both user data and model privacy. This paper reviews recent
PTI advancements, highlighting state-of-the-art solutions and challenges. We
also introduce a structured taxonomy and evaluation framework for PTI, focusing
on balancing resource efficiency with privacy and bridging the gap between
high-performance inference and data privacy.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过LLM降低渗透测试成本，提高测试频率。

Method: 开发了AutoPentest工具，结合GPT-4o和LangChain，支持多步骤任务和外部工具集成，并在Hack The Box机器上进行实验。

Result: AutoPentest和ChatGPT均完成15-25%的子任务，前者略优；AutoPentest总成本为96.20美元，ChatGPT Plus月费20美元。

Conclusion: 未来通过优化实现和更强大的LLM，AutoPentest有望成为漏洞管理的可行工具。

Abstract: A recent area of increasing research is the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in penetration testing, which promises to reduce costs and thus allow
for higher frequency. We conduct a review of related work, identifying best
practices and common evaluation issues. We then present AutoPentest, an
application for performing black-box penetration tests with a high degree of
autonomy. AutoPentest is based on the LLM GPT-4o from OpenAI and the LLM agent
framework LangChain. It can perform complex multi-step tasks, augmented by
external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three
capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our
implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the
ChatGPT-4o user interface. Both approaches are able to complete 15-25 % of the
subtasks on the HTB machines, with AutoPentest slightly outperforming ChatGPT.
We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all
experiments, while a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus costs \$20. The
results show that further implementation efforts and the use of more powerful
LLMs released in the future are likely to make this a viable part of
vulnerability management.

TL;DR: AACT系统通过学习SOC分析师对网络安全警报的分类行为，自动化SOC工作流程，显著减少分析师处理的警报数量，提高恶意警报识别效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业网络规模扩大导致安全警报数量激增，SOC分析师面临警报疲劳问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: AACT系统通过分析SOC分析师的历史分类行为，实时预测警报分类决策，自动关闭良性警报并优先处理关键警报。

Result: 在真实SOC环境和开放数据集上表现优异，减少61%的警报展示量，误报率仅为1.36%。

Conclusion: AACT系统有效缓解了SOC分析师的警报疲劳问题，提升了恶意活动的识别效率。

Abstract: Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack
surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security
controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to
identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the
overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC
providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited
visibility into business processes.
  A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by
learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately
predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed
automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue
allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats.
The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open
dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign
alerts.
  Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC
environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a
low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体路径规划（MAPF）问题中考虑智能体大小时的复杂性，首次证明该问题是NP-hard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中（如机器人领域），智能体的大小不可忽略，但此前未明确考虑智能体大小时问题的复杂性。

Method: 通过将经典的3SAT问题（NP完全问题）归约到MAPF问题，构造特定图例证明其NP-hard性。

Result: 证明了考虑智能体大小的MAPF问题是NP-hard，不存在多项式时间算法（假设P≠NP）。

Conclusion: 首次明确了考虑智能体大小的MAPF问题的计算复杂性，为后续研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.

Result: 在自动序列的实际案例中验证了方法的有效性，显著改善了最坏情况下的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，已实现为开源库，可供用户实验。

Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the NFA canonization problem, which
introduces intermediate minimization steps to reduce the exploration space
on-the-fly. Essential to our approach are so-called equivalence registries
which manage information about equivalent states and allow for incorporating
further optimization techniques such as convexity closures or simulation to
boost performance. Due to the generality of our approach, these concepts can be
embedded in classic subset construction or Brzozowski's approach. We evaluate
our approach on a set of real-world examples from automatic sequences and
observe that we are able to improve especially worst-case scenarios. We
implement our approach in an open-source library for users to experiment with.

Motivation: SNN训练中，替代梯度支持宽度gamma的选择存在困境：过大导致神经元过度激活和能耗增加，过小导致梯度消失和时间依赖性减弱。

Method: 提出了一种时间抑制性漏积分发放（ILIF）神经元模型，通过引入抑制性单元调节膜电位和电流，平衡gamma选择。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，ILIF能有效缓解过度激活，减少发放率，提升能效，同时稳定训练并提高准确性。

Conclusion: ILIF模型为SNN训练中的gamma困境提供了有效解决方案，兼具生物合理性和实用性。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its
energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train
SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the
non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives
within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold,
referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major
challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to
overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn
increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients
and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal
Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological
inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units
for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while
preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF
effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on
multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing
rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: Quantifying the causal influence of input features within neural networks has
become a topic of increasing interest. Existing approaches typically assess
direct, indirect, and total causal effects. This work treats NNs as structural
causal models (SCMs) and extends our focus to include intrinsic causal

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating differences in two multi-attribute
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) which are known to have similar structure,
using a penalized D-trace loss function with non-convex penalties. The GGM
structure is encoded in its precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Existing
methods for multi-attribute differential graph estimation are based on a group
lasso penalized loss function. In this paper, we consider a penalized D-trace
loss function with non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation
(SCAD)) penalties. Two proximal gradient descent methods are presented to
optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing sufficient
conditions for consistency in support recovery, convexity and estimation in
high-dimensional settings is provided. We illustrate our approaches with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和工业应用中，获取大量空间分布数据（如气候模型）成本高昂，需要高效的统计模拟方法。传统MLE计算量大，尤其是对大规模非平稳场。

Method: 利用SAR模型的参数可排列为规则网格的特点，将输入（空间场）和输出（模型参数）视为图像，采用I2I网络进行参数估计。

Result: I2I网络能够更快、更准确地估计非平稳SAR模型的参数，适用于前所未有的复杂模型。

Conclusion: I2I网络为SAR模型的参数估计提供了一种高效且准确的替代方案，尤其适用于计算成本高昂的应用场景。

Abstract: In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of
instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field')
but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global
temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,
and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively
expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers
an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.
However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is
computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,
many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial
fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a
popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a
simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on
a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can
be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image
(I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class
of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.

Result: 该方法在大多数情况下与商业求解器在资产选择上表现一致，少数情况下差异微小且组合方差误差可忽略。

Conclusion: 提出的梯度方法高效且可扩展，适用于大规模稀疏投资组合优化问题。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization involves selecting asset weights to minimize a
risk-reward objective, such as the portfolio variance in the classical
minimum-variance framework. Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing
a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be
included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer
quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal
solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase
exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even
moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that
transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained
continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving
equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our
algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective
from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting
point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the
tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In
practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most
instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst
showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.

Conclusion: 路径梯度微调是一种有效的混合方法，可显著提升CNFs在分子系统中的采样效率，同时保持其结构。

Abstract: Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for
generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using
Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped
speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex
molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration
trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune
CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy
is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a
threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while
using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for
additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow
trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve
the learned structure of the flow.

Motivation: 现有单阶段L2D方法仅限于延迟到单个专家，本文旨在通过联合优化预测和延迟，实现多实体的高效选择。

Method: 定义了一种成本敏感的损失函数，并推导出一个与$k$无关的凸代理，支持跨Top-$k$范围的泛化。还提出了动态选择$k$的自适应变体Top-$k(x)$。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和SVHN上的实验表明，Top-$k$方法优于Top-1延迟，而Top-$k(x)$通过动态调整实现了更优的精度-成本权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅统一了预测和延迟，还通过动态调整$k$值进一步优化了性能，为多实体选择提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which
unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that
selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While
existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our
approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities
through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and
derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality
parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without
retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior
score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both
Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We
further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects
the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and
consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage
Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves
superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.

Abstract: Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is challenging when
the likelihood function is irregular and expensive to compute. We explore
several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce
computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where
gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we
introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel
computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive
evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task
with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved
version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with
adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in
a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide
cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can
pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These
two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve
efficient, exact sampling.

*Juehang Qin,Shixiao Liang,Christopher Tunnell*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: FlowVAT是一种基于条件调温的归一化流变分推断方法，解决了多模态和高维后验分布中的模式塌缩问题，无需复杂调参或退火计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态和高维后验分布对变分推断提出了挑战，传统退火方法需要调参且效果有限，无法实现真正的黑盒推断。

Method: FlowVAT通过同时调温基分布和目标分布，并利用归一化流的温度条件化，训练单一流模型覆盖不同温度范围的后验分布。

Result: 在2、10和20维多模态分布实验中，FlowVAT优于传统和自适应退火方法，发现更多模式且ELBO值更优。

Conclusion: FlowVAT无需复杂调参或退火计划，为复杂后验分布提供了更自动化的黑盒变分推断方法。

Abstract: Multi-modal and high-dimensional posteriors present significant challenges
for variational inference, causing mode-seeking behavior and collapse despite
the theoretical expressiveness of normalizing flows. Traditional annealing
methods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short
of the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a
conditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that
addresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target
distributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By
conditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized
neural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow
representing the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes
identified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior
at $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In
experiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT
outperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and
achieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing
approaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not
require an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box
variational inference for complicated posteriors.

Motivation: 研究动机源于医学和营销等领域中在线反馈受限的问题，需要一种适应性强且易于实现的非参数方法。

Method: BaNk-UCB算法结合自适应k-NN回归和UCB原则，利用局部几何估计奖励并平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在标准Lipschitz平滑性和边界假设下，算法提供了接近最优的遗憾保证，并在实验中优于基于分箱的基线方法。

Conclusion: BaNk-UCB是一种高效的非参数方法，适用于有限批次的上下文赌博机问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual
bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small
number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and
marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric
algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the
upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully
nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement.
Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB
uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and
exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard
Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated
batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal
rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.

Abstract: Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical
transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external
forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of
bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is
characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and
diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early
Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical
signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong
predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a
machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can
effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'
capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation
transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase
transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS
detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models
can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is
encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to
illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of
ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed
statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing
between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model
performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are
interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model
generalization.

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges
in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of
exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present
a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify
patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified
stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and
echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of
these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the
obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of
patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%),
ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we
obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However,
it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF
because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the
PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are
working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification
models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth
project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and
personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value
and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results
with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results
indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly
consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic
features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种风险感知的安全强化学习（RL）控制设计，用于随机离散时间线性系统。通过同时学习RL控制器和安全控制器，并优化决策变量，实现了高效、安全且数据需求低的控制方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全强化学习方法依赖于高精度模型和大量数据，且可能因短视干预导致不理想的收敛。本文旨在通过结合RL和安全控制器，解决这些问题。

Method: 1) 学习分段仿射控制器以扩大不变集；2) 通过决策变量和线性规划优化安全性；3) 提出数据驱动的插值技术整合RL与安全控制器。

Result: 该方法在有限数据下实现了高置信度的安全性，减少了安全违规的方差，并通过仿真验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 结合RL与安全控制器的风险感知方法在保证安全性的同时，降低了数据需求和计算复杂度，适用于噪声环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control
design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety
certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe
controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe
controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this
approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a
high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic
interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by
deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly
efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing
over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To
learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers
are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system
is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The
effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the
closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such
that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is
minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data
requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to
integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation
technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal
implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by
noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate
the theoretical results.

Conclusion: 该框架可行，为混合物组分重构和过程集成建模提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pure component physiochemical properties is crucial
for process integration, multiscale modeling, and optimization. In this work,
an enhanced framework for pure component property prediction by using
explainable machine learning methods is proposed. In this framework, the
molecular representation method based on the connectivity matrix effectively
considers atomic bonding relationships to automatically generate features. The
supervised machine learning model random forest is applied for feature ranking
and pooling. The adjusted R2 is introduced to penalize the inclusion of
additional features, providing an assessment of the true contribution of
features. The prediction results for normal boiling point (Tb), liquid molar
volume, critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) obtained using
Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Process Regression models confirm the
accuracy of the molecular representation method. Comparison with GC based
models shows that the root-mean-square error on the test set can be reduced by
up to 83.8%. To enhance the interpretability of the model, a feature analysis
method based on Shapley values is employed to determine the contribution of
each feature to the property predictions. The results indicate that using the
feature pooling method reduces the number of features from 13316 to 100 without
compromising model accuracy. The feature analysis results for Tb, Tc, and Pc
confirms that different molecular properties are influenced by different
structural features, aligning with mechanistic interpretations. In conclusion,
the proposed framework is demonstrated to be feasible and provides a solid
foundation for mixture component reconstruction and process integration
modelling.

Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has emerged as a promising treatment
for Parkinson disease (PD). In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends
dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback:
an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for
optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic
models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we
introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said
models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal
ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15
previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and
noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability -
all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via
beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built
our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for
optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community
to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.

have little explicit information about who is watching the devices at any time
(individuals or groups). Also, we do not have a way to combine more than one
individual profile to make better recommendations for group viewing. We propose
a novel framework using a Gaussian mixture model averaging to obtain point
estimates for the number of household TV profiles and a Bayesian random walk
model to introduce uncertainty. We applied our approach using data from real
customers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million
observations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the
selected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV
profiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and
quantification of uncertainty.

Conclusion: LLMs为MRS带来了灵活性和泛化能力，但需进一步研究解决挑战，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item
data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance
recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs)
introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context
learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language
models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities
but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility.
This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection
of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and
data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise
integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related
recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets,
and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of
LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly
evolving field.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ChartFinder的CLIP-based模型，用于改进文本到图表的检索性能。通过自动生成全面的语义洞察数据，并结合视觉和语义信息，显著提升了检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图表检索系统因缺乏全面的语义洞察数据而表现不佳，无法充分理解图表的语义和上下文信息。

Method: 开发了一个训练数据生成管道，自动合成图表的层次化语义洞察（视觉、统计、任务导向），并基于这些数据训练CLIP-based模型ChartFinder。

Result: 在CRBench基准测试中，ChartFinder在精确查询和模糊查询任务中均显著优于现有方法，NDCG@10提升11.58%。

Conclusion: 通过结合丰富的语义洞察，ChartFinder能够更好地理解图表的视觉和语义信息，为文本到图表检索任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart
retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence
(BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical
needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are
well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require
understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing
text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content
and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of
comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we
propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes
hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns
(visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical
applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for
69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to
learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method
leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model
that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate
text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench,
for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI
applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd
workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing
methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise
queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than
state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates
consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all
metrics.

*Dario Di Palma,Felice Antonio Merra,Maurizio Sfilio,Vito Walter Anelli,Fedelucio Narducci,Tommaso Di Noia*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否记忆了公开推荐数据集MovieLens-1M，并分析了记忆对推荐性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs在推荐任务中的应用，但忽视了其是否记忆了公开数据集的问题，这可能影响研究结果的泛化性和加剧偏见。

Method: 通过定义数据集记忆（包括项目属性、用户画像和用户-项目交互的可检索性），分析记忆对推荐性能的影响，并比较不同模型家族和大小的记忆差异。

Result: 所有模型均表现出对MovieLens-1M的记忆，且推荐性能与记忆程度相关。

Conclusion: LLMs确实记忆了公开推荐数据集，记忆程度影响推荐性能，需在研究中加以关注。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to
recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding
and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use
of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to
verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of
their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the
generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets
does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization
can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more
frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public
recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and
Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset
in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as
the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions
can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of
memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether
memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal
that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that
recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have
made all the code publicly available at:

*Filippo Olimpieri,Noemi Giustini,Andrea Lacava,Salvatore D'Oro,Tommaso Melodia,Francesca Cuomo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于dApps和LibIQ库的实时RF频谱分类方法，解决了O-RAN架构中RIC的延迟和数据隐私限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN架构中的RIC存在数据交换延迟和无法访问用户明文数据的限制，阻碍了实时监控和频谱分类等应用。

Method: 利用LibIQ库处理I/Q样本，通过CNN分类RF信号，并在5G部署和OTA测试平台上验证。

Result: 模型在实时分析中平均准确率达到97.8%，能够高效分类不同场景下的信号类型。

Conclusion: LibIQ和数据集将公开，为实时频谱分析提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN
softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and
control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate
near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps.
However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange
between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to
access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use
cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage
the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a
novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and
signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as
time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and
spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to
detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN
inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an
extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct
signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the
Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by
deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies,
time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model
classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of
approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We
pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available
framework upon acceptance.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于外核探测器实时测量数据重建核反应堆中子通量空间分布的方法，利用Kirchhoff-Helmholtz方程作为数学框架，并通过数值方法解决复杂几何中的格林函数问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核反应堆中子通量的空间分布重建对反应堆安全监测至关重要，但复杂几何和异质性使得格林函数解析解难以获得。

Method: 通过Kirchhoff-Helmholtz方程将问题转化为逆问题，推导格林函数并验证其对称性，结合中子扩散模型实现通量重建。

Result: 证明了从采样数据推断的格林函数的存在性和唯一性，验证了方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂核反应堆中子通量重建提供了可靠的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution
of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements
obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation
inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain
based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this
task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the
domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for
Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex,
heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach.
The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the
data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H
equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that
the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the
one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive
description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing
the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and
uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are
demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its
predictions.

TL;DR: LanTu是一种基于动力学增强深度学习的区域涡旋分辨海洋预报系统，通过多尺度物理约束优化，显著提升了中尺度涡旋演化的预报能力，性能优于现有数值和AI预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中尺度涡旋对全球海洋能量级联有重要影响，但传统数值模型在预报中面临科学挑战和高计算成本，AI预报系统需解决复杂多尺度特征的挑战。

Method: 开发了LanTu系统，结合跨尺度相互作用和多尺度物理约束，利用涡旋动力学知识优化深度学习模型。

Result: LanTu在温度、盐度、海平面异常和洋流预报上优于现有数值和AI系统，预报时效超过10天。

Conclusion: 动力学增强深度学习（LanTu）是中尺度涡旋海洋预报的有效范式。

Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the
ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be
ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection
for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific
challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are
becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational
efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical
system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting
(especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep
learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct
multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy
dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale
evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced
operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean
forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and
current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights
that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.

Motivation: 理解受灾人群在野火危机中的感知和反应，为及时和同理心的灾害响应提供支持。

Method: 收集385篇帖子和114,879条评论，采用主题建模方法（结合LLMs和HITL）和分层框架（SA和CN）分析。

Result: SA类别与火灾进展高度相关，公众健康和心理健康是主要关注点。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个标注社交媒体数据集，为灾害响应和公共健康沟通提供了可扩展的分析框架。

Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent
years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during
wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social
media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public
discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment.
This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires,
spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385
posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt
topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large
language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we
develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two
main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The
volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking
within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most
frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and
damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related
latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one
health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60
percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest
total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated
social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable
multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse
analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can
inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public
health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related
disaster events.

Motivation: 现有GCNs在最大化模块化时易陷入次优解，且直接使用人类标签社区可能破坏拓扑连贯性。

Method: 提出TAS-Com方法，结合Leiden算法优化损失函数，确保社区连通性并平衡模块化与人类标签。

Result: 在多个基准网络上，TAS-Com显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TAS-Com在社区检测中实现了模块化与人类标签的优化平衡，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers
cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute
similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions.
Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can
undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely
on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological
and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com
introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and
scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal
modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to
ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community
structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with
human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that
TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: 将AI负载与风电场电力供应结合，通过智能路由优化，能显著提升计算效率和绿色能源利用率。

Abstract: AI power demand is growing unprecedentedly thanks to the high power density
of AI compute and the emerging inferencing workload. On the supply side,
abundant wind power is waiting for grid access in interconnection queues. In
this light, this paper argues bringing AI workload to modular compute clusters
co-located in wind farms. Our deployment right-sizing strategy makes it
economically viable to deploy more than 6 million high-end GPUs today that
could consume cheap, green power at its source. We built Heron, a cross-site
software router, that could efficiently leverage the complementarity of power
generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power
drops. Using 1-week ofcoding and conversation production traces from Azure and
(real) variable wind power traces, we show how Heron improves aggregate goodput

Conclusion: KAITIAN为复杂AI应用中的异构计算提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and
intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous
accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing
and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific
proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability
barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types
and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in
distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed
communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified
abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication
libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication
protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a
load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational
tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance
characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously
evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN
demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability
for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can
accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems,
while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining
model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful
heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.

Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders
demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the
seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2)

Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling
distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to
handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration
of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important
effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking
amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning
approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used
to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from
data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with
neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical
systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear
vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for
nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily
accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the
network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic
data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained
to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are
presented.

### [210] [Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444)
*Miguel Aguilera,Sosuke Ito,Artemy Kolchinsky*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 提出了一种推断高维随机系统中熵产生（EP）的方法，适用于多体系统和非马尔可夫系统。通过非平衡最大熵原理和凸对偶性，利用轨迹观测样本推断EP，无需重构高维概率分布或速率矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维随机系统中标准EP估计方法因计算和统计限制难以应用，需开发新方法。

Method: 利用非平衡最大熵原理和凸对偶性，通过轨迹观测样本推断EP及其下界。

Result: 方法在1000个自旋的无序非平衡自旋模型和大型神经尖峰数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维系统EP推断提供了高效且物理直观的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional
stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with
long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such
systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer
trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a
nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex
duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as
spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of
high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special
assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to
compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from
different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical
interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its
numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins
and a large neural spike-train dataset.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂系统提供了一种低成本、稳健的相变分析方法，适用于更广泛的凝聚态和统计物理问题。

Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial
neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity
with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which
lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a
supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an
unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders
trained solely on idealized spin configurations.
  To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of
physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which
preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we
include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,
reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms,
acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in
the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions
through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and
percolation thresholds.
  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient
training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in
complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to
conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter
and statistical physics contexts.

Motivation: 研究非单调推理的复杂性，尤其是溯因推理，以弥补当前对单调推理与非单调推理之间理解的不平衡。

Method: 通过分析知识库中变量数量（参数n）的复杂性，研究了Σ²P、NP和coNP完全片段的溯因问题。

Result: 获得了多个积极结果，首次在Σ²P完全问题中实现了超越穷举搜索的突破，并提供了基于强指数时间假设的下界。

Conclusion: 论文为非单调推理的复杂性研究提供了新视角，展示了在特定参数下超越传统方法的可能性。

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a well-known example of monotonic
reasoning, of intense practical interest due to fast solvers, complemented by
rigorous fine-grained complexity results. However, for non-monotonic reasoning,
e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic
complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap
between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of
intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural
parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several
positive results for $\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments,
which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement
this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the
(strong) exponential-time hypothesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UOD的领域自适应一次性医学标志物检测框架，用于处理多领域医学图像，通过两阶段和两个通用模型设计解决了现有方法的领域偏好和鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一次性学习方法在单领域表现良好，但在多领域无标签数据中表现不佳，且对标注图像质量敏感。

Method: UOD包含两阶段：第一阶段通过自监督学习生成伪标签；第二阶段设计领域自适应Transformer消除领域偏好并构建全局上下文。

Result: 在三个X-ray数据集上取得最优性能。

Conclusion: UOD在多领域医学图像中实现了鲁棒且准确的标志物检测。

Abstract: One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great
success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot
learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain
preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover,
one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating
a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a
domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain
medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two
stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as
combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first
stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to
generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a
domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global
context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each
domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate
all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We
investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three
widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head,
hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain. The
code is available at

Abstract: Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric
geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern
spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation
Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive
technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging
large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have
demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured
geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent
integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal
geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey
presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across
both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on
the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological
perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current
advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future
research directions in the LLM era. This work offers a thorough exploration of
the field and providing a roadmap for further innovation in LI. The summary of

TL;DR: MoB提出了一种多目标平衡覆盖方法，通过贪心半径分配解决视觉令牌剪枝中的目标权衡问题，显著提升了性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法采用静态策略，忽略了任务间目标重要性的动态变化，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 基于Hausdorff距离推导误差界，利用ε-覆盖理论量化目标权衡，提出MoB框架，将剪枝问题转化为双目标覆盖问题。

Result: MoB在LLaVA-1.5-7B上仅用11.1%的视觉令牌保留96.4%性能，加速LLaVA-Next-7B 1.3-1.5倍，且适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: MoB通过动态权衡目标与高效预算分配，为视觉令牌剪枝提供了可扩展且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual
preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative
importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent
performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for
visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing
the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering
theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify
their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle
this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which
reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this
framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy
radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability
with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to
challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves
96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual
tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible
performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm
that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language
tasks.

Motivation: 视觉叙事系统在跨帧保持角色一致性和将动作与主体正确关联方面存在困难，导致参考幻觉。

Method: 提出StoryReasoning数据集，包含4,178个故事和52,016张电影图像，采用结构化场景分析和基于视觉相似性与面部识别的跨帧对象重识别方法。

Result: 微调Qwen2.5-VL 7B模型后，Qwen Storyteller将平均每故事的幻觉现象从4.06减少到3.56（-12.3%）。

Conclusion: 通过视觉实体链接和结构化推理，StoryReasoning和Qwen Storyteller显著提升了视觉叙事的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across
frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to
referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of
characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose
StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie
images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story
maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly
modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations.
Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual
similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit
narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to
visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end
object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining
consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a
reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when
compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

Abstract: Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large
Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate
details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving,
hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal
alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate
corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two
modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset
with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,
FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.
Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures
and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math
instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with
ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on
MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a
new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and

achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be

Motivation: 现有方法在提示模板设计、复杂令牌交互或需要额外微调方面存在局限性，AdaptCLIP旨在解决这些问题，提供更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Method: AdaptCLIP在CLIP模型的基础上添加了三个简单适配器（视觉适配器、文本适配器和提示查询适配器），交替学习视觉和文本表示，并结合上下文和对齐残差特征进行对比学习。

Result: 在12个工业和医疗领域的异常检测基准测试中，AdaptCLIP表现优于现有方法，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AdaptCLIP是一种简单有效的方法，支持零样本/少样本跨域泛化，无需在目标域上进行额外训练，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or
unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open
scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language
models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal
images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,
complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in
limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method
called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual
representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,
comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate
both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on
residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,
adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and
prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports
zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free
manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial
and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.
We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban
intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road
users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable
Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts
with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a
sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at
intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal
dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer
self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical
for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving
real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by
integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach
can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of
crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring
smoother and safer interactions for all road users.

Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital
role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the
cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address
this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one
million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document
levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different
architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes,
and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the
performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's
Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four
closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas
among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful
assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in
Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR
but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is

*Matthias Kümmerer,Harneet Khanuja,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新架构，通过少量数据集特定参数解决跨数据集显著性预测的泛化问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性预测模型在跨数据集测试时性能显著下降（约40%），且数据集多样性无法解决这一问题。研究发现60%的性能差距源于数据集特定偏差。

Method: 提出了一种扩展的编码器-解码器结构，仅使用少于20个数据集特定参数控制可解释机制（如多尺度结构、中心偏差和注视扩散）。

Result: 模型在MIT/Tuebingen显著性基准测试（MIT300、CAT2000和COCO-Freeview）中达到新最优性能，泛化能力提升75%以上，且仅需50个样本即可显著改进。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅显著提升了跨数据集显著性预测性能，还揭示了空间显著性属性的复杂多尺度效应。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold
standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we
show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains
challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around
40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly,
increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with
close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining
generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly
dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific
parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure,
center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data
accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of
the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark
(MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from
unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the
respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into
spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine
both absolute and relative sizes.

TL;DR: SpikeVideoFormer是一种高效的脉冲驱动视频Transformer，通过线性时间复杂度和优化的空间-时间注意力设计，在视频任务中表现出色，同时显著提升能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNN-based Transformers主要关注单图像任务，未能充分利用SNN在视频任务中的高效性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA），并分析了多种空间-时间注意力方案，选择最优设计以保持线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在视频分类、人体姿态跟踪和语义分割任务中，性能优于现有SNN方法，提升超过15%，且能效显著优于ANN方法。

Conclusion: SpikeVideoFormer在视频任务中实现了高效且高性能的解决方案，为SNN在视频领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering
superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily
focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively
leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer,
featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design
a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided
adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention.
Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention
designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for
video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The
generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across
diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking,
and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with
over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the
performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency
gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the
three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需配对的训练方法，用于学习型ISP，通过多损失函数和对抗训练实现高质量图像转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发学习型ISP时，获取像素级对齐的配对数据成本高昂且困难，因此需要一种无需配对数据的方法。

Method: 采用多损失函数和对抗训练，利用预训练网络的特征图指导学习，保持内容结构的同时学习目标RGB数据集的颜色和纹理特征。

Result: 在Zurich RAW to RGB和Fujifilm UltraISP数据集上评估，相比配对训练方法，展现出高性能。

Conclusion: 无需配对数据的学习策略在移动设备上具有潜力，能实现高保真度的图像转换。

Abstract: The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern
smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB
images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the
potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with
a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and
costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise
aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to
high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by
proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need
for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with
matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function
guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature
maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning
color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using
lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as
backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm
UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning
strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple
evaluation metrics. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSeqCoco是一种基于深度学习的模型，用于从椰树图像中自动准确识别疾病，其准确率高达99.5%，比现有模型高5%，并显著减少训练和预测时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 椰树疾病对农业产量构成严重威胁，尤其在发展中国家，传统方法难以早期诊断和干预。现有方法手动、耗时且不可扩展。

Method: 开发了DeepSeqCoco模型，测试了SGD、Adam和混合优化器配置，以平衡准确性、损失最小化和计算成本。

Result: 模型准确率达99.5%，混合SGD-Adam验证损失最低为2.81%，训练时间减少18%，预测时间减少85%。

Conclusion: DeepSeqCoco展示了通过AI实现高效、可扩展的疾病监测系统，有望提升精准农业水平。

Abstract: Coconut tree diseases are a serious risk to agricultural yield, particularly
in developing countries where conventional farming practices restrict early
diagnosis and intervention. Current disease identification methods are manual,
labor-intensive, and non-scalable. In response to these limitations, we come up
with DeepSeqCoco, a deep learning based model for accurate and automatic
disease identification from coconut tree images. The model was tested under
various optimizer settings, such as SGD, Adam, and hybrid configurations, to
identify the optimal balance between accuracy, minimization of loss, and
computational cost. Results from experiments indicate that DeepSeqCoco can
achieve as much as 99.5% accuracy (achieving up to 5% higher accuracy than
existing models) with the hybrid SGD-Adam showing the lowest validation loss of
2.81%. It also shows a drop of up to 18% in training time and up to 85% in
prediction time for input images. The results point out the promise of the
model to improve precision agriculture through an AI-based, scalable, and
efficient disease monitoring system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对图像中虚拟对象的理解能力，发现现有模型在此方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是测试VLMs是否真正理解图像中的空间关系，尤其是对虚拟对象的处理能力。

Method: 通过设计包含虚拟对象的提示（如“想象树上有风筝”）来评估VLMs的场景理解能力。

Result: 结果显示，当前先进的VLMs在处理虚拟对象时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结论指出VLMs在场景理解方面仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and
vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing
complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open
question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes
depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual
objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help
test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that
depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt:
imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should
update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations
between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of
state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is
inadequate.

TL;DR: UniEval是一个针对统一多模态模型的无额外模型、图像或标注的评估框架，包含UniBench基准和UniScore指标，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型的评估缺乏统一框架，存在任务特定基准的局限性，如缺乏整体结果、额外评估模型的误差等。

Method: 提出UniEval框架，包含UniBench基准（支持统一和视觉生成模型）和UniScore指标，涵盖81个细粒度标签以提高多样性。

Result: UniBench比现有基准更具挑战性，UniScore与人类评估高度一致，优于当前指标。

Conclusion: UniEval为统一多模态模型提供了简化和统一的评估方法，揭示了其独特价值。

Abstract: The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is
rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance
instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However,
there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would
enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct
evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant
limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation
models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity,
and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework
designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or
annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The
UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both
unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore
metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.
Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing
benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing
current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual
generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了医学图像分割模型在真实临床环境中的性能下降问题，提出MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强方法，显著提升了模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在真实临床环境中因训练与测试分布不匹配导致性能下降，传统数据增强方法缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 系统评估MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强方法，这些方法不针对特定分布偏移源，而是通过提升特征表示来增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法显著提升了心脏电影MRI和前列腺MRI分割中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，特征表示更可分且紧凑。

Conclusion: 将MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强集成到nnU-Net训练流程中，为提升医学分割模型在真实应用中的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets,
leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical
settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data
augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,
traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness
needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically
evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary
Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations
without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We
demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution
generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of
transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We
quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature
representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we
highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an
easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical
segmentation models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了HandReader，包含三种架构（RGB、KP、RGB+KP），用于手语拼写识别，通过TSAM和TPE模块处理视频和关键点信息，在多个数据集上取得最优结果，并发布了俄语手语数据集Znaki。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语拼写识别中，现有方法在时间维度处理上仍有改进空间，需提升准确性。

Method: 提出三种架构：HandReader_RGB（使用TSAM处理RGB视频）、HandReader_KP（使用TPE处理关键点）、HandReader_RGB+KP（结合RGB和关键点）。

Result: 在ChicagoFSWild、ChicagoFSWild+和Znaki数据集上取得最优结果。

Conclusion: HandReader架构显著提升了手语拼写识别性能，并公开了Znaki数据集和预训练模型。

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a significant component of Sign Language (SL), allowing the
interpretation of proper names, characterized by fast hand movements during
signing. Although previous works on fingerspelling recognition have focused on
processing the temporal dimension of videos, there remains room for improving
the accuracy of these approaches. This paper introduces HandReader, a group of
three architectures designed to address the fingerspelling recognition task.
HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to
process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important
sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal
Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition
in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution
layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints
coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint
encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model
possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the
ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate
high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,
presented in this paper. The Znaki dataset and HandReader pre-trained models
are publicly available.

*Yiwen Liu,Jessica Bader,Jae Myung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在生成合成训练数据时，图像可行性（feasibility）是否对CLIP分类器性能有显著影响，实验表明影响微乎其微。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像可能存在不现实的特征（如狗浮在空中），这些图像是否应被排除在训练数据外尚不明确。研究旨在验证可行性对CLIP分类器性能的实际影响。

Method: 提出VariReal流程，通过文本提示对源图像进行最小编辑，生成可行或不可行属性的图像，并在三个细粒度数据集上测试LoRA微调CLIP的性能。

Result: 可行性对分类性能影响极小（差异<0.3%），且不同属性对性能的影响各异。混合可行与不可行图像训练未显著改变性能。

Conclusion: 在CLIP分类器的合成数据训练中，强制要求图像可行性并非必要，混合可行与不可行数据是可行的策略。

Abstract: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

Motivation: 多模态大模型（LMMs）在单图像任务中表现优异，但在多图像问答场景中面临可扩展性和检索性能问题。

Method: 采用查询感知的子模函数（如GraphCut）预选语义相关图像，并结合锚点查询和数据增强优化检索流程。

Result: 在大量图像场景中，该方法显著提升了子模检索器的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过子模子集选择技术优化检索框架，能够有效解决多图像问答任务中的可扩展性和性能问题。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in
vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented
with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering
scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images,
present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval
performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework
introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our
method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to
pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval
component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the
data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in
large haystack sizes.

Result: 研究结果将指导未来DeAgents系统和协议的设计，并为未来AI系统的治理提供参考。

Conclusion: DeAgents在去中心化和自治方面具有潜力，但仍需解决LLM可靠性问题与治理挑战。

Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents)
combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization
technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution
environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents
to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and
control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates
centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust
concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges
in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension
between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this
empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts,
founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance
dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design
and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the
future agentic web.

TL;DR: 论文提出AI LEGO工具，解决跨职能团队在AI开发早期阶段知识传递和伦理风险识别的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨职能团队中，技术专家与非技术角色之间的知识传递不畅，导致伦理风险识别困难。现有工具（如JIRA或Google Docs）无法有效支持联合风险识别。

Method: 通过文献综述和与8名从业者的共同设计研究，开发了AI LEGO原型工具，支持技术与非技术角色通过交互模块和LLM驱动的人设模拟识别潜在风险。

Result: 在18名跨职能从业者的研究中，AI LEGO显著提高了风险识别的数量和可能性，其模块化结构和人设提示使风险识别更易操作。

Conclusion: AI LEGO通过促进早期设计阶段的协作，为负责任的AI开发提供了更清晰和高效的工具。

Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of
addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through
social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work
is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of
transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical
experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm
identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8
practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design
choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by
non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to
support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without
scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google
Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint
harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to
align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based
prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively
facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the
early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft
development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through
stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface
potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO
increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline
worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts
made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more
collaborative RAI practices in early design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reviewer的3D视觉界面，通过实时投影EMG信号到解码器的分类空间，帮助用户直观理解PR算法行为，从而提升肌电假肢的控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌电假肢的PR控制系统在复杂动作下难以生成足够独特的EMG信号模式，用户需通过试错调整解码器边界，效率低下。

Method: 研究通过10次实验，比较了12名健康参与者使用Reviewer与传统虚拟手臂可视化训练后的PR性能，评估指标包括任务完成率、路径效率等。

Result: 使用Reviewer的参与者表现出更高的任务完成率、更少的过冲、更优的路径效率和吞吐量。

Conclusion: 3D视觉反馈通过结构化训练显著提升了新手操作者的PR控制能力，减少了试错调整的依赖。

Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern
recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals
into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users
often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable
classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error
user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,
a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's
classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm
behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,
data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder
boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants
compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the
Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was
assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and
the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer
achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path
efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.
Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,
facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control
improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this
approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more
adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual
feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through
structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance
on extensive heuristic adjustments.

TL;DR: WSW2.0是一个自动化框架，用于分析学前课堂中的语音互动，结合wav2vec2和Whisper技术，显著提升了准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过深度学习技术改进学前课堂语音互动的分析，为教育研究和干预策略提供更精确的数据支持。

Method: 整合wav2vec2进行说话人分类，使用Whisper进行语音转录，并在235分钟的音频数据上进行验证。

Result: 说话人分类的F1分数为0.845，转录质量中高，词错误率分别为0.119（教师）和0.238（儿童）。

Conclusion: WSW2.0展示了深度学习在教育研究中的潜力，能够支持早期语言发展和干预策略的优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces an automated framework WSW2.0 for analyzing vocal
interactions in preschool classrooms, enhancing both accuracy and scalability
through the integration of wav2vec2-based speaker classification and Whisper
(large-v2 and large-v3) speech transcription. A total of 235 minutes of audio
recordings (160 minutes from 12 children and 75 minutes from 5 teachers), were
used to compare system outputs to expert human annotations. WSW2.0 achieves a
weighted F1 score of .845, accuracy of .846, and an error-corrected kappa of
.672 for speaker classification (child vs. teacher). Transcription quality is
moderate to high with word error rates of .119 for teachers and .238 for
children. WSW2.0 exhibits relatively high absolute agreement intraclass
correlations (ICC) with expert transcriptions for a range of classroom language
features. These include teacher and child mean utterance length, lexical
diversity, question asking, and responses to questions and other utterances,
which show absolute agreement intraclass correlations between .64 and .98. To
establish scalability, we apply the framework to an extensive dataset spanning
two years and over 1,592 hours of classroom audio recordings, demonstrating the
framework's robustness for broad real-world applications. These findings
highlight the potential of deep learning and natural language processing
techniques to revolutionize educational research by providing accurate measures
of key features of preschool classroom speech, ultimately guiding more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无偏性、秩限制和最小化误差条件下逼近目标矩阵的问题。

Method: 算法基于对矩阵P的奇异分量进行高效无偏稀疏化处理。

Result: 算法与现有下界匹配，证明了其最优性。

Abstract: We describe an algorithm for sampling a low-rank random matrix $Q$ that best
approximates a fixed target matrix $P\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times m}$ in the
following sense: $Q$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[Q] = P$;
$\mathsf{rank}(Q)\leq r$; and $Q$ minimizes the expected Frobenius norm error
$\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient
unbiased sparsification problem for vectors, except applied to the singular
components of the matrix $P$. Optimality is proven by showing that our
algorithm matches the error from an existing lower bound.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于基础模型的无线定位解决方案（LWLM），通过自监督学习框架优化三个互补目标，显著提升了定位任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法在无线定位中需要大量标注数据且难以泛化的问题。

Method: 设计自监督学习框架，联合优化空间-频率掩码信道建模、域变换不变性和位置不变对比学习三个目标，并设计轻量级解码器用于下游任务。

Result: LWLM在所有定位任务中均优于基于模型和监督学习的基线方法，性能提升26.0%--87.5%，且在标签有限和未见基站配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: LWLM作为无线定位的基础模型具有潜力，能够显著提升定位任务的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

Motivation: 当前临床教育模式无法满足放疗计划质量审查的需求，缺乏灵活性和多样化的示例。

Method: 结合剂量分布预测与自然语言处理，开发了能生成次优训练计划并允许学员通过自然语言提示改进计划的模型。

Result: 模型能快速、准确地生成和修改剂量分布，资源需求低。

Conclusion: 该研究首次结合剂量预测与自然语言处理，为放疗计划教育提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective education in radiotherapy plan quality review requires a robust,
regularly updated set of examples and the flexibility to demonstrate multiple
possible planning approaches and their consequences. However, the current
clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have
developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples
of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan
quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a
dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid,
and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose
distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust
pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to
practice their critical plan review and improvement skills that addresses the
challenges of the current clinic-based paradigm.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合生成语义通信系统（Gen-SemCom），通过结合文本提示和关键语义特征传输，解决了纯提示驱动生成丢失细节的问题，并设计了GVIF指标评估系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯提示驱动的生成语义通信会丢失细粒度视觉细节，且缺乏系统性的评估指标。

Method: 开发了带有关键信息嵌入（CIE）框架的混合Gen-SemCom系统，结合文本提示和关键语义特征传输，并使用扩散生成模型重建图像。提出GVIF指标量化视觉质量。

Result: GVIF指标对视觉保真度敏感，与PSNR和关键信息量相关。优化系统在PSNR和FID分数上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 混合Gen-SemCom系统和GVIF指标有效提升了生成图像的视觉质量和系统性能。

Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial
intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks,
which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts
rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses
fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic
metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these
issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information
embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical
features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic
filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features
of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and
critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a
diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual
information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the
generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,
the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted
features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we
design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume
of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental
results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating
with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized
system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of
higher PSNR and lower FID scores.

Motivation: 研究DatalogMTL中时间区间关联事实与规则矛盾时的不一致性处理方式。

Method: 定义了冲突（最小不一致解释）和修复（恢复一致性的方法），并研究了其属性和容忍不一致的语义。

Result: 分析了生成单个冲突/修复及基于修复语义的查询蕴含任务的数据复杂性。

Conclusion: 论文为DatalogMTL中的不一致性处理提供了理论基础和复杂性分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling in DatalogMTL,
an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators. Since facts are
associated with time intervals, there are different manners to restore
consistency when they contradict the rules, such as removing facts or modifying
their time intervals. Our first contribution is the definition of relevant
notions of conflicts (minimal explanations for inconsistency) and repairs
(possible ways of restoring consistency) for this setting and the study of the
properties of these notions and the associated inconsistency-tolerant
semantics. Our second contribution is a data complexity analysis of the tasks
of generating a single conflict / repair and query entailment under
repair-based semantics.

Conclusion: 该研究为设计可生成经典神经网络参数的QNN提供了一种可扩展且自动化的途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates
the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum
circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown
promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is
hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware
imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges.
To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential
scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters,
enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter
compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such
quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires
expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an
automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly
optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in
an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed
framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning
tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually
designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway
for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across
diverse applications.

Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for
temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature
maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance
in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum
reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical
computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory
retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order
unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we
show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with
increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir
iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with
quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates
generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast,
the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both
reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove
exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving
these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding
concentration in temporal quantum learning models.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法难以处理高维、异构的医疗数据，且缺乏上下文理解，因此研究探索LLM在聚类中的潜力。

Method: 使用LLAMA 3.1 8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B和Stella-En-400M-V5生成嵌入，并应用K-means聚类；与传统方法（如K-Medoids）对比。

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5的轮廓分数最高（0.86），LLM方法能识别具有不同特征的子群，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM在资源有限的环境中具有潜力，可用于上下文表型分析和决策支持。

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in
resource-limited settings.

Abstract: The design and implementation of unit tests is a complex task many
programmers neglect. This research evaluates the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with
manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and
requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and
boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained
programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative
analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on
well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements.
Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This
work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential
complement to automation in unit test evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统漏洞检测方法存在高误报率、可扩展性差和依赖人工的问题，AI方法如LLMs虽有效但复杂且难以解释，SAEs可能提供解决方案。

Method: 研究评估了SAEs在GPT-2 Small和Gemma 2B模型表示中的应用，测试其在无需微调的情况下检测漏洞的能力。

Result: SAEs在漏洞检测中的F1分数高达89%，优于微调的Transformer编码器基线。

Conclusion: SAEs首次被证明可直接从预训练LLMs的内部表示中检测软件漏洞，无需微调或任务特定监督。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a
major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability
detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates,
scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have
driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and
secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new
avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges
for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising
solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight,
interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the
effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and
Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without
fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug
detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned
transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence
that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal
representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific
supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs的推理能力和鲁棒性对其在编程任务中的可靠使用至关重要，但目前研究多关注预测准确性而非推理逻辑。

Method: 应用五种语义保留的代码变异（如重命名变量、交换if-else分支等），评估六种LLMs的推理能力，并结合人类专家分析。

Result: 部分LLMs（如Llama3.2）在61%的情况下基于错误逻辑得出正确预测，且对代码变异的预测不稳定。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码理解中的推理能力存在缺陷，需进一步改进以提高其鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have
assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the
accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them.
Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can
arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar
issues in code understanding.
  In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B
parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply
five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring
comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to
while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while
altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert
analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are
based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across
different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that
some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed
reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in
response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic
understanding.

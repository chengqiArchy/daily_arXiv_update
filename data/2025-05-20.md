### [1] [A Data Synthesis Method Driven by Large Language Models for Proactive Mining of Implicit User Intentions in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11533)
*Jinqiang Wang,Huansheng Ning,Tao Zhu,Jianguo Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的数据合成方法SynPT，用于主动挖掘旅游领域中的隐式用户意图，解决了现有方法的不足，并生成了高质量的训练数据集SynPT-Dialog。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游领域的大语言模型在挖掘用户隐式意图和主动引导用户澄清需求方面存在不足，主要原因是缺乏高质量的训练数据集。

Method: 通过构建LLM驱动的用户代理和助手代理，模拟对话生成SynPT-Dialog数据集，用于微调通用LLM。

Result: 实验表明，SynPT在隐式意图挖掘方面优于现有方法，并分析了关键超参数和实际应用案例。

Conclusion: SynPT方法有效解决了旅游领域隐式意图挖掘的问题，具有实际应用潜力，并公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: In the tourism domain, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to mine
implicit user intentions from tourists' ambiguous inquiries and lack the
capacity to proactively guide users toward clarifying their needs. A critical
bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate
proactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances
leverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer
specialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from
several shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed
distributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy
in the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking
about tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A
Data Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User
Intentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and
assistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese
tourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and
generates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The
dataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine
implicit user intentions. Experimental evaluations, conducted from both human
and LLM perspectives, demonstrate the superiority of SynPT compared to existing
methods. Furthermore, we analyze key hyperparameters and present case studies
to illustrate the practical applicability of our method, including discussions
on its adaptability to English-language scenarios. All code and data are
publicly available.

### [2] [AI-generated Text Detection: A Multifaceted Approach to Binary and Multiclass Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11550)
*Harika Abburi,Sanmitra Bhattacharya,Edward Bowen,Nirmala Pudota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何检测AI生成的文本并识别其来源模型，提出了两种神经网络架构，分别在区分人类与AI文本和模型溯源任务中取得良好成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLMs）可能被滥用（如生成假新闻、垃圾邮件等），准确检测AI生成文本并识别其来源模型对负责任使用LLMs至关重要。

Method: 针对两项任务（区分人类与AI文本和模型溯源），提出了优化的和简化的神经网络架构。

Result: 在区分人类与AI文本任务中，优化模型F1得分为0.994（第五名）；在模型溯源任务中，简化模型F1得分为0.627（第五名）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在检测AI生成文本和模型溯源任务中表现良好，为负责任使用LLMs提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating text that closely resembles human writing across a wide range of
styles and genres. However, such capabilities are prone to potential misuse,
such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic
assignments. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated text and
identification of the model that generated it are crucial for maintaining the
responsible use of LLMs. In this work, we addressed two sub-tasks put forward
by the Defactify workshop under AI-Generated Text Detection shared task at the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025): Task A
involved distinguishing between human-authored or AI-generated text, while Task
B focused on attributing text to its originating language model. For each task,
we proposed two neural architectures: an optimized model and a simpler variant.
For Task A, the optimized neural architecture achieved fifth place with $F1$
score of 0.994, and for Task B, the simpler neural architecture also ranked
fifth place with $F1$ score of 0.627.

### [3] [Assessing Collective Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs via Hidden Profile Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11556)
*Yuxuan Li,Aoi Naito,Hirokazu Shirado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文引入社会心理学中的Hidden Profile范式，用于评估多智能体LLM系统的集体推理失败问题，发现多智能体系统在所有模型中均无法达到单智能体的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏理论基础的基准来系统评估多智能体LLM系统的集体推理失败问题。

Method: 采用Hidden Profile范式，设计包含九个任务的基准，并在GPT-4.1等六种LLM上进行实验。

Result: 多智能体系统在所有模型中表现不如单智能体，且与人类群体表现相似，但存在行为差异（如对社会期望的敏感性）。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估多智能体LLM系统提供了可重复框架，并推动人工集体智能和人机交互的未来研究。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving through distributed information integration, but also risk
replicating collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet, no
theory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In
this paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as
a diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical
information asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent
dynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the
paradigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and
instantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,
including adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments
with GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced
variants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the
accuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective
performance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral
differences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.
Finally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a
cooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that
while cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings,
increased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a
reproducible framework for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems and motivates
future research on artificial collective intelligence and human-AI interaction.

### [4] [Talk to Your Slides: Efficient Slide Editing Agent with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11604)
*Kyudan Jung,Hojun Cho,Jooyeol Yun,Jaehyeok Jang,Jagul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Talk-to-Your-Slides的LLM代理，通过COM通信直接在PowerPoint中编辑幻灯片，采用高低两级处理策略，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注幻灯片生成，而忽略了编辑现有幻灯片的繁琐任务。

Method: 系统采用两级方法：高级处理由LLM代理解析指令并制定编辑计划，低级执行由Python脚本直接操作PowerPoint对象。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在执行成功率、指令忠实度和编辑效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Talk-to-Your-Slides为幻灯片编辑提供了更灵活和上下文感知的解决方案，并提供了TSBench数据集用于评估。

Abstract: Existing research on large language models (LLMs) for PowerPoint
predominantly focuses on slide generation, overlooking the common yet tedious
task of editing existing slides. We introduce Talk-to-Your-Slides, an
LLM-powered agent that directly edits slides within active PowerPoint sessions
through COM communication. Our system employs a two-level approach: (1)
high-level processing where an LLM agent interprets instructions and formulates
editing plans, and (2) low-level execution where Python scripts directly
manipulate PowerPoint objects. Unlike previous methods relying on predefined
operations, our approach enables more flexible and contextually-aware editing.
To facilitate evaluation, we present TSBench, a human-annotated dataset of 379
diverse editing instructions with corresponding slide variations. Experimental
results demonstrate that Talk-to-Your-Slides significantly outperforms baseline
methods in execution success rate, instruction fidelity, and editing
efficiency. Our code and benchmark are available at

### [5] [MedGUIDE: Benchmarking Clinical Decision-Making in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11613)
*Xiaomin Li,Mingye Gao,Yuexing Hao,Taoran Li,Guangya Wan,Zihan Wang,Yijun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedGUIDE是一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能够遵循临床指南的新基准，发现即使是领域特定的LLMs在结构化指南任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在临床决策中是否能够可靠地遵循结构化的临床指南，以确保其在真实临床环境中的安全性。

Method: 基于55个NCCN决策树构建MedGUIDE基准，通过两阶段质量选择过程筛选7,747个高质量样本，评估25种LLMs的性能。

Result: 发现领域特定LLMs在结构化指南任务中表现不佳，尝试通过上下文指南包含或继续预训练提升性能。

Conclusion: MedGUIDE对评估LLMs在临床环境中的安全性和可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Clinical guidelines, typically structured as decision trees, are central to
evidence-based medical practice and critical for ensuring safe and accurate
diagnostic decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether Large Language
Models (LLMs) can reliably follow such structured protocols. In this work, we
introduce MedGUIDE, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to
make guideline-consistent clinical decisions. MedGUIDE is constructed from 55
curated NCCN decision trees across 17 cancer types and uses clinical scenarios
generated by LLMs to create a large pool of multiple-choice diagnostic
questions. We apply a two-stage quality selection process, combining
expert-labeled reward models and LLM-as-a-judge ensembles across ten clinical
and linguistic criteria, to select 7,747 high-quality samples. We evaluate 25
LLMs spanning general-purpose, open-source, and medically specialized models,
and find that even domain-specific LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring
structured guideline adherence. We also test whether performance can be
improved via in-context guideline inclusion or continued pretraining. Our
findings underscore the importance of MedGUIDE in assessing whether LLMs can
operate safely within the procedural frameworks expected in real-world clinical
settings.

### [6] [Steering Risk Preferences in Large Language Models by Aligning Behavioral and Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11615)
*Jian-Qiao Zhu,Haijiang Yan,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过构建'转向向量'编辑Transformer残差流，无需重新训练即可定向改变大语言模型行为。提出一种系统识别转向向量的方法，通过行为方法与神经表征对齐实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不重新训练或微调大语言模型的情况下，通过编辑内部神经激活（转向向量）定向改变模型行为。

Method: 提出一种系统性方法，通过行为方法（如马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛）与神经表征对齐，识别转向向量。以提取风险偏好为例验证方法。

Result: 生成的转向向量能可靠地调控大语言模型输出，使其符合目标行为。

Conclusion: 通过表征工程方法，转向向量为定向调控大语言模型行为提供了一种有效且无需重新训练的手段。

Abstract: Changing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) can be as
straightforward as editing the Transformer's residual streams using
appropriately constructed "steering vectors." These modifications to internal
neural activations, a form of representation engineering, offer an effective
and targeted means of influencing model behavior without retraining or
fine-tuning the model. But how can such steering vectors be systematically
identified? We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by
aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods
(specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural
counterparts. To evaluate this approach, we focus on extracting latent risk
preferences from LLMs and steering their risk-related outputs using the aligned
representations as steering vectors. We show that the resulting steering
vectors successfully and reliably modulate LLM outputs in line with the
targeted behavior.

### [7] [THELMA: Task Based Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Model Applications-RAG Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11626)
*Udita Patel,Rutu Mulkar,Jay Roberts,Cibi Chakravarthy Senthilkumar,Sujay Gandhi,Xiaofei Zheng,Naumaan Nayyar,Rafael Castrillo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: THELMA是一个用于RAG QA应用的无参考评估框架，包含六个相互关联的指标，支持端到端管道的评估和改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为开发者提供无需标注数据或参考响应的RAG QA应用评估工具。

Method: 设计了六个相互依赖的指标，用于全面、细粒度的评估。

Result: THELMA框架能帮助识别需要改进的RAG组件。

Conclusion: THELMA为RAG QA应用提供了一种有效的评估和改进方法。

Abstract: We propose THELMA (Task Based Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Model
Applications), a reference free framework for RAG (Retrieval Augmented
generation) based question answering (QA) applications. THELMA consist of six
interdependent metrics specifically designed for holistic, fine grained
evaluation of RAG QA applications. THELMA framework helps developers and
application owners evaluate, monitor and improve end to end RAG QA pipelines
without requiring labelled sources or reference responses.We also present our
findings on the interplay of the proposed THELMA metrics, which can be
interpreted to identify the specific RAG component needing improvement in QA
applications.

### [8] [Critique-Guided Distillation: Improving Supervised Fine-tuning via Better Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11628)
*Berkcan Kapusuzoglu,Supriyo Chakraborty,Chia-Hsuan Lee,Sambit Sahu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CGD的多阶段框架，通过结合教师模型的解释性评论和优化响应，解决了SFT中的模仿问题，显著提升了数学和语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调（SFT）存在模仿问题，模型仅复制正确响应而不理解其背后原理。

Method: 提出CGD框架，利用教师模型生成的解释性评论和优化响应，训练学生模型学习“模仿什么”和“为什么”。

Result: 在数学（AMC23 +17.5%）和语言理解（MMLU-Pro +6.3%）任务上表现显著提升，并解决了格式漂移问题。

Conclusion: CGD通过整合解释性评论和优化响应，有效解决了SFT的模仿问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from
the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct
responses without \emph{understanding} the underlying rationale. To address
this limitation, we propose \textsc{Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD)}, a
novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated
\emph{explanatory critiques} and \emph{refined responses} into the SFT process.
A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique,
and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response,
thereby learning both \emph{what} to imitate and \emph{why}. Using
entropy-based analysis, we show that \textsc{CGD} reduces refinement
uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform
extensive empirical evaluation of \textsc{CGD}, on variety of benchmark tasks,
and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language
understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format
drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.

### [9] [Can an Easy-to-Hard Curriculum Make Reasoning Emerge in Small Language Models? Evidence from a Four-Stage Curriculum on GPT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11643)
*Xiang Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发顺序课程显著提升小语言模型的推理透明度和样本效率。Cognivolve模型通过四阶段训练，比单阶段基线更快达到目标精度，但最终答案成功率仍低30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开发顺序课程对小语言模型推理能力和效率的影响，以提升透明度和样本效率。

Method: 训练124M参数的GPT-2模型Cognivolve，采用四阶段课程（从词汇匹配到多步符号推理），无需任务特定微调。

Result: Cognivolve在优化步骤减半的情况下达到目标精度，激活更多梯度显著推理头，注意力熵更高。但最终答案成功率低30%。

Conclusion: 开发顺序课程显著提升模型性能，但仍有改进空间，如混合阶段微调和探针扩展。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a developmentally ordered curriculum markedly improves
reasoning transparency and sample-efficiency in small language models (SLMs).
Concretely, we train Cognivolve, a 124 M-parameter GPT-2 model, on a four-stage
syllabus that ascends from lexical matching to multi-step symbolic inference
and then evaluate it without any task-specific fine-tuning. Cognivolve reaches
target accuracy in half the optimization steps of a single-phase baseline,
activates an order-of-magnitude more gradient-salient reasoning heads, and
shifts those heads toward deeper layers, yielding higher-entropy attention that
balances local and long-range context. The same curriculum applied out of order
or with optimizer resets fails to reproduce these gains, confirming that
progression--not extra compute--drives the effect. We also identify open
challenges: final-answer success still lags a conventional run by about 30%,
and our saliency probe under-detects verbal-knowledge heads in the hardest
stage, suggesting directions for mixed-stage fine-tuning and probe expansion.

### [10] [Multilingual Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: A Survey Across NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11665)
*Shubham Vatsal,Harsh Dubey,Aditi Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了多语言提示工程在提升大语言模型（LLMs）跨语言性能中的应用，分析了36篇论文中的39种提示技术，覆盖30种多语言NLP任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在NLP任务中表现优异，但其在多语言环境中的有效性仍面临挑战。多语言提示工程成为无需大量参数调整即可提升LLMs跨语言能力的关键方法。

Method: 通过结构化自然语言提示，研究者从LLMs中提取跨语言知识，并分类了不同提示技术。

Result: 研究覆盖约250种语言的数据集，分析了语言家族和资源水平（高资源与低资源）的分布，提出了潜在的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 多语言提示工程为广泛用户（包括非机器学习专家）提供了利用LLMs能力的途径，未来研究可进一步优化提示技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, ensuring
their effectiveness across multiple languages presents unique challenges.
Multilingual prompt engineering has emerged as a key approach to enhance LLMs'
capabilities in diverse linguistic settings without requiring extensive
parameter re-training or fine-tuning. With growing interest in multilingual
prompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored
various strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks.
By crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully
extracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these
techniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those
without deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of
LLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting
techniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets
that collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs
employed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets.
Additionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and
resource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as
the distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of
prompting methods across different language families. Our survey reviews 36
research papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP
tasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.

### [11] [Ambiguity Resolution in Text-to-Structured Data Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679)
*Zhibo Hu,Chen Wang,Yanfeng Shu,Hye-Young Paik,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过分析潜在空间中模糊文本的表示差异来识别模糊性，从而改进大语言模型（LLMs）在模糊任务（如工具调用和文本到SQL查询）中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中的模糊性是LLMs在文本到结构化数据映射中的主要障碍，现有方法（如ReACT框架或监督微调）未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析模糊问题与其解释之间的关系，设计了一种新的距离度量方法（基于路径核和稀疏自编码器的梯度积分），以识别模糊性。

Result: 提出了一个基于缺失概念预测的新框架，显著提高了LLMs在模糊工具调用任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过潜在空间分析有效识别模糊性，为LLMs在模糊任务中的应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving
accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs),
which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool
calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods of ambiguity handling either
exploit ReACT framework to produce the correct mapping through trial and error,
or supervised fine tuning to guide models to produce a biased mapping to
improve certain tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that
characterizes the representation difference of ambiguous text in the latent
space and leverage the difference to identify ambiguity before mapping them to
structured data. To detect ambiguity of a sentence, we focused on the
relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations and what
cause the LLM ignore multiple interpretations. Different to the distance
calculated by dense embedding vectors, we utilize the observation that
ambiguity is caused by concept missing in latent space of LLM to design a new
distance measurement, computed through the path kernel by the integral of
gradient values for each concepts from sparse-autoencoder (SAE) under each
state. We identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous questions with this
measurement. Based on our observation, We propose a new framework to improve
the performance of LLMs on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing
concepts prediction.

### [12] [Evaluating Design Decisions for Dual Encoder-based Entity Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11683)
*Susanna Rücker,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VerbalizED模型，通过双编码器设计优化实体消歧任务，探索关键设计决策并实现新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双编码器在实体消歧任务中的关键设计决策，如损失函数、相似性度量等，以提升性能。

Method: 提出VerbalizED模型，结合上下文标签描述和高效负采样策略，并探索迭代预测变体。

Result: 在AIDA-Yago数据集上验证有效性，并在ZELDA基准上实现新SOTA。

Conclusion: VerbalizED模型通过优化设计决策显著提升实体消歧性能，为未来研究提供参考。

Abstract: Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of linking mentions in text to
corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Dual Encoders address this by
embedding mentions and label candidates in a shared embedding space and
applying a similarity metric to predict the correct label. In this work, we
focus on evaluating key design decisions for Dual Encoder-based ED, such as its
loss function, similarity metric, label verbalization format, and negative
sampling strategy. We present the resulting model VerbalizED, a document-level
Dual Encoder model that includes contextual label verbalizations and efficient
hard negative sampling. Additionally, we explore an iterative prediction
variant that aims to improve the disambiguation of challenging data points.
Comprehensive experiments on AIDA-Yago validate the effectiveness of our
approach, offering insights into impactful design choices that result in a new
State-of-the-Art system on the ZELDA benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非洲低资源语言在自动语音识别（ASR）技术中的挑战，包括数据稀缺、语言复杂性等，并提出了社区驱动数据收集、轻量级模型等解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲低资源语言在ASR研究中代表性不足，阻碍了技术应用和数字包容性。

Method: 分析了数据稀缺、语言复杂性等挑战，并研究了社区驱动数据收集、自监督学习等方法。

Result: 案例研究表明，定制化解决方案（如基于语素的建模）在非洲语言中具有可行性。

Conclusion: 跨学科合作和持续投资是推动非洲语言ASR技术发展的关键，需兼顾伦理和效率。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed
human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain
significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications.
This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR
systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic
complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical
concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically
analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance
ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies
emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection,
self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and
techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving
various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized
solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR
applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight
the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to
tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the
continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical,
efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic
diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic
participation for speakers of African languages.

*Ana Ezquerro,David Vilares,Anssi Yli-Jyrä,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分层括号概念的序列标记依赖解析编码家族，证明了现有4位投影编码属于此家族但标签数量非最优，并推导出最优分层括号编码，支持更紧凑的非投影性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有依赖解析编码的效率，减少标签数量并支持非投影性。

Method: 基于分层括号概念，推导最优编码方法，最小化符号数量并扩展支持非投影性。

Result: 最优编码仅需12个标签（原需16个），在多种树库上表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 新编码方法在标签效率和解析性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a family of encodings for sequence labeling dependency parsing,
based on the concept of hierarchical bracketing. We prove that the existing
4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the
number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical
bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective
trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also
extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in
a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive
accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一文本和多模态参考解析的框架，通过将提及嵌入映射到对象嵌入，并根据相似性选择提及或对象。实验表明，学习文本参考解析（如共指解析和谓词-论元结构分析）对多模态参考解析性能有积极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话中由代词和省略引起的模糊性，需要整合文本和多模态参考解析，以理解提及与真实世界对象之间的语义关系。

Method: 提出一个框架，将提及嵌入映射到对象嵌入，并通过相似性选择提及或对象。结合文本参考解析（如共指解析和谓词-论元结构分析）。

Result: 模型在代词短语接地任务中表现优于MDETR和GLIP。定性分析表明，引入文本参考关系增强了提及（包括代词和谓词）与对象之间的置信度。

Abstract: Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to
understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects.
Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task.
In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual
and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within
dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses.
This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference
resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting
mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that
learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and
predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in
multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference
resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative
models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates
that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence
scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which
can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MedCaseReasoning数据集，用于评估LLMs在临床诊断推理中的表现，发现现有模型在诊断准确性和推理质量上存在不足，但通过微调可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准（如MedQA和MMLU）仅评估最终答案的准确性，忽略了临床推理过程的质量和忠实性。

Method: 引入MedCaseReasoning数据集，包含14,489个诊断问答案例，每个案例配有详细的临床推理说明。评估了前沿推理LLMs的表现，并通过微调改进模型。

Result: 现有模型表现不佳（如DeepSeek-R1诊断准确率仅48%），但微调后诊断准确性和推理召回率分别提升29%和41%。

Conclusion: MedCaseReasoning填补了医学诊断评估的空白，微调LLMs可显著提升其临床推理能力。

Abstract: Doctors and patients alike increasingly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to
diagnose clinical cases. However, unlike domains such as math or coding, where
correctness can be objectively defined by the final answer, medical diagnosis
requires both the outcome and the reasoning process to be accurate. Currently,
widely used medical benchmarks like MedQA and MMLU assess only accuracy in the
final answer, overlooking the quality and faithfulness of the clinical
reasoning process. To address this limitation, we introduce MedCaseReasoning,
the first open-access dataset for evaluating LLMs on their ability to align
with clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes 14,489
diagnostic question-and-answer cases, each paired with detailed reasoning
statements derived from open-access medical case reports. We evaluate
state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs on MedCaseReasoning and find significant
shortcomings in their diagnoses and reasoning: for instance, the top-performing
open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 48% 10-shot diagnostic accuracy
and mentions only 64% of the clinician reasoning statements (recall). However,
we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on the reasoning traces derived from
MedCaseReasoning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical
reasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively. The
open-source dataset, code, and models are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZeroTuning通过调整初始空语义token的注意力分布，显著提升LLM性能，无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助机制识别任务相关token，可能引入偏差且适用性有限。研究发现初始空语义token是一个被忽视的控制点。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，调整初始token的注意力分布，提出ZeroTuning方法，仅调整一个token即可优化模型行为。

Result: ZeroTuning在文本分类、问答和多轮对话任务中显著提升性能（如Llama-3.1-8B分类任务提升11.71%），且具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始空语义token是LLM中一个有效的控制点，ZeroTuning为推理时优化和模型可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs)
have attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as
a promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically
rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific
tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,
we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial
token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model
behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's
attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent
tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,
we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more
effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a
consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but
varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct
preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we
propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by
applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite
tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text
classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across
models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves
Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its
multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited
resources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,
and prompt variations. Our work sheds light on a previously overlooked control
point in LLMs, offering new insights into both inference-time tuning and model
interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于掩码输入标记的正则化方法，通过随机替换输入标记为[MASK]来提升Transformer模型的性能。实验表明该方法在语言识别和情感分析任务中优于标准正则化技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索掩码输入标记是否能进一步提升Transformer模型在文本分类任务中的性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为“标记掩码正则化”的方法，随机以概率p将输入标记替换为[MASK]标记，引入随机扰动以增强模型对标记间深层依赖的捕捉能力。

Result: 在多种模型（如mBERT、Qwen2.5-0.5B、TinyLlama-1.1B）上，该方法在语言识别和情感分析任务中表现优于标准正则化技术，并确定了任务特定的最佳掩码率（p=0.1为通用默认值）。

Conclusion: 掩码正则化通过输入扰动减少过拟合和梯度平滑的隐式集成效应，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While transformer-based models achieve strong performance on text
classification, we explore whether masking input tokens can further enhance
their effectiveness. We propose token masking regularization, a simple yet
theoretically motivated method that randomly replaces input tokens with a
special [MASK] token at probability p. This introduces stochastic perturbations
during training, leading to implicit gradient averaging that encourages the
model to capture deeper inter-token dependencies. Experiments on language
identification and sentiment analysis -- across diverse models (mBERT,
Qwen2.5-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B) -- show consistent improvements over standard
regularization techniques. We identify task-specific optimal masking rates,
with p = 0.1 as a strong general default. We attribute the gains to two key
effects: (1) input perturbation reduces overfitting, and (2) gradient-level
smoothing acts as implicit ensembling.

Motivation: 多跳问答增加了问答任务的复杂性，因果掩码可能阻碍语言模型的跨上下文推理能力，因此需要探索LMs在多跳问题中的表现和改进方法。

Method: 通过排列检索到的文档顺序，测试不同配置下LMs的表现，并修改因果掩码以增强双向注意力。

Result: 1）Flan-T5家族模型优于因果解码器模型；2）文档顺序与推理链一致时性能最佳；3）修改因果掩码可提升性能；注意力权重峰值与答案正确性相关。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器模型在多跳问答中表现更优，文档顺序和注意力机制调整可显著提升性能，注意力权重分布可作为性能改进的启发式指标。

Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question
answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted
with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant
information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information
sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the
causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In
this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting
search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study
reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the
ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in
MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order
of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned
decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order
aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models
with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively
boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough
investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of
MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher
values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to
heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成NSM解释的过程缓慢且手动，限制了其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的应用。

Method: 引入自动评估方法、专用数据集，并微调1B和8B模型用于生成NSM解释。

Result: 1B和8B模型在生成准确且可跨语言翻译的解释上表现优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs在通用语义表示中的应用开辟了新途径，为语义分析和翻译等领域提供了新可能性。

Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a
universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have
been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to
this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using
these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These
paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally
been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using
large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce
automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation,
and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in
producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step
toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new
possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体框架未能充分利用过去经验进行改进，Retrospex旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在ScienceWorld、ALFWorld和Webshop环境中，Retrospex表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Retrospex通过有效利用过去经验，显著提升了LLM智能体的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and commonsense
reasoning capabilities, making them valuable for creating powerful agents.
However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences
for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called
Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in
depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate
experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action
likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline
''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action
rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values
for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate
Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its
advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.

Motivation: 通用大语言模型在古典中文等特定领域表现不佳，需要开发专门模型以提升效果。

Method: 设计了AI Taiyan模型，通过合理的模型设计、数据处理、基础训练和微调，仅用18亿参数实现了优异表现。

Result: 在古典中文标点、典故识别、词义解释和古今翻译等任务中，AI Taiyan优于通用模型和传统领域模型，接近或超越人类基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为高效构建领域专用大语言模型提供了参考，并探讨了其在古籍整理、词典编辑等领域的应用。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models demonstrate notable capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, achieving results that are comparable
to, or even surpass, human performance in many language information processing
tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains,
e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and
fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately
incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study
developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for
understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a
reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and
fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion
parameters. In key tasks related to Classical Chinese information processing
such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings,
and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear
advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific
traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines.
This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of
specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper
discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of
ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case
studies.

Result: BELLE在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，且在复杂场景中更具成本效益。

Conclusion: BELLE通过分层多代理辩论和操作符匹配，有效解决了多跳问答问题，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages
and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous
works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling
perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question
types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop
QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types
of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step,
Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of
multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of
methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to
address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between
question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an
''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes
multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined
''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the
debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative
debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow
debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines
in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher
cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Model (CoM)的新学习范式，通过将因果关系嵌入隐藏状态链式结构，提升模型训练效率和部署灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在训练和推理时缺乏灵活性，难以动态扩展或调整模型规模。

Method: 引入Chain-of-Representation (CoR)概念，将隐藏状态分解为多个子表示链，每层仅依赖前序链。基于此设计了Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM)和CoLM-Air（共享KV机制）。

Result: CoLM系列在性能上与标准Transformer相当，同时支持动态扩展和多规模推理。

Conclusion: CoM为语言模型构建提供了新思路，兼具高效训练和灵活部署的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model
(CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of
each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in
model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the
concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at
each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at
the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output
representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input
representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can
progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the
previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes
for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this
principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the
idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we
further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes
all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.
This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM
switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate
our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,
while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling
to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for
elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code
will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.

Motivation: 现有方法在压缩长链式思维（CoT）时对所有思维进行均等压缩，限制了推理的简洁性和有效性。因此，研究旨在通过区分思维的重要性来提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中实现了与现有方法相当的性能，同时减少了80%的token长度。

Conclusion: Long⊗Short框架显著提升了LLMs的推理效率，为长链式思维的压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is
an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its
promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a
long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first
investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their
effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic
long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we
propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an
efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve
the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important
thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining
thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start
data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles,
respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn
reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration
between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our
method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance
compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while
reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and
GPQA Diamond benchmarks. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Detecting deviant language such as sexism, or nuanced language such as
metaphors or sarcasm, is crucial for enhancing the safety, clarity, and
interpretation of online social discourse. While existing classifiers deliver
strong results on these tasks, they often come with significant computational
cost and high data demands. In this work, we propose \textbf{Cla}ss
\textbf{D}istillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core
challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse
and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss
function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on
Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized
for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks -- sexism,
metaphor, and sarcasm -- ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with
smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves
performance comparable to several large language models (LLMs). These results
demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding
tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous
background.

Conclusion: MCD为LLMs在多语言环境下的安全性提供了有效解决方案，未来可进一步扩展其应用范围。

Abstract: The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a
prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM
safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented
languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models.
Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the
safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to
enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation
between various attack features across different languages and propose
Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that
optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate
multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages:
First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple
languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while
minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety
misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the
effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly
used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess
various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in
underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability
of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in
safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting
strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled the vision of
automated scientific discovery, often called AI Co-Scientists. To date, prior
work casts these systems as generative co-authors responsible for crafting
hypotheses, synthesizing code, or drafting manuscripts. In this work, we
explore a complementary application: using LLMs as verifiers to automate the
\textbf{academic verification of scientific manuscripts}. To that end, we
introduce SPOT, a dataset of 83 published papers paired with 91 errors
significant enough to prompt errata or retraction, cross-validated with actual
authors and human annotators. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on SPOT, we find
that none surpasses 21.1\% recall or 6.1\% precision (o3 achieves the best
scores, with all others near zero). Furthermore, confidence estimates are
uniformly low, and across eight independent runs, models rarely rediscover the
same errors, undermining their reliability. Finally, qualitative analysis with
domain experts reveals that even the strongest models make mistakes resembling
student-level misconceptions derived from misunderstandings. These findings
highlight the substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the
requirements for dependable AI-assisted academic verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NAMET是一种通过引入噪声改进大规模知识编辑效果的方法，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法在大规模编辑场景下效果下降，主要由于知识项之间的嵌入冲突。

Method: NAMET通过在MEMIT中引入噪声来提取记忆，方法简单但有效。

Result: 在六个LLM和三个数据集上的实验表明，NAMET在编辑数千条事实时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NAMET通过噪声感知机制显著提升了大规模知识编辑的可靠性。

Abstract: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in
large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches
degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with
practical metrics or in context-rich settings. We attribute these failures to
embedding collisions among knowledge items, which undermine editing reliability
at scale. To address this, we propose NAMET (Noise-aware Model Editing in
Transformers), a simple yet effective method that introduces noise during
memory extraction via a one-line modification to MEMIT. Extensive experiments
across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that NAMET consistently
outperforms existing methods when editing thousands of facts.

TL;DR: AutoMedEval是一个开源的自动评估模型，专门用于评估医学领域大语言模型的问答能力，旨在减少对人类评估的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如F1和ROUGE）忽视了医学术语的重要性，而人工评估成本高且可能不准确。现有基于LLM的评估方法在医学领域适用性有限。

Method: 提出AutoMedEval，采用分层训练方法（课程指令调整和迭代知识内省机制），在有限指令数据下获得专业医学评估能力。

Result: AutoMedEval在人类评估中表现优于其他基线模型，与人类判断相关性更高。

Conclusion: AutoMedEval为医学LLM评估提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，显著减少了对人工评估的依赖。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain,
there is increasing demand for improved evaluation techniques to assess their
capabilities. However, traditional metrics like F1 and ROUGE, which rely on
token overlaps to measure quality, significantly overlook the importance of
medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can
be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human
expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on
LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary
nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present
AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters
specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of
medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality
of responses produced by diverse models, aspiring to significantly reduce the
dependence on human evaluation. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
training method involving curriculum instruction tuning and an iterative
knowledge introspection mechanism, enabling AutoMedEval to acquire professional
medical assessment capabilities with limited instructional data. Human
evaluations indicate that AutoMedEval surpasses other baselines in terms of
correlation with human judgments.

Result: Mobile-Bench-v2成功评估了多种移动代理在多路径任务、噪声环境和主动交互中的能力。

Conclusion: Mobile-Bench-v2为移动代理提供了一个更接近真实场景的评估基准，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to
interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily
tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable
reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks
evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast
to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally,
both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise
or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full
instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we
use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic
and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a
common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's
ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split
based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to
formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split
with preset Q\&A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive
interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the
single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2,
as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的自适应规划框架（RLAP），用于优化大语言模型（LLM）在多步自然语言处理（NLP）任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多步NLP任务中忽略了实例的语言特征，仅依赖LLM的固有规划能力，导致结果不佳。

Method: 将NLP任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），利用轻量级Actor模型通过强化学习估计状态和动作序列的Q值，动态调整子任务顺序。

Result: 在三种不同类型的NLP任务和多个数据集上的实验验证了RLAP的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RLAP通过结合语言特征和强化学习，显著提升了LLM在多步NLP任务中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of
large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs
to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task
instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt
multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances'
linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to
evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in
suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this
paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework
(RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a
lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language
sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning.
Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence
in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the
LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply
RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on
multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: ReQAP为混合数据源上的问答提供了一种轻量级且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Question answering over mixed sources, like text and tables, has been
advanced by verbalizing all contents and encoding it with a language model. A
prominent case of such heterogeneous data is personal information: user devices
log vast amounts of data every day, such as calendar entries, workout
statistics, shopping records, streaming history, and more. Information needs
range from simple look-ups to queries of analytical nature. The challenge is to
provide humans with convenient access with small footprint, so that all
personal data stays on the user devices. We present ReQAP, a novel method that
creates an executable operator tree for a given question, via recursive
decomposition. Operators are designed to enable seamless integration of
structured and unstructured sources, and the execution of the operator tree
yields a traceable answer. We further release the PerQA benchmark, with
persona-based data and questions, covering a diverse spectrum of realistic user
needs.

Conclusion: 该方法通过逻辑推理优化检索，显著提升了性能并降低了资源消耗，为长上下文任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural
language processing, but their limited ability to retain long-term context
constrains performance on document-level or multi-turn tasks.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by retrieving relevant
information from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems often rely
on embedding-based retrieval trained on corpus-level semantic similarity, which
can lead to retrieving content that is semantically similar in form but
misaligned with the question's true intent. Furthermore, recent RAG variants
construct graph- or hierarchy-based structures to improve retrieval accuracy,
resulting in significant computation and storage overhead. In this paper, we
propose an embedding-free retrieval framework. Our method leverages the logical
inferencing ability of LLMs in retrieval using iterative search space
refinement guided by our novel importance measure and extend our retrieval
results with logically related information without explicit graph construction.
Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks, including NovelQA and Marathon, show
that our approach outperforms strong baselines while reducing storage and
runtime by over an order of magnitude.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖数据驱动，但忽视了子上下文的重要性，导致SFT效果不佳。

Method: 提出MISO框架，将顺序指令拆分为并行子上下文，并引入混合上下文范式，优化SFT效果。

Result: 实验证明MISO在复杂指令跟随任务中表现优越，且训练效率高。

Conclusion: MISO是一种有效的LLM微调方法，特别适用于复杂指令场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in handling
natural language tasks; however, they may struggle to consistently follow
complex instructions including those involve multiple constraints.
Post-training LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to
improve their ability to follow instructions. In addressing complex instruction
following, existing efforts primarily focus on data-driven methods that
synthesize complex instruction-output pairs for SFT. However, insufficient
attention allocated to crucial sub-contexts may reduce the effectiveness of
SFT. In this work, we propose transforming sequentially structured input
instruction into multiple parallel instructions containing subcontexts. To
support processing this multi-input, we propose MISO (Multi-Input
Single-Output), an extension to currently dominant decoder-only
transformer-based LLMs. MISO introduces a mixture-of-contexts paradigm that
jointly considers the overall instruction-output alignment and the influence of
individual sub-contexts to enhance SFT effectiveness. We apply MISO fine-tuning
to complex instructionfollowing datasets and evaluate it with standard LLM
inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MISO as a
fine-tuning method for LLMs, both in terms of effectiveness in complex
instruction-following scenarios and its potential for training efficiency.

Motivation: 探索语言模型通过自我校正提升性能的底层机制，特别是提示如何影响隐藏状态和输出分布。

Method: 提出一种数学框架描述自我校正，并通过实验验证提示诱导的线性表示对输出分布的影响。

Result: 实验显示，自我校正提示显著增强了语言模型对潜在概念的识别能力，特别是在文本去毒任务中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自我校正的底层机制，为解释提示如何影响模型行为提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We provide an explanation for the performance gains of intrinsic
self-correction, a process where a language model iteratively refines its
outputs without external feedback. More precisely, we investigate how prompting
induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output
distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear
span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based
on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a
mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result
for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text
detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner
products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most
toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic
tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts
enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our
analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by
characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code
is available.

Motivation: 在资源受限和复杂查询（具有嵌套结构和依赖关系）的情况下，RAG系统中的搜索意图识别仍然是一个挑战。

Method: QCompiler设计了一个最小但足够的BNF语法$G[q]$来形式化复杂查询，并包括查询表达式翻译器、词法语法解析器和递归下降处理器，将查询编译为AST。

Result: 通过子查询的原子性，QCompiler显著提高了RAG系统处理复杂查询的能力，实现了更精确的文档检索和响应生成。

Conclusion: QCompiler通过结合神经符号方法，为RAG系统中的复杂查询意图识别提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise recognition of search intent in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems remains a challenging goal, especially under resource constraints and
for complex queries with nested structures and dependencies. This paper
presents QCompiler, a neuro-symbolic framework inspired by linguistic grammar
rules and compiler design, to bridge this gap. It theoretically designs a
minimal yet sufficient Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar $G[q]$ to formalize
complex queries. Unlike previous methods, this grammar maintains completeness
while minimizing redundancy. Based on this, QCompiler includes a Query
Expression Translator, a Lexical Syntax Parser, and a Recursive Descent
Processor to compile queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for execution.
The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise
document retrieval and response generation, significantly improving the RAG
system's ability to address complex queries.

Motivation: 图表编辑是一项复杂任务，需要模型具备图表理解、复杂推理和精确意图解析能力，但目前缺乏全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出ChartEdit基准，包含1,405条编辑指令和233个真实图表，通过代码和图表两个层面评估10种主流MLLMs。

Result: 大规模模型能生成部分匹配参考图像的代码，但精确编辑能力有限（SOTA模型得分仅59.96）；小规模模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 图表编辑任务仍具挑战性，需进一步研究提升模型性能。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating
chart rendering code, chart editing presents a greater challenge. This
difficulty stems from its nature as a labor-intensive task for humans that also
demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding, complex reasoning, and precise
intent interpretation. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities,
current assessments typically rely on limited case studies rather than robust
evaluation methodologies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive
evaluation framework. In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality
benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises $1,405$
diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, with each
instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for
accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream
MLLMs across two types of experiments, assessing them at both the code and
chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to
produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their
ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains
limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$,
highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast,
small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following
editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need
for further development in this area. Code is available at

Conclusion: 多属性条件能显著提升反仇恨言论生成系统的效果。

Abstract: Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online.
Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on
specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering
multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective
responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with
Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the
effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically
optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase.
Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference
optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we
extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with
emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix
optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive
evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent
conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L,
respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further
substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced
relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work
underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the
efficacy of counterspeech generation systems.

others. A text can contain either single or multiple targets. Multiple
annotators are involved in the data annotation task. We calculated the
inter-annotator agreement, which was reported to be 0.86 for offensive content
and 0.71 for multiple hate speech targets. Finally, we evaluated the data
annotation task by employing a different transformers-based model in which
AraBERTv2 outperformed with a micro-F1 score of 0.7865 and an accuracy of

Abstract: Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large
language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed
to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader
application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced
its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization
mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a
systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate
internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios.
Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and
investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level.
Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization
process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement,
knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We
further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of
knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method,
knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification
associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively
deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on
one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles
for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge
formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and
reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前论点关系过于基础，难以捕捉复杂论点结构，尤其是在真实场景中。

Method: 提出14种细粒度关系类型，从垂直和水平维度捕捉论点组件的复杂互动，并在三个任务（论点组件检测、关系预测和自动作文评分）上进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明细粒度论点标注对论点写作质量评估至关重要，并鼓励多维论点分析。

Conclusion: 细粒度关系类型和多维分析能更全面地理解论点结构，提升论点写作质量评估。

Abstract: Argument mining has garnered increasing attention over the years, with the
recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) further propelling this
trend. However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and
foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information,
particularly when it comes to representing complex argument structures in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose 14 fine-grained
relation types from both vertical and horizontal dimensions, thereby capturing
the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough
understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive
experiments on three tasks: argument component detection, relation prediction,
and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing
quality on argument component detection and relation prediction, as well as the
connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The
findings highlight the importance of fine-grained argumentative annotations for
argumentative writing quality assessment and encourage multi-dimensional
argument analysis.

### [45] [MoL for LLMs: Dual-Loss Optimization to Enhance Domain Expertise While Preserving General Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12043)
*Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Qianchun Lu,Siyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mixture of Losses (MoL)的新框架，通过解耦领域特定和通用语料的优化目标，解决了领域特定应用中LLM的幻觉和准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在通用任务中表现良好，但在领域特定应用中存在幻觉和准确性限制。CPT方法面临领域偏差数据损害通用语言能力和语料混合比例不当的问题。

Method: 提出MoL框架，对领域数据使用交叉熵损失（CE）确保知识获取，对通用语料使用KL散度对齐基础模型能力，避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，1:1的领域与通用语料比例最优，无需大量调参。模型在Math-500和AIME25基准上分别取得27.9%和83.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MoL框架有效平衡了领域适应和通用能力，显著优于传统CPT方法。

Abstract: Although LLMs perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications
suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. CPT approaches encounter
two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and
(2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address
these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples
optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically,
cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain data to ensure knowledge
acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus
training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss
architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise,
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1
domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting
without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments.
Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared
to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general
language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500
benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement
on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Vinod Raman,Hilal Asi,Satyen Kale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示自适应的Best-of-N对齐策略，通过两阶段算法更高效地分配推理计算资源，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时对齐方法（如Best-of-N采样）虽然简单有效，但计算成本高，且未考虑不同提示的对齐难度差异。

Method: 开发了一种两阶段算法：第一阶段通过小预算探索估计每个提示的奖励分布，第二阶段根据估计自适应分配剩余预算。

Result: 在AlpacaEval数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略在相同推理预算下优于均匀分配，且在更大推理预算和批量增长时表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应策略简单实用，兼容性强，显著提升了计算效率，为语言模型对齐提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling,
offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward
preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be
computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts
without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we
propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates
inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we
develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the
reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a
second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates.
Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM/RM combination.
Empirical results on the AlpacaEval dataset for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different
batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy consistently outperforms the
uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, our experiments
show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations
with 20% larger inference budgets and even improves in performance as the batch
size grows.

gender-related harmful behaviors exhibited by LLMs. We release GenderBench as
an open-source and extensible library to improve the reproducibility and
robustness of benchmarking across the field. We also publish our evaluation of

that LLMs struggle with stereotypical reasoning, equitable gender
representation in generated texts, and occasionally also with discriminatory
behavior in high-stakes scenarios, such as hiring.

Result: 实验显示SAGE在多种LLM上平均防御成功率达99%，同时保持通用任务的实用性。

Conclusion: SAGE为未来LLM的安全意识和生成行为一致性提供了贡献，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across
various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks.
In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at
detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly
processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE (Self-Aware
Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs'
strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety
generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative
Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience
against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and
robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes
and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against
numerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on
general benchmarks. We further conduct mechanistic interpretability analysis
through hidden states and attention distributions, revealing the underlying
mechanisms of this detection-generation discrepancy. Our work thus contributes
to developing future LLMs with coherent safety awareness and generation
behavior. Our code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SAGE.

Motivation: 探索形态生产力的认知计算基础和历时变化，揭示语言模式的可推广性和个体语言使用的动态性。

Method: 使用判别词典模型（DLM）分析芬兰语、马来语和英语的形态模式，并通过托马斯·曼的阅读和写作数据研究历时变化。

Result: DLM发现词缀与语义中心点关联，托马斯·曼的新词产出率极低，输入中的新词远多于输出。

Conclusion: 形态生产力与形式-意义系统性和个体语言输入输出动态相关，DLM和历时分析为语言研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this study, we approach morphological productivity from two perspectives:
a cognitive-computational perspective, and a diachronic perspective zooming in
on an actual speaker, Thomas Mann. For developing the first perspective, we
make use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the
discriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and
meaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered
words, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between
the form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning
would be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but
there is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test
data. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English
compounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a
computational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional
and word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to
associate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of
the words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study
how the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over
time. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have
read, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived
words is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his
output. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word
with a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of
all derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of
using speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.

Motivation: 探究不同任务提示方式是否导致相似的任务表征，以提升模型的可解释性和控制能力。

Method: 通过函数向量提取任务表征，并将其推广到短文本指令提示，提取指令函数向量以提高零样本任务准确性。

Result: 发现演示和指令的函数向量利用不同模型组件，任务表征并非共通，而是部分重叠的不同机制。

Conclusion: 支持结合文本指令和任务演示的实践，但提示形式统一监控任务推理存在挑战，需进一步研究LLM任务推理机制。

Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting
language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks
elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An
improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer
interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through
function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task
representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task
presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully
extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We
find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors
leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate
their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different
task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit
different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support
to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations,
imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation
forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large

relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation
of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive
experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging
from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging
checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant
performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing
behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and
significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging
strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying
mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive
experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical
pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

Result: 发现LLMs的效果呈现双峰分布，个性化提示方法显著优于标准提示技术。

Conclusion: 个性化提示方法能部分解决双峰分布问题，提升LLMs在混淆作者身份中的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in
obfuscating authorship by paraphrasing and altering writing styles. Rather than
adopting a holistic approach that evaluates performance across the entire
dataset, we focus on user-wise performance to analyze how obfuscation
effectiveness varies across individual authors. While LLMs are generally
effective, we observe a bimodal distribution of efficacy, with performance
varying significantly across users. To address this, we propose a personalized
prompting method that outperforms standard prompting techniques and partially
mitigates the bimodality issue.

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理和生成AI中表现出色，但其预测中的偏见问题阻碍了其在伦理敏感和负责任决策任务中的应用。

Method: 通过修改句子中的特定属性生成多个变体，评估预测行为与原句的差异，仅需前向传递，无需训练或微调。

Result: 在Llama系列模型上实验表明，该方法显著改善了公平性指标，特别是在减少不同种族群体间的差异上，最高提升27个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法无需调整参数或修改训练数据，显著提升了LLM生成结果的公平性和可靠性，为LLMs在伦理敏感任务中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language
processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern
society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e.,
predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their
application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible
decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and
practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and
trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given
sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding
prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence.
The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit
notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous
approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time
adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior
knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on
the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in
how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically,
using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27
percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness,
equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or
training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical
scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling
the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible
decision-making.

Abstract: Content moderation research has recently made significant advances, but still
fails to serve the majority of the world's languages due to the lack of
resources, leaving millions of vulnerable users to online hostility. This work
presents a large-scale human-annotated multi-task benchmark dataset for abusive
language detection in Tigrinya social media with joint annotations for three
tasks: abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification. The dataset comprises
13,717 YouTube comments annotated by nine native speakers, collected from 7,373
videos with a total of over 1.2 billion views across 51 channels. We developed
an iterative term clustering approach for effective data selection. Recognizing
that around 64% of Tigrinya social media content uses Romanized
transliterations rather than native Ge'ez script, our dataset accommodates both
writing systems to reflect actual language use. We establish strong baselines
across the tasks in the benchmark, while leaving significant challenges for
future contributions. Our experiments reveal that small, specialized multi-task
models outperform the current frontier models in the low-resource setting,
achieving up to 86% accuracy (+7 points) in abusiveness detection. We make the
resources publicly available to promote research on online safety.

Motivation: 探讨社会经济地位如何影响人们与语言技术的互动，揭示潜在的数字鸿沟问题。

Method: 调查了1000名来自不同SES背景的个体，收集了6482条与LLM的互动提示，分析使用频率、任务类型、互动风格和话题。

Result: 高SES群体使用更抽象的语言和简洁请求，话题涉及“包容性”和“旅行”；低SES群体更倾向于拟人化表达和具体语言。

Conclusion: 语言技术的开发需考虑SES差异，以减少数字鸿沟并满足不同群体的语言需求。

Abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with
each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language
Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between
SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and
synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and
collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find
systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e.,
frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails
a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like
'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher
anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more
concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language
technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic
differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These
differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language
technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic
factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.

Conclusion: 研究强调了本地化NLP工具的重要性，为土耳其语情感分析提供了实用解决方案，并推动了计算社会科学的发展。

Abstract: Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) play a crucial role in
shaping public discourse and societal norms. This study examines the term
Sessiz Istila (Silent Invasion) on Turkish social media, highlighting the rise
of anti-refugee sentiment amidst the Syrian refugee influx. Using BERTurk and
the TREMO dataset, we developed an advanced Emotion Recognition Model (ERM)
tailored for Turkish, achieving 92.62% accuracy in categorizing emotions such
as happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise. By applying this
model to large-scale X data, the study uncovers emotional nuances in Turkish
discourse, contributing to computational social science by advancing sentiment
analysis in underrepresented languages and enhancing our understanding of
global digital discourse and the unique linguistic challenges of Turkish. The
findings underscore the transformative potential of localized NLP tools, with
our ERM model offering practical applications for real-time sentiment analysis
in Turkish-language contexts. By addressing critical areas, including
marketing, public relations, and crisis management, these models facilitate
improved decision-making through timely and accurate sentiment tracking. This
highlights the significance of advancing research that accounts for regional

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型真实性的机制，为提升其可信度和可靠性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows,
language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited
understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these
models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a
method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We
show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a
subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales
validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of
truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models.
The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior
findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the
activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades
performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the
truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer
novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models
and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and
reliability.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
sectors has highlighted the need for empirical research to understand their
biases, thought patterns, and societal implications to ensure ethical and
effective use. In this study, we propose a novel framework for evaluating LLMs,
focusing on uncovering their ideological biases through a quantitative analysis
of 436 binary-choice questions, many of which have no definitive answer. By
applying our framework to ChatGPT and Gemini, findings revealed that while LLMs
generally maintain consistent opinions on many topics, their ideologies differ
across models and languages. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits a tendency to change
their opinion to match the questioner's opinion. Both models also exhibited
problematic biases, unethical or unfair claims, which might have negative
societal impacts. These results underscore the importance of addressing both
ideological and ethical considerations when evaluating LLMs. The proposed
framework offers a flexible, quantitative method for assessing LLM behavior,
providing valuable insights for the development of more socially aligned AI

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能够准确模拟人类句子处理，以及模型规模对预测能力的影响。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLM向量，并控制预测变量数量，评估模型对人类阅读时间和脑成像数据的预测能力。

Result: 结果显示，模型规模增大到一定程度后，预测能力反而下降，表明LLMs与人类句子处理存在显著不匹配。

Conclusion: LLMs的不足可能源于其与人类句子处理的根本差异，且这种差异随模型规模增大而加剧。

Abstract: The impressive linguistic abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
recommended them as models of human sentence processing, with some conjecturing
a positive 'quality-power' relationship (Wilcox et al., 2023), in which
language models' (LMs') fit to psychometric data continues to improve as their
ability to predict words in context increases. This is important because it
suggests that elements of LLM architecture, such as veridical attention to
context and a unique objective of predicting upcoming words, reflect the
architecture of the human sentence processing faculty, and that any
inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be
attributed to insufficient model complexity, which recedes as larger models
become available. Recent studies (Oh and Schuler, 2023) have shown this scaling
inverts after a point, as LMs become excessively large and accurate, when word
prediction probability (as information-theoretic surprisal) is used as a
predictor. Other studies propose the use of entire vectors from differently
sized LLMs, still showing positive scaling (Schrimpf et al., 2021), casting
doubt on the value of surprisal as a predictor, but do not control for the
larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LMs. This study evaluates
LLM scaling using entire LLM vectors, while controlling for the larger number
of predictors in vectors from larger LLMs. Results show that inverse scaling
obtains, suggesting that inadequacies in predicting human reading time and
brain imaging data may be due to substantial misalignment between LLMs and
human sentence processing, which worsens as larger models are used.

TL;DR: LLM-as-a-Judge在多语言评估中表现不一致，平均Fleiss' Kappa约为0.3，低资源语言表现更差。训练数据多语言性或模型规模无法直接提升一致性。提出集成策略以改善实际应用中的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言评估中的可靠性，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 评估五个不同模型家族的模型在25种语言的五项任务中的表现，分析影响因素。

Result: LLMs在多语言评估中表现不一致，低资源语言表现较差，训练数据或模型规模无法直接提升一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs目前不可靠用于多语言预测评估，提出的集成策略可改善一致性。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a popular evaluation strategy, where advanced
large language models assess generation results in alignment with human
instructions. While these models serve as a promising alternative to human
annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To
bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual
LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model
families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal
that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages,
with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing
even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various
influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across
languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages.
Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing
model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that
LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally
propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual
judge in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模增长，传统数据选择方法耗时且资源密集，或依赖启发式方法未能充分利用模型预测能力。

Method: 提出Data Whisperer，利用少样本上下文学习直接从目标模型中提取信息，无需额外训练。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上，仅用10%数据即优于完整GSM8K数据集，性能提升3.1分，速度提升7.4倍。

Conclusion: Data Whisperer是一种高效、无需训练的数据选择方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential
for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting
optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and
computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require
fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the
model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data
Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages
few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive
evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse
tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance
compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just
10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement
and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.

TL;DR: GMSA是一种基于编码器-解码器架构的上下文压缩框架，通过减少输入序列长度和冗余信息，解决了大语言模型在长上下文场景中的计算效率低和信息冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文场景中面临计算效率低和信息冗余的挑战，需要一种有效的压缩方法。

Method: GMSA包含两个关键组件：组合并和层语义对齐（LSA），通过自动编码器训练学习软标记，并采用知识提取微调（KEFT）适应下游任务。

Result: GMSA在上下文恢复中显著优于传统压缩方法，并在下游问答任务中实现约2倍的端到端推理加速，性能优于原始输入提示和其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: GMSA通过上下文压缩显著提升了大语言模型在长上下文场景中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a
variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, when applied to
long-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational
efficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a
context compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which
addresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant
information. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer
Semantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently
extract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on
the other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level
primary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different
layers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain
complete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to
downstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract
knowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly
sampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this
condition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression
paradigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly
faster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream
question-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in
end-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and
various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: 提出UniCuCo模型，通过StratNet学习最优剪枝策略，解决现有LLM剪枝方法在多请求场景下的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法处理多请求时效率低，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 引入StratNet，利用高斯过程近似非可微剪枝过程的梯度，实现模型更新。

Result: UniCuCo处理64个请求时比基线快28倍，且精度相当。

Conclusion: UniCuCo显著提升了多请求场景下的剪枝效率，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving
high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these
methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's
compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number
of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple
simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model
for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that
learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The
challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of
evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning
process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To
overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the
evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable,
we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning
process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that
UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while
maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要采用定量方法分析LLMs在学术写作中的使用，但缺乏对其语言特征影响的系统研究。

Method: 通过对arXiv数据集中的摘要进行语言特征分析，包括词汇复杂性、句法复杂性、连贯性、可读性和情感。

Result: 研究发现LLMs导致摘要中偏好词汇增加、词汇复杂性提高但句法复杂性降低，同时连贯性和可读性显著下降。

Conclusion: LLMs对学术写作风格产生显著影响，尤其是英语水平较低的学者和计算机科学领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have prompted academic
concerns about their impact on academic writing. Existing studies have
primarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative
approaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses.
However, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the
linguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we
conducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last
decade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as
the frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity,
cohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant
increase in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the
widespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an
increase in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease
in syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and
simplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and
readability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are
becoming more difficult to read. Moreover, our analysis reveals that scholars
with weaker English proficiency were more likely to use the LLMs for academic
writing, and focused on improving the overall logic and fluency of the
abstracts. Finally, at discipline level, we found that scholars in Computer
Science showed more pronounced changes in writing style, while the changes in
Mathematics were minimal.

Motivation: 少样本关系抽取（FSRE）因标注数据稀缺和现有模型泛化能力有限而具有挑战性。LLMs虽通过上下文学习展现潜力，但其通用训练目标在任务特定关系抽取中表现不佳。

Method: TKRE提出两阶段知识引导预训练框架：1）利用LLMs生成解释驱动知识和模式约束合成数据；2）结合掩码跨度语言建模（MSLM）和跨度级对比学习（SCL）的两阶段预训练策略。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，TKRE在FSRE任务中实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: TKRE有效解决了FSRE问题，并在低资源场景中展现出广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the
scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of
existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose
training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific
relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage
Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that
synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models,
bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two
key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge
and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity;
and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language
Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational
reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to
effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource
scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的规模扩大和实际应用增加，其对敏感和PII数据的记忆带来了隐私风险。现有研究缺乏全面、真实且符合伦理的数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 通过构建内部一致的多属性人类配置文件，结合零样本提示和OpenAI o3-mini生成多样化的内容类型（如维基文章、社交媒体帖子等），嵌入真实的PII和敏感信息。

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上验证了PANORAMA的实用性，发现PII记忆率随数据重复率增加而上升，且不同内容类型的记忆风险存在差异。

Conclusion: PANORAMA为隐私风险评估、模型审计和隐私保护LLM的开发提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The memorization of sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII)
by large language models (LLMs) poses growing privacy risks as models scale and
are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Existing efforts to study
sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are
hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced
datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We
introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online
Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic
corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to
closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive
data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation
pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute
human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics
such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a
combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse
content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum
discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each
embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive
information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B
model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and
measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with
repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's
ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code
are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk
assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LMs生成的概率分布的表达能力及其作为概率分布提出者的挑战。

Result: 低或高熵分布更容易近似；含异常标记的分布更易近似；LM生成的目标分布比随机目标更易近似。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LMs的表达能力及其在概率分布提出方面的局限性。

Abstract: Autoregressive neural language models (LMs) generate a probability
distribution over tokens at each time step given a prompt. In this work, we
attempt to systematically understand the probability distributions that LMs can
produce, showing that some distributions are significantly harder to elicit
than others. Specifically, for any target next-token distribution over the
vocabulary, we attempt to find a prompt that induces the LM to output a
distribution as close as possible to the target, using either soft or hard
gradient-based prompt tuning. We find that (1) in general, distributions with
very low or very high entropy are easier to approximate than those with
moderate entropy; (2) among distributions with the same entropy, those
containing ''outlier tokens'' are easier to approximate; (3) target
distributions generated by LMs -- even LMs with different tokenizers -- are
easier to approximate than randomly chosen targets. These results offer
insights into the expressiveness of LMs and the challenges of using them as
probability distribution proposers.

Result: 实验表明EQUAL降低计算成本5-10倍，并在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Mistral-7B上提升准确率2.5%。

Conclusion: EQUAL是一种高效且可扩展的数据提取框架，适用于提升指令调优性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs),
but it heavily relies on high-quality training data. Recently, LLMs have been
used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs.
However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be
similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from
web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to
retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this
faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is
prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to
the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these
issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework
that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair
extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document
corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a
multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to
contain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces
computational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on
AutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL
reduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on
LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B

Conclusion: Teach2Eval为LLMs评估提供了一种新颖、多维且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the development
of effective evaluation methods. Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific
metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited
scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval,
an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of
directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's
multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively.
By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable,
automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data
leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities
that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26
leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic
rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.

Conclusion: RATE-FT是一种有效且通用的幻觉检测方法，显著提升了开放域长文本生成中的准确性。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect information, remains a
significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in
open-domain long-form generation. Existing approaches for detecting
hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely
heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.
  In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination
detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal
states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient
for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual
and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing
approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with
fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we
introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an
auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of
hallucination detection. With extensive experiments and analysis using a
variety of model families & datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method, e.g., +3% over general fine-tuning methods on
LongFact.

Method: 提出了$(K, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit（K-MSHC）方法和Search-K-MSHC算法，用于识别关键注意力头电路。

Result: 在Gemma-9B模型上，发现语法任务主要利用早期层，算术验证任务表现出更分散的模式，而算术应用题在浅层和深层区域均有显著活动。不同任务之间存在非线性电路重叠模式。

Conclusion: 句法和数值能力源于专门化但部分可重用的注意力头电路，每个任务拥有专用的“超级头”且交叉任务重叠最小。

Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in
mid-sized language models ($\leq$10B parameters) remains a key challenge. We
introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC),
a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for
classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for
discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B,
we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic
verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct
task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early
layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep
regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern
across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where
different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of
importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic
and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly,
we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal
cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge
from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.

Result: 提出的方法在多个LLM上表现优于现有方法，Spearman相关性最高提升+0.1083。

Conclusion: 方言指导的框架有效提升了低资源语言机器翻译的评估效果，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages poses a
persistent challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of high quality
reference translations. This issue is further exacerbated in languages with
multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust
evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through
reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes
in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work,
we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation
using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating
Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct
Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary
gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We
further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and
design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple
LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along
with improvements across other evaluation settings. The dataset and the code

TL;DR: 该论文研究了闭源大语言模型（LLM）在多语言攻击场景下的脆弱性，提出了一个综合对抗框架，评估了包括GPT-4o在内的多种模型，发现Qwen-Max最易受攻击，而GPT-4o防御最强。中文提示的攻击成功率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究闭源LLM在多语言攻击下的表现，填补开源模型研究之外的空白，推动更鲁棒和包容的AI系统发展。

Method: 提出综合对抗框架，利用多样攻击技术评估闭源LLM，涵盖32种攻击类型和6类安全内容，生成38,400个响应，以攻击成功率（ASR）为指标。

Result: Qwen-Max最脆弱，GPT-4o防御最强；中文提示攻击成功率更高；新型Two-Sides攻击技术最有效。

Conclusion: 需加强语言感知对齐和跨语言防御，推动更鲁棒的AI系统发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various
domains, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt injections. While most
existing research on jailbreak attacks and hallucination phenomena has focused
primarily on open-source models, we investigate the frontier of closed-source
LLMs under multilingual attack scenarios. We present a first-of-its-kind
integrated adversarial framework that leverages diverse attack techniques to
systematically evaluate frontier proprietary solutions, including GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen-Max. Our evaluation spans six categories
of security contents in both English and Chinese, generating 38,400 responses
across 32 types of jailbreak attacks. Attack success rate (ASR) is utilized as
the quantitative metric to assess performance from three dimensions: prompt
design, model architecture, and language environment. Our findings suggest that
Qwen-Max is the most vulnerable, while GPT-4o shows the strongest defense.
Notably, prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English
counterparts, and our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most
effective across all models. This work highlights a dire need for
language-aware alignment and robust cross-lingual defenses in LLMs, and we hope
it will inspire researchers, developers, and policymakers toward more robust
and inclusive AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种迭代偏好学习（IPL）方法，通过构建CoaT-tree和思维级直接偏好优化（T-DPO）对，解决了现有方法在数据稀缺和中间推理步骤正确性上的不足，并在移动GUI任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理CoaT轨迹稀缺性和中间推理步骤正确性时存在不足，且依赖昂贵的注释。IPL旨在通过迭代学习和规则奖励解决这些问题。

Method: 提出IPL方法，包括构建CoaT-tree、规则奖励评分和T-DPO对生成，并引入三阶段指令演化以防止过拟合。

Result: MobileIPL在三个标准移动GUI任务基准测试中表现优于基线模型，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IPL方法有效提升了移动GUI代理的性能和泛化能力，为数据稀缺和推理正确性问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to
improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks.
However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness
and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly
employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the
correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive
process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address
the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that
constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using
rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct
Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up
supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction
evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real
mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding.
Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our
agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining
models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong
generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HBO的分层平衡优化方法，用于解决大语言模型（LLM）在多样化数据集微调中的数据不平衡和异质性问题。HBO通过全局和局部两级优化策略，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据集之间的全局平衡，而忽略了数据集内部的局部不平衡和异质性，限制了微调效果。

Method: HBO采用双层优化策略，包括全局Actor（平衡数据集间采样）和局部Actor（优化数据集内数据使用），并通过奖励函数指导优化。

Result: 在多种任务和多语言设置中，HBO显著优于现有基线方法，实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: HBO为LLM微调中的数据不平衡和异质性提供了全面解决方案，提升了多样化数据集上的训练效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets
poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods
often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the
imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits
their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a
novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during
fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset
(locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of
actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets
of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage
within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by
reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning
progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM
backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups.
Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving
significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that
both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage
during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of
data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective
training across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了WikiDYK，一个基于维基百科动态更新的知识注入基准，用于测试大语言模型的知识记忆能力，发现因果语言模型（CLMs）表现不如双向语言模型（BiLMs），并提出了一种模块化协作框架以提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）的知识记忆能力缺乏标准化和高质量的测试基准，因此需要一种动态更新的评估工具。

Method: 利用维基百科的“你知道吗...”条目构建WikiDYK基准，生成多样化的问题-答案对，并通过实验比较CLMs和BiLMs的表现，提出基于BiLMs的协作框架。

Result: CLMs的知识记忆能力比BiLMs低23%，而提出的协作框架将可靠性准确率提升了29.1%。

Conclusion: WikiDYK为评估LLMs知识记忆能力提供了动态基准，BiLMs表现更优，协作框架显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs), their knowledge
memorization capabilities remain underexplored, due to the lack of standardized
and high-quality test ground. In this paper, we introduce a novel, real-world
and large-scale knowledge injection benchmark that evolves continuously over
time without requiring human intervention. Specifically, we propose WikiDYK,
which leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's "Did
You Know..." entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia
editors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is
converted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats
from easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290
facts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future
updates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued
pre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern
LLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge
memorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs),
exhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the
smaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework
utilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate
with LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability
accuracy by up to 29.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExpertSteer利用外部专家模型生成引导向量，通过四步流程在推理过程中指导目标LLM，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模型自身生成引导向量，限制了效果和跨模型应用，需解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过自动编码器对齐表示维度，基于互信息分析选择干预层对，使用递归特征机生成引导向量，并在推理中应用。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ExpertSteer显著优于基线方法，且成本低。

Conclusion: ExpertSteer为LLM行为控制提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，支持跨模型知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various
tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a
significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control
the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations.
However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using
steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their
effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging
powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we
propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized
expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs.
ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM
through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions
with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying
intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating
steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and
finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to
selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct
comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four
distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly
outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.

Method: 使用现成的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，设计多轮提示，枚举条件并指导模型标记、引用和裁决推理步骤，辅以正则表达式后处理。

Result: 未进行微调或外部检索的情况下，排名第5，宏F1分数与更复杂的系统相当。

Conclusion: 分析了方法的优势与局限，并展望了未来在LLM结构化推理中的研究方向。

Abstract: We present Team asdfo123's submission to the LLMSR@XLLM25 shared task, which
evaluates large language models on producing fine-grained, controllable, and
interpretable reasoning processes. Systems must extract all problem conditions,
decompose a chain of thought into statement-evidence pairs, and verify the
logical validity of each pair. Leveraging only the off-the-shelf
Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we craft a concise few-shot, multi-turn prompt that
first enumerates all conditions and then guides the model to label, cite, and
adjudicate every reasoning step. A lightweight post-processor based on regular
expressions normalises spans and enforces the official JSON schema. Without
fine-tuning, external retrieval, or ensembling, our method ranks 5th overall,
achieving macro F1 scores on par with substantially more complex and
resource-consuming pipelines. We conclude by analysing the strengths and
limitations of our approach and outlining directions for future research in
structural reasoning with LLMs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: UniEdit是一个基于开放领域知识的统一基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的编辑效果，覆盖广泛的知识领域和编辑需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM编辑数据集局限于狭窄的知识领域，且编辑评估范围有限，未能全面反映编辑需求和编辑后的连锁效应。

Method: 通过从25个常见领域选择实体构建编辑样本，设计NMCS算法采样子图以评估编辑的连锁效应，并使用LLM将子图转换为自然语言文本。

Result: UniEdit基准在规模、全面性和多样性上得到验证，实验分析揭示了LLM在开放知识领域编辑中的优缺点。

Conclusion: UniEdit为未来研究提供了有价值的基准和见解，推动了LLM编辑技术的发展。

Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language
models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently,
most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a
limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of
editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In
this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing
grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by
selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories,
utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge
graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address
the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood
Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given
knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we
employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural
language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity.
Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and
diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across
multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths
and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation
criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）会反映数据中的偏见，通过聚合响应可以缓解偏见，但简单平均会加剧偏见，而加权聚合和混合人群（LLM+人类）更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在性能优异的同时可能无意中放大训练数据中的偏见，需要探索有效的偏见缓解方法。

Method: 分析LLM对偏见诱导标题的响应，尝试通过聚合响应（简单平均、加权聚合）和混合人群（LLM+人类）来缓解偏见。

Result: 简单平均会加剧偏见，加权聚合和混合人群能更有效缓解偏见并提高准确性。

Conclusion: 加权聚合和混合人群是缓解LLM偏见的有效策略，结合LLM的准确性和人类的多样性可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Despite their performance, large language models (LLMs) can inadvertently
perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on. By analyzing LLM
responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror
human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating
bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging
responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd",
can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds.
In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively
leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and
improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs
(accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing
both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic
and gender-related contexts.

Motivation: 提示注入是大型语言模型的主要安全风险，现有防护模型在上下文感知环境中的效果未充分研究，且存在过度防御问题。

Method: 引入CAPTURE基准测试，利用少量域内示例评估攻击检测和过度防御倾向。

Result: 现有提示注入防护模型在对抗性案例中漏检率高，在良性场景中误报率高。

Conclusion: CAPTURE揭示了现有防护模型的关键局限性，需改进以平衡检测和防御能力。

Abstract: Prompt injection remains a major security risk for large language models.
However, the efficacy of existing guardrail models in context-aware settings
remains underexplored, as they often rely on static attack benchmarks.
Additionally, they have over-defense tendencies. We introduce CAPTURE, a novel

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于比较行为理论的方法，研究语言模型中数据与架构对偏见传播的影响，发现数据时间性、模型架构和偏见注入方式对偏见传播有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于语言模型偏见的研究多集中于数据质量，而忽略了模型架构和时间性数据的影响，且缺乏对偏见起源的系统性研究。

Method: 采用比较行为理论方法，结合n-gram语言模型和Transformer架构，分析数据、模型设计和时间动态对偏见传播的影响。

Result: 发现n-gram模型对上下文窗口大小敏感，Transformer架构更具鲁棒性；数据时间性显著影响偏见；不同架构对偏见注入的响应不同，某些偏见（如性取向）被放大。

Conclusion: 需从数据和模型维度全面追溯偏见起源，而非仅关注表象，以减少语言模型偏见的危害。

Abstract: Current research on bias in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
data quality, with significantly less attention paid to model architecture and
temporal influences of data. Even more critically, few studies systematically
investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in
comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between
training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language
modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we
evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias
propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to
context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate
architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data
significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond
differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual
orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become
ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing
bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms,
to mitigate harm.

TL;DR: SLOT是一种参数高效的测试时推理方法，通过少量优化步骤更新样本特定参数向量，提升语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳，SLOT旨在通过样本特定优化提升模型性能。

Method: SLOT在测试时进行少量优化步骤，更新轻量级样本特定参数向量，并将其添加到最终隐藏层前，通过缓存最后一层特征实现高效适配。

Result: 实验表明，SLOT在多个基准测试和模型上表现优异，例如Qwen2.5-7B在GSM8K上准确率提升8.6%，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B在GPQA上达到68.69%的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: SLOT通过样本特定优化显著提升了语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a
novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a
language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts.
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT
achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码框架依赖令牌级验证机制，导致接受长度不理想和候选令牌利用率低。

Method: 采用叶到根遍历方式验证整个令牌序列，保留可能被现有方法过早丢弃的有效子序列。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种大型语言模型和任务中均能提高接受长度和吞吐量。

Conclusion: Traversal Verification在保证无损推理的同时实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language
models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the
output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify
them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or
rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct
token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their
reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical
limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from
that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second,
current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by
layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes
should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative
candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative
decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm
through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the
entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves
potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing
methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained
through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model,
guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains.
Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks
show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput
over existing methods

importantly, to identify that the source of infringement is the ChatGPT. The
proposed method is tested with a benchmark dataset specifically created for
this task that incorporates real articles from BBC, incorporating a total of
2,224 articles across five different news categories, as well as 2,224

Method: 提出Table-R1方法，结合RE-SFT引导模型识别相关表格区域，并采用TARPO动态平衡区域准确性和答案正确性。

Result: Table-R1在多个基准数据集上平均提升14.36分，TARPO减少67.5%的响应令牌消耗。

Conclusion: Table-R1和TARPO显著提升了语言模型在表格推理中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured
row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective
comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential
in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT)
and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question
answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based
Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table
understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method
employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in
identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating
textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to
dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying
region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments
show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points
across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming
baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response
token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM
capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.

Result: 启用PSC后，困惑度随上下文窗口大小（16k至64k）的增加而显著降低。PSC具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PSC是一种简单有效的模块，能够显著提升现有方法在扩展RoPE上下文窗口时的性能，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach
and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a
lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based
on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set
of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a
challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the
exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift
Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by
existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing
methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted
extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate
that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase
as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our
approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of
models and tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/WNQzhu/PSC.

### [88] [Learning to Play Like Humans: A Framework for LLM Adaptation in Interactive Fiction Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12439)
*Jinming Zhang,Yunfei Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LPLH的认知启发框架，旨在通过结构化地图构建、动作学习和反馈驱动经验分析，使大型语言模型（LLMs）更接近人类玩家的叙事理解和决策行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在交互式小说游戏（IF游戏）中过于关注任务性能指标，而忽视了人类对叙事背景和游戏逻辑的理解。本文希望通过认知科学原理，使LLMs更接近人类玩家的行为。

Method: LPLH框架包含三个关键组件：结构化地图构建（捕捉空间与叙事关系）、动作学习（识别上下文相关命令）和反馈驱动经验分析（优化决策）。

Result: LPLH框架使LLMs在IF游戏中表现出更接近人类的叙事意图和常识约束的行为，超越了纯探索性策略。

Conclusion: LPLH将IF游戏挑战重新定义为LLMs的学习问题，为复杂文本环境中的上下文感知游戏玩法提供了新路径。

Abstract: Interactive Fiction games (IF games) are where players interact through
natural language commands. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence
agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying
decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance
metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic.
This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language
Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed
**L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three
key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative
relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands,
and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over
time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and
commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to
deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach
draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human
players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH
reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents,
offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自我提问提升大语言模型（LLM）理解能力的方法，并在计算机科学专利数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出概念理解能力，但其内部知识往往难以访问或评估，尤其是在需要精细语义区分的领域。

Method: 采用自我提问策略，让模型生成并回答问题，激活其潜在知识；同时结合外部科学文本检索。

Result: 自我提问显著提升了模型性能，尤其在技术概念理解上优于链式思维提示；发现小模型能为中模型生成更基础的问题。

Conclusion: 自我提问是一种实用机制，可自动提升LLM理解能力，并可作为诊断工具探究模型内外部知识的组织方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual
understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely
structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as
a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding,
particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic
distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new
benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized
by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark
centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between
closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting
LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background
knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These
self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal
knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts
further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and
lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that
chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though
self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of
technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller
models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned
questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do,
revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our
findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for
automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse
and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and
external knowledge are organized.

TL;DR: 论文研究了远程监督命名实体识别（DS-NER）的有效性和鲁棒性，通过对比不同远程标注方法及提出新的噪声评估框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法成本高，远程监督方法虽然便捷但存在噪声问题，目前对噪声分布的研究较少。

Method: 通过两种方式探索DS-NER：1）对比传统规则方法与基于大语言模型的标注方法；2）提出新框架，将噪声问题分为未标注实体问题（UEP）和噪声实体问题（NEP），并分别提供解决方案。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上验证，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种标注技术和数据源下表现优越，为DS-NER提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) has emerged as a cheap
and convenient alternative to traditional human annotation methods, enabling
the automatic generation of training data by aligning text with external
resources. Despite the many efforts in noise measurement methods, few works
focus on the latent noise distribution between different distant annotation
methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness and robustness of DS-NER by
two aspects: (1) distant annotation techniques, which encompasses both
traditional rule-based methods and the innovative large language model
supervision approach, and (2) noise assessment, for which we introduce a novel
framework. This framework addresses the challenges by distinctly categorizing
them into the unlabeled-entity problem (UEP) and the noisy-entity problem
(NEP), subsequently providing specialized solutions for each. Our proposed
method achieves significant improvements on eight real-world distant
supervision datasets originating from three different data sources and
involving four distinct annotation techniques, confirming its superiority over
current state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 将任务输出建模为背景和观点摘要，定义两种标准化摘要模式，并引入首个高质量人工标注基准和分层评估框架。评估了12种LLMs在结构化提示和自反思范式下的表现。

Result: 发现LLMs在背景摘要检索、生成和观点摘要整合方面表现不佳；即使表现最好的LLMs平均性能也不足69%；当前LLMs缺乏足够的自评估和自纠正能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在新任务中的表现仍有显著不足，尤其是在背景和观点摘要的整合及自评估能力方面。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of LLMs on a new task that
requires combining discussion with background knowledge for summarization. This
aims to address the limitation of outside observer confusion in existing
dialogue summarization systems due to their reliance solely on discussion
information. To achieve this, we model the task output as background and
opinion summaries and define two standardized summarization patterns. To
support assessment, we introduce the first benchmark comprising high-quality
samples consistently annotated by human experts and propose a novel
hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained, interpretable metrics. We
evaluate 12 LLMs under structured-prompt and self-reflection paradigms. Our
findings reveal: (1) LLMs struggle with background summary retrieval,
generation, and opinion summary integration. (2) Even top LLMs achieve less
than 69% average performance across both patterns. (3) Current LLMs lack
adequate self-evaluation and self-correction capabilities for this task.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法忽视历史推理路径的利用，且复杂语义可能导致检索不准确的路径。

Method: RTSoG将问题分解为子问题，使用奖励引导的SC-MCTS检索加权推理路径，并堆叠生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证有效性，GrailQA和WebQSP分别提升8.7%和7.0%。

Conclusion: RTSoG通过分解问题和优化路径检索，显著提升了KGQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) tasks, which aim to
find answers based on knowledge graphs (KGs) for natural language questions.
Existing LLMs-based KGQA methods typically follow the Graph Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (GraphRAG) paradigm, which first retrieves reasoning paths from the
large KGs, and then generates the answers based on them. However, these methods
emphasize the exploration of new optimal reasoning paths in KGs while ignoring
the exploitation of historical reasoning paths, which may lead to sub-optimal
reasoning paths. Additionally, the complex semantics contained in questions may
lead to the retrieval of inaccurate reasoning paths. To address these issues,
this paper proposes a novel and training-free framework for KGQA tasks called
Reward-guided Tree Search on Graph (RTSoG). RTSoG decomposes an original
question into a series of simpler and well-defined sub-questions to handle the
complex semantics. Then, a Self-Critic Monte Carlo Tree Search (SC-MCTS) guided
by a reward model is introduced to iteratively retrieve weighted reasoning
paths as contextual knowledge. Finally, it stacks the weighted reasoning paths
according to their weights to generate the final answers. Extensive experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RTSoG. Notably, it achieves
8.7\% and 7.0\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the
GrailQA and the WebQSP respectively.

Motivation: 现代语言模型上下文长度增加，需评估其在长文档中检索和处理信息的能力，现有基准缺乏系统性难度变化。

Method: 利用金融协议的结构化表示，生成多复杂度QA对，涵盖多跳检索、集合操作和答案多样性三个维度。

Result: 构建了20,139个QA对的数据集，评估13个模型，发现其在集合比较和多跳逻辑推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 模型在语义误解和隐式关系处理上存在系统性失败模式，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The increasing context length of modern language models has created a need
for evaluating their ability to retrieve and process information across
extensive documents. While existing benchmarks test long-context capabilities,
they often lack a structured way to systematically vary question complexity. We
introduce KG-QAGen (Knowledge-Graph-based Question-Answer Generation), a
framework that (1) extracts QA pairs at multiple complexity levels (2) by
leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three
key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality --
enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled
difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA
pairs (the largest number among the long-context benchmarks) and open-source a
part of it. We evaluate 13 proprietary and open-source LLMs and observe that
even the best-performing models are struggling with set-based comparisons and
multi-hop logical inference. Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes tied
to semantic misinterpretation and inability to handle implicit relations.

TL;DR: LM²otifs是一个新颖的可解释框架，用于检测机器生成文本（MGT），通过图神经网络和事后解释方法提供多层次的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检测方法在解释性上的不足，特别是难以捕捉区分人类生成文本（HGT）和MGT的复杂词汇关系。

Method: 1. 将文本转换为基于词共现的图表示词汇依赖；2. 使用图神经网络进行预测；3. 事后解释方法提取可解释的模因，提供从单词到句子结构的多层次解释。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，提取的解释性模因能有效区分HGT和MGT，并揭示MGT的独特语言特征。

Conclusion: LM²otifs不仅检测性能优越，还提供了可解释的分析工具，有助于理解MGT的生成机制。

Abstract: The impressive ability of large language models to generate natural text
across various tasks has led to critical challenges in authorship
authentication. Although numerous detection methods have been developed to
differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts
(HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap.
Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex
word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation,
we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection.
Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale
for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks
to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs
pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs
based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph
neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability
method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from
individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The
empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their
effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis
reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.

Result: 在PRIDE数据集上，DS-ProGen达到61.47%的恢复率，并在预测与生物伙伴的相互作用中表现优异。

Conclusion: DS-ProGen展示了多模态结构编码在蛋白质设计中的协同优势，具有强大的功能保留能力。

Abstract: Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) is a critical subtask in the field of protein
design, aiming to engineer amino acid sequences capable of folding correctly
into a specified three-dimensional (3D) conformation. Although substantial
progress has been achieved in recent years, existing methods generally rely on
either backbone coordinates or molecular surface features alone, which
restricts their ability to fully capture the complex chemical and geometric
constraints necessary for precise sequence prediction. To address this
limitation, we present DS-ProGen, a dual-structure deep language model for
functional protein design, which integrates both backbone geometry and
surface-level representations. By incorporating backbone coordinates as well as
surface chemical and geometric descriptors into a next-amino-acid prediction
paradigm, DS-ProGen is able to generate functionally relevant and structurally
stable sequences while satisfying both global and local conformational
constraints. On the PRIDE dataset, DS-ProGen attains the current
state-of-the-art recovery rate of 61.47%, demonstrating the synergistic
advantage of multi-modal structural encoding in protein design. Furthermore,
DS-ProGen excels in predicting interactions with a variety of biological
partners, including ligands, ions, and RNA, confirming its robust functional
retention capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly power mental-health chatbots, yet
the field still lacks a scalable, theory-grounded way to decide which model is
most effective to deploy. We present ESC-Judge, the first end-to-end evaluation
framework that (i) grounds head-to-head comparisons of emotional-support LLMs
in Clara Hill's established Exploration-Insight-Action counseling model,
providing a structured and interpretable view of performance, and (ii) fully
automates the evaluation pipeline at scale. ESC-Judge operates in three stages:
first, it synthesizes realistic help-seeker roles by sampling empirically
salient attributes such as stressors, personality, and life history; second, it
has two candidate support agents conduct separate sessions with the same role,
isolating model-specific strategies; and third, it asks a specialized judge LLM
to express pairwise preferences across rubric-anchored skills that span the
Exploration, Insight, and Action spectrum. In our study, ESC-Judge matched
PhD-level annotators on 85 percent of Exploration, 83 percent of Insight, and
86 percent of Action decisions, demonstrating human-level reliability at a
fraction of the cost. All code, prompts, synthetic roles, transcripts, and

Abstract: Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models
is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely
on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models
struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher
intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead
often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also
show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust
transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality
of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance
with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective
with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines
occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE
benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised
negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.

Abstract: Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With
the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become
even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the
context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the
definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems,
particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts,
categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a
comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore
publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution
techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we
identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for
further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research
on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the
development of more robust and reliable language systems.

Conclusion: TrafficSafe为交通安全研究提供了突破性进展，将AI技术转化为可操作的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting crash events is crucial for understanding crash distributions and
their contributing factors, thereby enabling the design of proactive traffic
safety policy interventions. However, existing methods struggle to interpret
the complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including
numeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental
conditions, and driver behavior records. As a result, they often fail to
capture the rich semantic information and intricate interrelationships embedded
in these diverse data sources, limiting their ability to identify critical
crash risk factors. In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that
adapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based
reasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports
together with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle
information is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset. By
customizing and fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset, the TrafficSafe LLM achieves
a 42% average improvement in F1-score over baselines. To interpret these
predictions and uncover contributing factors, we introduce TrafficSafe
Attribution, a sentence-level feature attribution framework enabling
conditional risk analysis. Findings show that alcohol-impaired driving is the
leading factor in severe crashes, with aggressive and impairment-related
behaviors having nearly twice the contribution for severe crashes compared to
other driver behaviors. Furthermore, TrafficSafe Attribution highlights pivotal
features during model training, guiding strategic crash data collection for
iterative performance improvements. The proposed TrafficSafe offers a
transformative leap in traffic safety research, providing a blueprint for
translating advanced AI technologies into responsible, actionable, and
life-saving outcomes.

Method: 使用概率提取技术从13个开源LLMs中提取Books3数据集的内容，并进行多项实验。

Result: 实验表明，部分书籍内容可从某些LLMs中提取，证明存在记忆化，但记忆化程度因模型和书籍而异。最大的LLMs并未记忆大部分书籍，但如Llama 3.1 70B几乎完全记忆了《哈利波特》和《1984》。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明记忆化与版权的关系复杂，结果对版权案件有重要影响，但并未明确支持任何一方。

Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make
sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models
(LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial
ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically
oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we
leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the
Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show
that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from
different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted
text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the
results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by
book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't
memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that
Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and 1984, almost
entirely. We discuss why our results have significant implications for
copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.

datasets are limited in what they reveal about universal properties of the
human language faculty. While this has begun to change through the efforts of
projects seeking to develop tagged corpora for a large number of languages,
such efforts are still constrained by limits on resources. The current paper
reports on a large automatically tagged parallel dataset which has been
developed to partially address this issue. The taggedPBC contains more than
1,800 sentences of pos-tagged parallel text data from over 1,500 languages,
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates, dwarfing previously
available resources. The accuracy of tags in this dataset is shown to correlate
well with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy,
Trankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks).
Additionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio,
correlates with expert determinations of word order in three typological
databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
trained on this feature can accurately identify basic word order for languages
not in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop
this dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based
crosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and
collaboration via GitHub.

### [102] [Enriching Patent Claim Generation with European Patent Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12568)
*Lekang Jiang,Chengzu Li,Stephan Goetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EPD（欧洲专利数据集），旨在扩展专利权利要求生成研究的范围，涵盖不同司法管辖区和法律标准。EPD通过提供高质量、多样化的专利数据，显著提升了语言模型在权利要求生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖美国专利商标局（USPTO）的数据，限制了研究范围。EPD的引入填补了欧洲专利数据的空白，支持更全面的评估和研究。

Method: 构建了EPD数据集，包含丰富的文本数据和结构化元数据，并设计了一个高难度子集以模拟真实世界的挑战。通过实验比较了基于EPD和其他数据集训练的LLMs的性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于EPD微调的LLMs在权利要求质量和跨领域泛化能力上显著优于其他数据集训练的模型，甚至优于GPT-4o。高难度子集测试显示所有模型表现均大幅下降。

Conclusion: EPD为专利权利要求生成研究提供了更全面的数据支持，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并呼吁未来研究应对更具挑战性的任务。

Abstract: Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional
skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to
assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied
on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To
enlarge research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions,
and legal standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents
rich textual data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related
tasks, including claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three
critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices
vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a
benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2)
Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and
legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are
unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on EPD
significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets and even GPT-4o in
claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world simulation: We
propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world challenges of
claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially
worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future
research.

*Hanwen Shen,Ting Ying*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在生成百万字小说时，人类撰写的大纲需要多详细才能保证质量。通过信息论分析，提出了一种两阶段生成方法，显著减少了语义失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架主要针对较短小说（10k--100k字），而超长小说生成的研究较少，需探索如何平衡大纲详细程度与生成质量。

Method: 采用信息论分析，提出两阶段生成流程（大纲→详细大纲→手稿），并通过实验确定最优大纲长度。

Result: 两阶段方法显著减少了语义失真，为百万字小说生成提供了实证指导。

Conclusion: 两阶段分层大纲方法在超长小说生成中优于单阶段方法，为作者和研究者提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question:
how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality
million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&Write, and Long Writer
have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily
target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely
unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like
LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that
quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long
novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical
two-stage generation pipeline (outline -> detailed outline -> manuscript) and
find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with
human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we
establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces
semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide
empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with
LLMs to create million-word novels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过表示引导技术，单层模型激活的调整显著提升了多语言处理性能，效果媲美翻译基线并超越提示优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）如何处理非英语标记，尽管该领域已有显著进展，但仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用表示引导技术，通过学习向量调整单层模型的激活，并结合监督微调（SFT）和人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）优化多语言能力。

Result: 该方法在多语言处理中表现优异，效果与翻译基线相当，并超越现有提示优化方法。

Conclusion: 表示引导技术结合SFT和RLHF可有效优化LLM的多语言能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMS) process
non-English tokens within their layer representations, an open question despite
significant advancements in the field. Using representation steering,
specifically by adding a learned vector to a single model layer's activations,
we demonstrate that steering a single model layer can notably enhance
performance. Our analysis shows that this approach achieves results comparable
to translation baselines and surpasses state of the art prompt optimization
methods. Additionally, we highlight how advanced techniques like supervised
fine tuning (\textsc{sft}) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(\textsc{rlhf}) improve multilingual capabilities by altering representation
spaces. We further illustrate how these methods align with our approach to
reshaping LLMS layer representations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CMLFormer是一种改进的双解码器Transformer模型，用于处理代码混合语言，通过多任务预训练策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准语言模型难以处理代码混合语言中的语言转换问题，因此需要专门设计的模型来捕捉其结构和语义动态。

Method: 提出CMLFormer，采用共享编码器和同步解码器交叉注意力机制，预训练时结合切换点、翻译注释和多任务目标。

Result: 在HASOC-2021基准测试中，CMLFormer在F1分数、精确度和准确率上优于其他方法，并能有效识别切换点。

Conclusion: CMLFormer的架构和多任务预训练策略对代码混合语言建模有效。

Abstract: Code-mixed languages, characterized by frequent within-sentence language
transitions, present structural challenges that standard language models fail
to address. In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer
dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder
cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of
code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with
switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives
specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure,
and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1
score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021
benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show
that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity
to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling
code-mixed languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PromptPrism，一个用于系统分析提示（prompt）的语言学分类法，通过三个层次（功能结构、语义组件和句法模式）优化LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域缺乏系统分析提示的框架，理解提示结构和组件对优化LLM行为至关重要。

Method: 引入PromptPrism分类法，应用于提示优化、数据集分析和敏感性实验。

Result: 实验验证了PromptPrism在提示优化、数据集分析和敏感性分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptPrism为提示的优化、分析和理解提供了基础。

Abstract: Prompts are the interface for eliciting the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Understanding their structure and components is critical for
analyzing LLM behavior and optimizing performance. However, the field lacks a
comprehensive framework for systematic prompt analysis and understanding. We
introduce PromptPrism, a linguistically-inspired taxonomy that enables prompt
analysis across three hierarchical levels: functional structure, semantic
component, and syntactic pattern. We show the practical utility of PromptPrism
by applying it to three applications: (1) a taxonomy-guided prompt refinement
approach that automatically improves prompt quality and enhances model
performance across a range of tasks; (2) a multi-dimensional dataset profiling
method that extracts and aggregates structural, semantic, and syntactic
characteristics from prompt datasets, enabling comprehensive analysis of prompt
distributions and patterns; (3) a controlled experimental framework for prompt
sensitivity analysis by quantifying the impact of semantic reordering and
delimiter modifications on LLM performance. Our experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our taxonomy across these applications, demonstrating that
PromptPrism provides a foundation for refining, profiling, and analyzing
prompts.

TL;DR: AD-AGENT是一个基于LLM的多智能体框架，通过自然语言指令生成可执行的异常检测流程，整合多个AD库，为非专家用户提供便捷的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测（AD）在多个领域至关重要，但数据模态多样性和专业库的复杂性为非专家用户带来挑战。

Method: AD-AGENT通过协调多个智能体（意图解析、数据准备、库和模型选择、文档挖掘、代码生成与调试）和共享工作空间，整合PyOD、PyGOD等AD库。

Result: 实验表明AD-AGENT能生成可靠脚本并推荐跨库的竞争性模型。

Conclusion: AD-AGENT开源支持进一步研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in areas such as fraud detection, network
monitoring, and scientific research. However, the diversity of data modalities
and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for
non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced
programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven
multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully
executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent
parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining,
and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term
workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like
PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that
AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across
libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical
applications in AD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Duluth方法在SemEval-2025任务7中的多语言和跨语言事实核查声明检索中的应用，基于TF-IDF的检索系统在优化后表现良好，但仍落后于顶尖系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在多语言和跨语言环境下，传统TF-IDF方法在事实核查声明检索任务中的表现及其优化潜力。

Method: 采用TF-IDF检索系统，实验了不同向量维度和分词策略，最佳配置为词级分词和15,000特征词汇表。

Result: 开发集平均success@10得分为0.78，测试集为0.69，表现优于低资源语言，但显著落后于顶尖系统（0.96）。

Conclusion: 尽管神经架构在多语言检索中占主导，但优化后的传统TF-IDF方法在资源有限场景下仍具竞争力。

Abstract: This paper presents the Duluth approach to the SemEval-2025 Task 7 on
Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. We implemented a
TF-IDF-based retrieval system with experimentation on vector dimensions and
tokenization strategies. Our best-performing configuration used word-level
tokenization with a vocabulary size of 15,000 features, achieving an average
success@10 score of 0.78 on the development set and 0.69 on the test set across
ten languages. Our system showed stronger performance on higher-resource
languages but still lagged significantly behind the top-ranked system, which
achieved 0.96 average success@10. Our findings suggest that though advanced
neural architectures are increasingly dominant in multilingual retrieval tasks,
properly optimized traditional methods like TF-IDF remain competitive
baselines, especially in limited compute resource scenarios.

*João Eduardo Batista,Emil Vatai,Mohamed Wahib*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种句子级预归属步骤，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学应用中的可信度和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成答案时缺乏可靠的来源归属，甚至存在错误归属，阻碍了其在科学和高风险场景中的应用。

Method: 通过句子级分类（不可归属、可归属单一引用、可归属多引用）优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统，减少计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明分类器适合此任务，并提供了干净的HAGRID数据集和即用型端到端归属系统。

Conclusion: 预归属步骤能有效提升LLMs输出的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science
domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical
challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often
generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect
attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes
settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be
reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short
lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole
document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for
Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three
categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable
to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper
attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution
can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are
well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to
reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of
the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out
of the box.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究R1模型在政治敏感话题上的审查行为，揭示其潜在的设计选择和对透明度、偏见及治理的影响。

Method: 引入大规模提示集分析R1的审查模式，包括一致性、触发条件和跨语言行为，并研究其蒸馏模型的审查可转移性。

Result: R1的审查行为可能源于训练或对齐过程中的设计选择，引发对模型透明度和偏见的担忧。

Conclusion: R1的审查行为揭示了语言模型部署中的潜在问题，需进一步探讨透明度和治理机制。

Abstract: DeepSeek recently released R1, a high-performing large language model (LLM)
optimized for reasoning tasks. Despite its efficient training pipeline, R1
achieves competitive performance, even surpassing leading reasoning models like
OpenAI's o1 on several benchmarks. However, emerging reports suggest that R1
refuses to answer certain prompts related to politically sensitive topics in
China. While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating
harmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting
censorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we
investigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily
curated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically
sensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a
comprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their
consistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and
context. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in
other languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to
models distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for
bypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional
censorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or
alignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in
language model deployment.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑算法在常规指标上表现优异，但编辑后的模型仍可能生成原始知识，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过系统性评估，识别并验证了导致表面编辑的两大因素：早期层的残差流和后期层特定注意力模块中的注意力头及其左奇异向量。

Result: 研究发现特定注意力头及其左奇异向量与表面编辑存在因果关系，并在“表面遗忘”任务中验证了结论的普适性。

Conclusion: 表面编辑现象对现有算法构成挑战，研究方法和结论具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language
models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing
algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models
edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper
introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon.
Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant
challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify
and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual
stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific
attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later
layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices,
encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with
superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of
superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of
specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby
demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and
conclusions. Our code is available here.

Abstract: This paper addresses the gap in predicting turn-taking and backchannel
actions in human-machine conversations using multi-modal signals (linguistic,
acoustic, and visual). To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we
propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and
annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a
Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over
1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from
approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that
predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from
multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between
modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs,
making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and
backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10\% increase in F1-score on
turn-taking and a 33\% increase on backchannel prediction. Our dataset and code
are publicly available online to ease of subsequent research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成内容时存在幻觉或未经证实的问题，现有RAG系统因外部知识监督不足和参考不准确而受限。

Method: Know3-RAG利用知识图谱嵌入评估答案置信度，增强查询的实体相关性，并通过语义对齐过滤参考。

Result: 在多个开放域QA基准测试中，Know3-RAG表现优于基线模型，显著减少幻觉并提升可靠性。

Conclusion: Know3-RAG通过结构化知识整合，有效解决了RAG系统的局限性，提升了生成内容的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive
progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce
hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve
factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external
knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major
limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge
supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant
references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware
RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs)
to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation,
and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval
module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated
answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference
generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve
generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering
mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references.
Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG
consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing
hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Shadow-FT的新框架，通过利用BASE模型的权重更新来微调INSTRUCT模型，显著提升了性能，且无需额外参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接微调INSTRUCT模型往往效果有限甚至导致性能下降，而对应的BASE模型权重与INSTRUCT模型高度相似，因此提出了Shadow-FT框架。

Method: 通过微调BASE模型，并将学习到的权重更新直接移植到INSTRUCT模型中，实现高效微调。

Result: 在19个基准测试中，Shadow-FT在编码、推理和数学任务上均优于传统全参数和参数高效微调方法。

Conclusion: Shadow-FT不仅适用于单模态LLM，还可扩展到多模态MLLM，并与DPO结合使用，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on
various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e.,
instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even
performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these
INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on
average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to
tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key
insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned
weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no
additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves
performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such
as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering
coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and
parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT
can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with
direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维（CoT）推理存在冗长输出和缺乏系统性的问题，而树状思维（ToT）提供了更高效的并行推理方法。

Method: 引入ToTRL框架，结合规则奖励和LLM作为玩家解决谜题游戏，训练模型并行生成和评估推理分支。

Result: 实验表明，ToTQwen3-8B模型在复杂推理任务中显著提升了性能和效率。

Conclusion: ToTRL框架有效改进了LLM的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities,
particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be
elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning
presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection.
The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error
methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast,
tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling
reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure
facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning
branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of
unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance
and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we
introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a
rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel
ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs
as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle
games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing
multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a
thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning
capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model,
trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and
reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法减少了人为主观性，提高了公平性、可扩展性和可重复性，适用于审计GenAI生成的教育内容。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have
transformed educational content creation, particularly in developing tutor
training materials. However, biases embedded in AI-generated content--such as
gender, racial, or national stereotypes--raise significant ethical and
educational concerns. Despite the growing use of GenAI, systematic methods for
detecting and evaluating such biases in educational materials remain limited.
This study proposes an automated bias assessment approach that integrates the
Contextualized Embedding Association Test with a prompt-engineered word
extraction method within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. We applied
this method to AI-generated texts used in tutor training lessons. Results show
a high alignment between the automated and manually curated word sets, with a
Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.993, indicating reliable and
consistent bias assessment. Our method reduces human subjectivity and enhances
fairness, scalability, and reproducibility in auditing GenAI-produced
educational content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在代码生成任务中表现出色，但在不同编程语言间的性能差距显著。论文旨在通过代码翻译任务和强化学习框架缩小这一差距。

Method: 论文提出OORL框架，结合策略内和策略外强化学习，并引入GEPO方法，通过中间表示（IRs）组优化模型偏好，以提升代码功能识别能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，OORL框架显著提高了LLMs在多语言代码基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过代码翻译任务和OORL框架训练LLMs，可以有效提升其在不同编程语言中的代码生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code
generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between
popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this
capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby
facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming
languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies.
Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a
rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this
coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference
Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO
trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be
guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones,
while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within
the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code
functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs
improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the
relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation
tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across
multiple programming languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReEx-SQL提出了一种新的Text-to-SQL框架，通过执行感知的强化学习动态调整推理过程，显著提升了查询准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将执行反馈作为后验信号，未能将其整合到生成过程中，导致推理错误无法及时纠正。

Method: ReEx-SQL结合结构化提示和逐步展开策略，将执行反馈融入生成过程，并通过复合奖励函数监督策略学习。

Result: 在Spider和BIRD数据集上分别达到88.8%和64.9%的准确率，推理时间减少51.9%。

Conclusion: ReEx-SQL通过动态调整推理路径和数据库交互，显著提升了Text-to-SQL的性能和效率。

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL, execution feedback is essential for guiding large language
models (LLMs) to reason accurately and generate reliable SQL queries. However,
existing methods treat execution feedback solely as a post-hoc signal for
correction or selection, failing to integrate it into the generation process.
This limitation hinders their ability to address reasoning errors as they
occur, ultimately reducing query accuracy and robustness. To address this
issue, we propose ReEx-SQL (Reasoning with Execution-Aware Reinforcement
Learning), a framework for Text-to-SQL that enables models to interact with the
database during decoding and dynamically adjust their reasoning based on
execution feedback. ReEx-SQL introduces an execution-aware reasoning paradigm
that interleaves intermediate SQL execution into reasoning paths, facilitating
context-sensitive revisions. It achieves this through structured prompts with
markup tags and a stepwise rollout strategy that integrates execution feedback
into each stage of generation. To supervise policy learning, we develop a
composite reward function that includes an exploration reward, explicitly
encouraging effective database interaction. Additionally, ReEx-SQL adopts a
tree-based decoding strategy to support exploratory reasoning, enabling dynamic
expansion of alternative reasoning paths. Notably, ReEx-SQL achieves 88.8% on
Spider and 64.9% on BIRD at the 7B scale, surpassing the standard reasoning
baseline by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. It also shows robustness, achieving
85.2% on Spider-Realistic with leading performance. In addition, its
tree-structured decoding improves efficiency and performance over linear
decoding, reducing inference time by 51.9% on the BIRD development set.

TL;DR: LRC是一种高效的预训练方法，通过低秩投影矩阵实现软剪枝和激活对齐，显著提升小语言模型的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有小语言模型训练中的信息丢失、表示对齐效率低和FFN激活信号未充分利用的问题。

Method: 引入低秩克隆（LRC），通过低秩投影矩阵实现软剪枝和激活对齐，无需显式对齐模块。

Result: 实验表明，LRC仅需20B token即可匹配或超越现有模型，训练效率提升1000倍。

Conclusion: LRC为小语言模型的高效训练提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even
with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing
work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning,
(2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of
informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To
address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient
pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence
with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices
that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation
clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the
teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the
need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source
teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of
tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency.

Motivation: 传统NLP模型（如BERT）在识别人类价值观任务中表现不足，而在线LLMs处理长上下文时性能下降且计算成本高。

Method: 提出EAVIT框架，使用本地小型模型生成初始估计，构建简洁输入提示供在线LLMs使用，并采用解释性训练和数据生成技术优化。

Result: 输入令牌数量减少至1/6，性能优于传统NLP方法和基于LLM的其他策略。

Conclusion: EAVIT框架高效且准确，适用于人类价值观识别任务。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values
within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been
employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is
significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance
of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value
identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for
human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally
fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector
- a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These
estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs,
enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we
introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques
specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies
to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces
the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online
LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other
LLM-based strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准测试方法存在封闭式问题饱和、人工评估成本高或依赖单一模型导致偏见等问题，亟需一种可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Method: dearena通过民主化的成对评估减少单一模型偏见，并采用粗到细的排名算法和自动问题选择策略，实现高效扩展。

Result: 在66个LLMs上的实验表明，dearena与人类判断的相关性高达97%，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: dearena提供了一种高效、低成本且可靠的LLMs评估方法，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), each with its own
general or specialized strengths, makes scalable, reliable benchmarking more
urgent than ever. Standard practices nowadays face fundamental trade-offs:
closed-ended question-based benchmarks (eg MMLU) struggle with saturation as
newer models emerge, while crowd-sourced leaderboards (eg Chatbot Arena) rely
on costly and slow human judges. Recently, automated methods (eg
LLM-as-a-judge) shed light on the scalability, but risk bias by relying on one
or a few "authority" models. To tackle these issues, we propose Decentralized
Arena (dearena), a fully automated framework leveraging collective intelligence
from all LLMs to evaluate each other. It mitigates single-model judge bias by
democratic, pairwise evaluation, and remains efficient at scale through two key
components: (1) a coarse-to-fine ranking algorithm for fast incremental
insertion of new models with sub-quadratic complexity, and (2) an automatic
question selection strategy for the construction of new evaluation dimensions.
Across extensive experiments across 66 LLMs, dearena attains up to 97%
correlation with human judgements, while significantly reducing the cost. Our
code and data will be publicly released on
https://github.com/maitrix-org/de-arena.

TL;DR: PsyMem提出了一种结合细粒度心理属性和显式记忆控制的角色扮演框架，解决了现有方法在角色建模和记忆一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的角色扮演方法依赖浅层文本描述或简单指标，无法充分建模角色的内外维度，且记忆模拟缺乏显式对齐，影响可靠性。

Method: PsyMem通过26个心理指标补充角色描述，并引入记忆对齐训练，显式训练模型使角色响应与记忆一致。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上训练的PsyMem-Qwen在角色扮演中表现优于基线模型，人类相似度和角色保真度最佳。

Conclusion: PsyMem通过心理属性和显式记忆控制提升了角色扮演的可靠性和表现。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual
descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and
extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character
memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation
without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two
issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as
trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem,
a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and
explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual
descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character.
Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains
the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic
memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962
dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen,
outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in
human-likeness and character fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SynDec的新方法，通过自动合成高质量提示并在解码阶段放大其作用，解决了大型语言模型（LLMs）在任意风格转换中的两个关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本风格转换中表现出色，但在任意风格转换中面临依赖手动构建提示和固有风格偏见的挑战。

Method: SynDec方法通过选择代表性少样本、进行四维风格分析并重新排序候选提示，合成高质量提示；在解码阶段，通过最大化输出概率对比来放大提示效果。

Result: 实验表明，SynDec在六分之五的基准测试中优于现有方法，例如在现代英语到伊丽莎白英语转换中准确率提升9%。

Conclusion: SynDec通过自动合成提示和优化解码过程，显著提升了LLMs在风格转换中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as dominant forces for textual
style transfer. However, for arbitrary style transfer, LLMs face two key
challenges: (1) considerable reliance on manually-constructed prompts and (2)
rigid stylistic biases inherent in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel
Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes
high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process.
Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative
few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking
the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by
maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and
without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative
samples. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that SynDec
outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on five out of six
benchmarks (e.g., achieving up to a 9\% increase in accuracy for
modern-to-Elizabethan English transfer). Detailed ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of SynDec.

Motivation: 现有方法通过提示工程从大型语言模型（LLM）中提取句子嵌入，但最后一个标记仍包含过多非核心信息（如停用词），限制了编码能力。

Method: 提出对比提示（CP）方法，通过引入辅助提示与现有提示对比，引导模型编码句子的核心语义而非非必要信息。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）任务和下游分类任务中，CP方法显著提升了现有基于提示的方法的性能。

Conclusion: CP是一种即插即用的推理时间干预方法，适用于多种提示方法，能有效提升句子嵌入的质量。

Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a
practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning.
Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode
the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last
token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of
non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity.
To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an
extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with
the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core
semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a
plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with
various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our
method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across
different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is vital
for applications such as disaster response, logistics delivery, and urban
inspection. However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient
multimodal fusion, weak generalization, and poor interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose FlightGPT, a novel UAV VLN framework built upon
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with powerful multimodal perception capabilities.
We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured
reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by
a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format
compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT
introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve
decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset
CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across
all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in
unseen environments. Our implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: Legal contracts possess an inherent, semantically vital structure (e.g.,
sections, clauses) that is crucial for human comprehension but whose impact on
LLM processing remains under-explored. This paper investigates the effects of
explicit input text structure and prompt engineering on the performance of
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 on a legal question-answering task using an excerpt of the
CUAD. We compare model exact-match accuracy across various input formats:
well-structured plain-text (human-generated from CUAD), plain-text cleaned of
line breaks, extracted plain-text from Azure OCR, plain-text extracted by
GPT-4o Vision, and extracted (and interpreted) Markdown (MD) from GPT-4o
Vision. To give an indication of the impact of possible prompt engineering, we
assess the impact of shifting task instructions to the system prompt and
explicitly informing the model about the structured nature of the input. Our
findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates considerable robustness to variations
in input structure, but lacks in overall performance. Conversely, GPT-4.1's
performance is markedly sensitive; poorly structured inputs yield suboptimal
results (but identical with GPT-4o), while well-structured formats (original
CUAD text, GPT-4o Vision text and GPT-4o MD) improve exact-match accuracy by
~20 percentage points. Optimizing the system prompt to include task details and
an advisory about structured input further elevates GPT-4.1's accuracy by an
additional ~10-13 percentage points, with Markdown ultimately achieving the
highest performance under these conditions (79 percentage points overall
exact-match accuracy). This research empirically demonstrates that while newer
models exhibit greater resilience, careful input structuring and strategic
prompt design remain critical for optimizing the performance of LLMs, and can
significantly affect outcomes in high-stakes legal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究去标识化方法的鲁棒性，探索如何通过背景知识重新识别被掩码的个人信息。

Method: 采用RAG框架，先通过检索器选择相关背景知识段落，再通过填充模型推断掩码内容，迭代直至所有掩码被替换。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验显示，80%的掩码信息可被恢复，且恢复准确率随背景知识增加而提高。

Conclusion: 去标识化方法的鲁棒性存在不足，背景知识对重新识别有显著影响。

Abstract: Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be
de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of
personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to
uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the
robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired
approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a
database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which
personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two
steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed
relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an
infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span.
This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the
re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and
clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text
spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy
increases along with the level of background knowledge.

Conclusion: LEXam为评估法律推理质量提供了可扩展的方法，超越了简单的准确性指标。

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models
(LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a
novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses
across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law
exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended
questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the
open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected
legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule
application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions
present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably
struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal
reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in
differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate
how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and
accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal

Conclusion: GAP框架通过显式建模患者信息和结合外部知识，显著提升了对话式药物推荐的准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare
domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue
systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic
health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require
research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is
crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models
(LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret
patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication
recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a
multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or
connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate
suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a
lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain.
To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted
\textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication
recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from
dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe
the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external
medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus
retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual
responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation
dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario,
dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.

### [131] [On the Thinking-Language Modeling Gap in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12896)
*Chenxi Liu,Yongqiang Chen,Tongliang Liu,James Cheng,Bo Han,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Language-of-Thoughts（LoT）的新提示技术，用于减少大型语言模型（LLMs）中的语言建模偏差，并提升其在多种推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，语言模型在模拟人类语言时容易吸收语言偏差，导致其推理过程偏离人类思维链，从而影响推理效果。

Method: 提出LoT技术，通过调整表达顺序和词汇使用，引导LLMs更全面地表达相关信息，而非直接从部分信息中引出思维链。

Result: 实验表明，LoT显著减少了LLMs的语言建模偏差，并在多种推理任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: LoT是一种简单有效的技术，能够缩小语言与思维之间的建模差距，提升LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence,
which requires slow and logical thinking. Human conducts System 2 reasoning via
the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal
sequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that
System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs)
pre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show
that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.
As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking,
modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated
from the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will
mislead the eliciting of "thoughts" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of
the premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed
Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. Instead of
directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT
instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all
the relevant information. We show that the simple strategy significantly
reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of
LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 在强化学习中，低概率token的梯度干扰会抑制高概率token的学习，影响模型性能，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出Advantage Reweighting和Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti)两种方法，分别通过重新加权优势和隔离低概率token的梯度来平衡模型更新。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了低概率token梯度干扰问题，提升了强化学习训练的效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with recent innovations
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional
effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in
RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates
due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective
learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs'
performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we
propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token
Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from
low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by
high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens
with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training.
Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the
performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K
Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks. Our implementation is available at

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Xinye Cao,Pedro Gimenes,George A. Constantinides,Wayne Luk,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为A³的后训练低秩近似框架，通过将Transformer层拆分为三个功能组件并优化其功能损失，显著降低了模型大小和计算开销，同时保持了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似方法存在两个主要问题：未考虑Transformer架构特性，以及分解后引入运行时开销。A³旨在解决这些问题，提升压缩效果和性能。

Method: A³将Transformer层分为QK、OV和MLP三个组件，为每个组件提供解析解以减少隐藏维度大小，同时最小化功能损失。

Result: 实验表明，A³在相同计算和内存预算下优于现有方法，例如LLaMA 3.1-70B在WikiText-2上的困惑度从7.87降至4.69。

Conclusion: A³不仅高效压缩模型，还支持KV缓存压缩、量化和混合秩分配，为低秩近似提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however,
their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank
approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches
have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of
individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics
of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small
low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to
other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce
runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small
matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a
post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a
Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$,
and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical
solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while
minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention
scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces
model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime
overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the
optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward
improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that
$\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,
under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank
approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,
outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the
versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and
mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Nguni语言（一种黏着语）的形态解析任务，探索神经方法的有效性，以解决其复杂的形态结构问题。

Method: 采用两种神经方法：从头训练的神经序列标记器（LSTM和神经CRF）和微调预训练语言模型，并与传统规则解析器对比。

Result: 神经标记器显著优于规则解析器，且从头训练的模型通常优于预训练模型。

Conclusion: 神经标记器结合现有形态分割器在Nguni语言中是可行的。

Abstract: Morphological parsing is the task of decomposing words into morphemes, the
smallest units of meaning in a language, and labelling their grammatical roles.
It is a particularly challenging task for agglutinative languages, such as the
Nguni languages of South Africa, which construct words by concatenating
multiple morphemes. A morphological parsing system can be framed as a pipeline
with two separate components, a segmenter followed by a tagger. This paper
investigates the use of neural methods to build morphological taggers for the
four Nguni languages. We compare two classes of approaches: training neural
sequence labellers (LSTMs and neural CRFs) from scratch and finetuning
pretrained language models. We compare performance across these two categories,
as well as to a traditional rule-based morphological parser. Neural taggers
comfortably outperform the rule-based baseline and models trained from scratch
tend to outperform pretrained models. We also compare parsing results across
different upstream segmenters and with varying linguistic input features. Our
findings confirm the viability of employing neural taggers based on
pre-existing morphological segmenters for the Nguni languages.

TL;DR: GuRE利用大语言模型生成改写查询，解决法律文本检索中的词汇不匹配问题，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本检索（LPR）因查询与目标段落词汇不匹配而未被充分探索，亟需有效解决方案。

Method: 提出Generative query REwriter（GuRE），通过训练大语言模型改写查询以减少词汇不匹配。

Result: GuRE在检索器无关的方式下显著优于基线方法，且不同训练目标导致不同检索行为。

Conclusion: GuRE比直接微调检索器更适合实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners
save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored
avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the
query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the
generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for
query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target
passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE
significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner,
outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different
training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more
suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications. Codes
are avaiable at github.com/daehuikim/GuRE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念识别方法难以捕捉文本中未明确提及的复杂概念，限制了知识图谱构建和本体优化的效果。

Method: MA-COIR结合预训练的BART模型和小数据集微调，利用LLM生成的查询和合成数据提升低资源环境下的识别能力。

Result: 在CDR、HPO和HOIP三个场景中，MA-COIR能有效识别显式和隐式概念，无需推理时的提及级标注。

Conclusion: MA-COIR为生物医学领域的本体驱动概念识别提供了高效且低资源需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing biomedical concepts in the text is vital for ontology refinement,
knowledge graph construction, and concept relationship discovery. However,
traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention
identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in
the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that
reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning
semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in
ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained
BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces
computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts.
Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and
synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental
results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of
MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for
mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept
recognition in biomedical domain applications. Our code and constructed data
are available at https://github.com/sl-633/macoir-master.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper在非语音段存在幻觉问题，限制了其在复杂工业场景中的应用。

Method: 通过头部掩码分析Whisper-large-v3解码器中各注意力头对幻觉的贡献，并微调关键头部。

Result: 微调后的模型Calm-Whisper在非语音段幻觉减少80%以上，且词错误率仅增加不到0.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了Whisper的幻觉问题，提升了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: OpenAI's Whisper has achieved significant success in Automatic Speech
Recognition. However, it has consistently been found to exhibit hallucination
issues, particularly in non-speech segments, which limits its broader
application in complex industrial settings.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method to reduce Whisper's hallucination
on non-speech segments without using any pre- or post-possessing techniques.
Specifically, we benchmark the contribution of each self-attentional head in
the Whisper-large-v3 decoder to the hallucination problem by performing a
head-wise mask. Our findings reveal that only 3 of the 20 heads account for
over 75% of the hallucinations on the UrbanSound dataset. We then fine-tune
these three crazy heads using a collection of non-speech data. The results show
that our best fine-tuned model, namely Calm-Whisper, achieves over 80%
reduction in non-speech hallucination with only less than 0.1% WER degradation
on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other.

Abstract: The continued rise of neural networks and large language models in the more
recent past has altered the natural language processing landscape, enabling new
approaches towards typical language tasks and achieving mainstream success.
Despite the huge success of large language models, many disadvantages still
remain and through this work we assess the state of the art in five application
scenarios with a particular focus on the future perspectives and sensible
application scenarios of traditional and older approaches and techniques.
  In this paper we survey recent publications in the application scenarios
classification, information and relation extraction, text simplification as
well as text summarization. After defining our terminology, i.e., which
features are characteristic for traditional techniques in our interpretation
for the five scenarios, we survey if such traditional approaches are still
being used, and if so, in what way they are used. It turns out that all five
application scenarios still exhibit traditional models in one way or another,
as part of a processing pipeline, as a comparison/baseline to the core model of
the respective paper, or as the main model(s) of the paper. For the complete

Result: 深度学习系统和eSpeak的同形异义词消歧准确率提升约30%。

Conclusion: 利用离线数据集开发快速规则方法，适用于实时应用，显著提升消歧效果。

Abstract: Homograph disambiguation remains a significant challenge in
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, especially for low-resource languages.
This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph
datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation
strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this
paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for
constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset
generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying
it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian.
Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to
inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for
latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end,
we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a
fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate
30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep
learning-based and eSpeak systems.

Conclusion: LLMs在M2MS任务中潜力显著，但需解决事实性问题以提升实际应用价值。

Abstract: Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language
and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them
the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a
systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first
reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The
reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six
languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark
18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned
traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our
experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with
fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can
significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs
(including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we
demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs'
general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation,
LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might
intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when
building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future
research.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）在机器翻译（MT）中的应用主要集中在高资源语言，且奖励建模方法未能充分发挥强化学习的潜力。

Method: 设计了一种新的奖励建模方法，将策略MT模型的翻译结果与强大的LRM（DeepSeek-R1-671B）进行比较，量化比较结果以提供奖励。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了多语言机器翻译性能，展示了强化学习在MT中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, has shown impressive capabilities in complex
problems, e.g., mathematics and coding. Some pioneering studies attempt to
bring the success of LRMs in neural machine translation (MT). They try to build
LRMs with deep reasoning MT ability via reinforcement learning (RL). Despite
some progress that has been made, these attempts generally focus on several
high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, leaving the performance on
other languages unclear. Besides, the reward modeling methods in previous work
do not fully unleash the potential of reinforcement learning in MT. In this
work, we first design a new reward modeling method that compares the
translation results of the policy MT model with a strong LRM (i.e.,
DeepSeek-R1-671B), and quantifies the comparisons to provide rewards.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the reward modeling method.
Using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, the trained model achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance in literary translation, and outperforms strong
LRMs including OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeeK-R1. Furthermore, we extend our method to
the multilingual settings with 11 languages. With a carefully designed
lightweight reward modeling in RL, we can simply transfer the strong MT ability
from a single direction into multiple (i.e., 90) translation directions and
achieve impressive multilingual MT performance.

Abstract: Existing code generation benchmarks primarily evaluate functional
correctness, with limited focus on code efficiency and often restricted to a
single language like Python. To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the
first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of
LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby,
and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert
solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on
EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they
consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient
LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human
efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show
better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and
Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient
than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into
LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse
languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and

Abstract: Airports from the top 20 in terms of annual passengers are highly dynamic
environments with thousands of flights daily, and they aim to increase the
degree of automation. To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI

resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions
involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL
RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that
traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally
produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG
and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with
significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially
effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we
thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due
to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.

*Himel Ghosh,Ahmed Mosharafa,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于RoBERTa的句子级媒体偏见检测方法，通过微调BABE数据集，显著提升了性能，并展示了模型的泛化能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 媒体偏见检测对信息公平传播至关重要，但由于偏见的主观性和高质量标注数据的稀缺性，该任务具有挑战性。

Method: 通过微调RoBERTa模型，使用McNemar检验和5x2交叉验证t检验验证性能提升，并结合注意力分析避免常见问题。

Result: 模型在性能上显著优于基线DA-RoBERTa，且能更关注上下文相关标记，泛化能力和可解释性良好。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更鲁棒、可解释且社会责任的NLP系统提供了基础，未来可探索上下文建模和偏见类型分类。

Abstract: Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced
information dissemination, yet it remains challenging due to the subjectivity
of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we
perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model
on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2
cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements
in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained
DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model
avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and
instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a
comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines
our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits
good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by
sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more
advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias
neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future
directions. Our findings contribute to building more robust, explainable, and
socially responsible NLP systems for media bias detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了topicwizard框架，用于通用主题模型解释，提供直观交互工具帮助用户理解文档、词汇和主题间的复杂语义关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主题模型参数丰富且复杂，用户通常仅通过词汇列表解释主题，导致理解有限且有偏差，需更全面的可视化工具。

Method: 提出topicwizard框架，支持模型无关的主题模型解释，提供交互式工具。

Result: topicwizard帮助用户更全面准确地理解主题模型的输出。

Conclusion: topicwizard为复杂主题模型提供了有效的解释工具，弥补了现有可视化工具的局限性。

Abstract: Topic models are statistical tools that allow their users to gain qualitative
and quantitative insights into the contents of textual corpora without the need
for close reading. They can be applied in a wide range of settings from
discourse analysis, through pretraining data curation, to text filtering. Topic
models are typically parameter-rich, complex models, and interpreting these
parameters can be challenging for their users. It is typical practice for users
to interpret topics based on the top 10 highest ranking terms on a given topic.
This list-of-words approach, however, gives users a limited and biased picture
of the content of topics. Thoughtful user interface design and visualizations
can help users gain a more complete and accurate understanding of topic models'
output. While some visualization utilities do exist for topic models, these are
typically limited to a certain type of topic model. We introduce topicwizard, a
framework for model-agnostic topic model interpretation, that provides
intuitive and interactive tools that help users examine the complex semantic
relations between documents, words and topics learned by topic models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代系统能力的提升，尤其是LLMs的成功，推动了IWSLT任务的多样化。

Method: 离线语音翻译采用多ASR系统输出融合和两步翻译流程；指令跟随任务采用端到端模型结合LLM。

Result: 通过文档级上下文和细化步骤提升了翻译和指令跟随任务的性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在语音翻译和指令跟随任务中表现出色，结合上下文细化可进一步提升质量。

Abstract: The scope of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation
(IWSLT) has recently broadened beyond traditional Speech Translation (ST) to
encompass a wider array of tasks, including Speech Question Answering and
Summarization. This shift is partly driven by the growing capabilities of
modern systems, particularly with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
In this paper, we present the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's submissions
for the Offline ST and Instruction Following (IF) tracks, where we leverage
LLMs to enhance performance across all tasks. For the Offline ST track, we
propose a pipeline that employs multiple automatic speech recognition systems,
whose outputs are fused using an LLM with document-level context. This is
followed by a two-step translation process, incorporating additional refinement
step to improve translation quality. For the IF track, we develop an end-to-end
model that integrates a speech encoder with an LLM to perform a wide range of
instruction-following tasks. We complement it with a final document-level
refinement stage to further enhance output quality by using contextual
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应不同用户的解释需求是对话系统的关键挑战，需要动态调整策略。

Method: 采用贝叶斯推断更新用户模型，结合非平稳马尔可夫决策过程动态调整解释策略。

Result: 实验表明，框架能有效适应不同用户（包括反馈行为变化的用户），生成个性化解释策略。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了可解释AI系统和对话系统的适应性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Adapting to the addressee is crucial for successful explanations, yet poses
significant challenges for dialogsystems. We adopt the approach of treating
explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal
strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the
interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track
the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally
defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the
dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently
best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to
continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a
non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the
partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five
simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to
different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The
results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for
different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve
explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.

Motivation: 研究动机是基于SpeechWellness挑战的需求，开发一种可靠的语音自杀风险评估方法，尤其是在青少年群体中。

Method: 方法包括使用WhisperX自动转录、中文RoBERTa生成语言嵌入、WavLM生成音频嵌入，以及手工声学特征（如MFCCs）。研究了三种融合策略：早期拼接、模态特定处理和加权注意力加mixup正则化。

Result: 加权注意力策略在开发集上达到69%准确率，但开发集与测试集之间的性能差距表明泛化能力仍需提升。

Conclusion: 结论强调了改进嵌入表示和融合机制的重要性，以提升分类可靠性，尤其是在MINI-KID框架下。

Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide
risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach
for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX,
linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM.
Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral
contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three
fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and
weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted
attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the
development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets
highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the
MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding
representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NTIL的损失函数，用于改进自回归模型在数字序列生成中的性能，通过结合token级和序列级的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归模型在处理数字序列时忽略了数字之间的连贯结构，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出NTIL损失函数，结合token级的Earth Mover's Distance（EMD）和序列级的整体差异惩罚。

Result: 实验表明NTIL显著提升了数字序列生成的性能。

Conclusion: NTIL是一种有效的改进方法，适用于LLMs/MLLMs中的数字序列生成任务。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation
tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply
cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences.
This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this
gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical
values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy
between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves
numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive
experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在系统性泛化方面表现不佳，尤其是在新上下文中处理已知概念时。缺乏衡量问题难度的标准是研究的动机。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过序列到序列任务中组成部分的熵来量化系统性泛化的难度，并测试不同模型架构的性能。

Result: 发现模型性能与熵呈正相关，高熵任务无需内置先验即可成功，低熵任务可作为系统性泛化进展的评估目标。

Conclusion: 研究将系统性泛化与信息效率联系起来，为评估模型在系统性泛化方面的进展提供了新视角。

Abstract: Systematic generalization remains challenging for current language models,
which are known to be both sensitive to semantically similar permutations of
the input and to struggle with known concepts presented in novel contexts.
Although benchmarks exist for assessing compositional behavior, it is unclear
how to measure the difficulty of a systematic generalization problem. In this
work, we show how one aspect of systematic generalization can be described by
the entropy of the distribution of component parts in the training data. We
formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and
find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the
entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency,
and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even
without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target
for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前研究关于语言多样性在LLM微调中效果的矛盾结论。

Method: 通过132个翻译方向的受控微调实验，系统分析语言多样性的影响。

Result: 语言多样性提升翻译质量（包括无监督和监督对），并生成更语言无关的表示。

Conclusion: 语言多样性通过优化表示提升性能，但需注意阈值以避免负面效果。

Abstract: Prior research diverges on language diversity in LLM fine-tuning: Some
studies report benefits while others find no advantages. Through controlled
fine-tuning experiments across 132 translation directions, we systematically
resolve these disparities. We find that expanding language diversity during
fine-tuning improves translation quality for both unsupervised and --
surprisingly -- supervised pairs, despite less diverse models being fine-tuned
exclusively on these supervised pairs. However, benefits plateau or decrease
beyond a certain diversity threshold. We show that increased language diversity
creates more language-agnostic representations. These representational
adaptations help explain the improved performance in models fine-tuned with
greater diversity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TREA的新型数据集，用于评估大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在时序推理任务上的表现，并发现现有模型与人类能力存在差距。同时，论文提出了一种不确定性度量方法，用于评估模型对输入语义扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态社区希望结合文本、视觉和音频等模态以实现类似文本大语言模型（LLM）的成功。为此，需要评估LALMs在推理任务上的表现，而不仅仅是分类或生成任务。

Method: 提出TREA数据集，用于评估LALMs在时序推理任务上的表现，并设计了一种不确定性度量方法，衡量模型对输入语义扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 开源LALMs在TREA数据集上的表现普遍低于人类水平。此外，准确性指标与不确定性指标并不一定相关。

Conclusion: 论文强调了对LALMs进行全面评估的重要性，尤其是在高风险应用中，需要同时考虑准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined
the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like
vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In
this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on
reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or
generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal
reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).
  We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind
human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we
also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model
to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that
the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus,
points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes
applications.

Abstract: Despite the prominence of decoder-only language models, encoders remain
crucial for resource-constrained applications. We introduce ModernGBERT (134M,

incorporating architectural innovations from ModernBERT. To evaluate the
practical trade-offs of training encoders from scratch, we also present
LL\"aMmlein2Vec (120M, 1B, 7B), a family of encoders derived from German

results show that ModernGBERT 1B outperforms prior state-of-the-art German

Motivation: 理解LLMs如何将知识从一种语言泛化至其他语言，并解决其输出不一致的问题。

Method: 应用logit lens分析LLMs在多语言多选推理问题中的隐式步骤，并研究模型隐藏状态与共享语义空间的关系。

Result: LLMs依赖单语言子空间导致预测不一致；大模型隐藏状态更易脱离共享表示，但跨语言检索能力更强；引导至共享语义空间可提升多语言推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过强化共享语义空间利用，可改善LLMs的多语言推理能力和输出一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual
transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same
queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are
able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the
logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual
multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are
less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather
than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more
multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from
the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more
capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally,
we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models'
latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing
utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning
performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output
consistency with English.

Result: 传统欺骗线索相关性低且不一致，模型在DeFaBel上表现接近随机，挑战欺骗检测的现有假设。

Conclusion: 欺骗难以仅通过语言线索可靠检测，需重新思考NLP中欺骗研究的方法和数据收集。

Abstract: Can deception be detected solely from written text? Cues of deceptive
communication are inherently subtle, even more so in text-only communication.
Yet, prior studies have reported considerable success in automatic deception
detection. We hypothesize that such findings are largely driven by artifacts
introduced during data collection and do not generalize beyond specific
datasets. We revisit this assumption by introducing a belief-based deception
framework, which defines deception as a misalignment between an author's claims
and true beliefs, irrespective of factual accuracy, allowing deception cues to
be studied in isolation. Based on this framework, we construct three corpora,
collectively referred to as DeFaBel, including a German-language corpus of
deceptive and non-deceptive arguments and a multilingual version in German and
English, each collected under varying conditions to account for belief change
and enable cross-linguistic analysis. Using these corpora, we evaluate commonly
reported linguistic cues of deception. Across all three DeFaBel variants, these
cues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception
labels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We
further benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar
data collection protocols. While some show statistically significant
correlations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive
cues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection
using feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned
large language models. While some models perform well on established deception
datasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings
challenge the assumption that deception can be reliably inferred from
linguistic cues and call for rethinking how deception is studied and modeled in
NLP.

Conclusion: Tianyi作为中医AI助手，成功填补了中医知识与实际应用之间的鸿沟，具有重要的临床和研究价值。

Abstract: Natural medicines, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are
gaining global recognition for their therapeutic potential in addressing human
symptoms and diseases. TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive
practical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the
effective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination
of treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of
clinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine
learning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective
constraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack
specialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model
scale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we
introduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and
specifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM
corpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and
knowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and
systematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally,
we establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in
TCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and
real-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant
potential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research,
bridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型对训练数据的记忆行为及其潜在的版权风险。

Method: 预训练不同规模的模型（1B/3B/8B），混合公共领域书籍和网络数据，模拟受控频率的版权内容。

Result: 发现位置偏移效应：短前缀触发记忆最强，偏移初始位置会显著降低记忆；模型对初始位置敏感。

Conclusion: 位置偏移是评估记忆风险的关键因素，偏移敏感数据可减少记忆和文本退化。

Abstract: Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data,
posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we
pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing
web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at
controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We
thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key
findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short
prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization
decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp
decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of
the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely
disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval
anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that
when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces
degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive
data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization
and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and
previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work
implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training
sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on
natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit,
Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual
zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and
machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than
fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle,
especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on
Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that
incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly
boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for
smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an
important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models
used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical
languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these
languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolSpectrum是一个评估LLMs在个性化工具选择中能力的基准，强调用户画像和环境因素的重要性。实验表明个性化工具选择能显著提升用户体验，但现有LLMs在联合推理这两方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具选择方法忽视了上下文感知的个性化，导致用户满意度低和工具利用效率不足。

Method: 提出ToolSpectrum基准，形式化用户画像和环境因素两个维度，分析其对工具选择的影响。

Result: 个性化工具选择显著改善用户体验，但现有LLMs在联合推理用户画像和环境因素时表现有限。

Conclusion: 上下文感知个性化对工具增强的LLMs至关重要，当前模型在联合推理方面存在明显不足。

Abstract: While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances
their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services,
existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user
instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection.
This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool
utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection
based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool
utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization,
user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and
synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on
ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly
improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even
state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user
profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the
expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware
personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for
current models. Our data and code are available at

TL;DR: SLED是一种通过将语音波形编码为连续潜在表示序列，并使用能量距离目标自回归建模的语音语言建模方法。它避免了离散化误差，简化了建模流程，并在零样本和流式语音合成中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型依赖残差向量量化和复杂的分层架构，导致离散化误差和建模复杂性。SLED旨在通过连续潜在表示和能量距离目标解决这些问题。

Method: SLED将语音波形编码为连续潜在表示序列，并采用能量距离目标进行自回归建模，避免了残差向量量化和分层架构。

Result: 实验结果表明，SLED在零样本和流式语音合成中表现优异，展示了其在通用语音语言模型中的潜力。

Conclusion: SLED通过简化建模流程并避免离散化误差，为语音语言建模提供了一种高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by
encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations
and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The
energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by
contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to
capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing
reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and
eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in
existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline
while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference
efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance
in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for
broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法依赖训练实现对齐，成本较高，本文旨在通过训练无关方法提升对齐效果。

Method: 提出对齐采样和灵活验证策略，利用预填充阶段的输出分布生成对齐候选，并通过自适应概率阈值优化验证。

Result: 在8个数据集上实验显示，生成分数平均提升3.3分，接受长度达2.39，生成速度提升2.23倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了生成效率和质量，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in
accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models.
The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates
and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve
draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa,
involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a
training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose
alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the
prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit
from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple
yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability
threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving
inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering,
summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the
average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method
achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率提升至少2.51%，宏F1提升1.63%。

Conclusion: 框架为古典诗歌情感分析和多模态中文表示研究提供了新思路，并开源代码以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Classical Chinese poetry is a vital and enduring part of Chinese literature,
conveying profound emotional resonance. Existing studies analyze sentiment
based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features
inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by
Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal
framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract
sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from
multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features,
enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level
visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features
enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation
learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public
datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro
F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide
insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.

Result: 评估揭示了LLMs在解决种子科学实际问题中的显著差距。

Conclusion: SeedBench为LLMs在种子设计领域的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Seed science is essential for modern agriculture, directly influencing crop
yields and global food security. However, challenges such as interdisciplinary
complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a
shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their
application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital
resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench -- the first multi-task
benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration
with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key
aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific
fine-tuned models. Our findings not only highlight the substantial gaps between
the power of LLMs and the real-world seed science problems, but also make a
foundational step for research on LLMs for seed design.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of global digitalization, users from different
countries increasingly rely on social media for information exchange. In this
context, multilingual multi-label emotion detection has emerged as a critical
research area. This study addresses SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection. Our paper focuses on two sub-tracks of this task:
(1) Track A: Multi-label emotion detection, and (2) Track B: Emotion intensity.
To tackle multilingual challenges, we leverage pre-trained multilingual models
and focus on two architectures: (1) a fine-tuned BERT-based classification
model and (2) an instruction-tuned generative LLM. Additionally, we propose two
methods for handling multi-label classification: the base method, which maps an
input directly to all its corresponding emotion labels, and the pairwise
method, which models the relationship between the input text and each emotion
category individually. Experimental results demonstrate the strong
generalization ability of our approach in multilingual emotion recognition. In
Track A, our method achieved Top 4 performance across 10 languages, ranking 1st
in Hindi. In Track B, our approach also secured Top 5 performance in 7
languages, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness\footnote{Our code is

Method: 主张从计算解决方案转向社会方法，借鉴语言学和社会学知识，结合社区、政策制定者等多方力量。

Result: 提出语言学家和NLP研究者可通过社会方法解决数字空间问题，促进公平的数字包容。

Conclusion: 语言学和NLP研究在解决数字社会问题中具有重要潜力，需与多方合作以实现社会影响。

Abstract: The advent of the internet has been both a blessing and a curse for once
marginalised communities. When used well, the internet can be used to connect
and establish communities crossing different intersections; however, it can
also be used as a tool to alienate people and communities as well as perpetuate
hate, misinformation, and disinformation especially on social media platforms.
We propose steering hate speech research and researchers away from pre-existing
computational solutions and consider social methods to inform social solutions
to address this social problem. In a similar way linguistics research can
inform language planning policy, linguists should apply what we know about
language and society to mitigate some of the emergent risks and dangers of
anti-social behaviour in digital spaces. We argue linguists and NLP researchers
can play a principle role in unleashing the social impact potential of
linguistics research working alongside communities, advocates, activists, and
policymakers to enable equitable digital inclusion and to close the digital
divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实生活中的文本规划任务（如会议安排）对LLMs提出了挑战，尤其是在复杂度高的情况下。研究旨在系统评估闭源和开源模型在生成程序代码方面的表现。

Method: 研究比较了闭源和开源模型，包括那些在推理时根据复杂度扩展输出长度的模型，生成Python代码和约束满足问题求解器代码的能力。

Result: 尽管任务具有算法性质，编程通常优于规划，但生成的代码在鲁棒性和效率方面存在问题，影响了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明编程在复杂规划任务中具有潜力，但生成的代码需要改进以提高鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Real-life textual planning tasks such as meeting scheduling have posed much
challenge to LLMs especially when the complexity is high. While previous work
primarily studied auto-regressive generation of plans with closed-source
models, we systematically evaluate both closed- and open-source models,
including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in
generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not
only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction
problem solver. Despite the algorithmic nature of the task, we show that
programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error
analysis also indicates a lack of robustness and efficiency in the generated
code that hinders generalization.

TL;DR: HeteroSpec是一种异构自适应的推测解码框架，通过动态优化计算资源分配，显著提升大型语言模型（LLM）的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是LLM推理的标准方法，但其顺序性导致效率瓶颈。现有推测解码算法未能充分利用语言复杂性的异构性，导致资源分配不优。

Method: 提出HeteroSpec框架，包括：1）基于累积元路径Top-K熵的预测上下文识别；2）基于数据驱动熵分区的动态资源分配策略。

Result: 在五个公共基准和四个模型上测试，平均加速4.26倍，优于现有EAGLE-3方法。

Conclusion: HeteroSpec无需重新训练草稿模型，开销低，且与其他加速技术正交，为上下文感知的LLM推理加速提供了新范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding, the standard approach for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference, remains a significant bottleneck due to its sequential nature. While
speculative decoding algorithms mitigate this inefficiency through parallel
verification, they fail to exploit the inherent heterogeneity in linguistic
complexity, a key factor leading to suboptimal resource allocation. We address
this by proposing HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding
framework that dynamically optimizes computational resource allocation based on
linguistic context complexity. HeteroSpec introduces two key mechanisms: (1) A
novel cumulative meta-path Top-$K$ entropy metric for efficiently identifying
predictable contexts. (2) A dynamic resource allocation strategy based on
data-driven entropy partitioning, enabling adaptive speculative expansion and
pruning tailored to local context difficulty. Evaluated on five public
benchmarks and four models, HeteroSpec achieves an average speedup of
4.26$\times$. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3 across
speedup rates, average acceptance length, and verification cost. Notably,
HeteroSpec requires no draft model retraining, incurs minimal overhead, and is
orthogonal to other acceleration techniques. It demonstrates enhanced
acceleration with stronger draft models, establishing a new paradigm for
context-aware LLM inference acceleration.

Method: 引入WikiPersona数据集，通过生成可验证的文本描述和偏好对齐，评估不同个性化方法，提出基于推断偏好的前缀方法。

Result: 发现少样本提示和微调效果不佳，而基于推断偏好的前缀方法在偏好冲突时表现更好，且能更公平地泛化到未知人物。

Conclusion: 推断偏好的前缀方法在个性化对齐中更有效，尤其在偏好冲突和泛化能力方面表现突出。

Abstract: Preference alignment has become a standard pipeline in finetuning models to
follow \emph{generic} human preferences. Majority of work seeks to optimize
model to produce responses that would be preferable \emph{on average},
simplifying the diverse and often \emph{contradicting} space of human
preferences. While research has increasingly focused on personalized alignment:
adapting models to individual user preferences, there is a lack of personalized
preference dataset which focus on nuanced individual-level preferences. To
address this, we introduce WikiPersona: the first fine-grained personalization
using well-documented, famous individuals. Our dataset challenges models to
align with these personas through an interpretable process: generating
verifiable textual descriptions of a persona's background and preferences in
addition to alignment. We systematically evaluate different personalization
approaches and find that as few-shot prompting with preferences and fine-tuning
fail to simultaneously ensure effectiveness and efficiency, using
\textit{inferred personal preferences} as prefixes enables effective
personalization, especially in topics where preferences clash while leading to
more equitable generalization across unseen personas.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains.
However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are
still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly
focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the
generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning
and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved
content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of
interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA
(Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator
framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards.
Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our
RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform
structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces.
Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments
with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30%
improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA
Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses
show that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without
extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.

Motivation: 语音反馈在对话系统中对确保共同理解至关重要，但其韵律和词汇形式共同传递意义。

Method: 通过三元比较任务测量参与者对反馈的感知相似性，并评估不同语音表征的表现。

Result: 频谱和自监督语音表征在编码韵律方面优于提取的音高特征，尤其是同说话者的反馈。对比学习可进一步优化表征。

Conclusion: 语音表征能有效捕捉韵律相似性，对比学习可提升其与人类感知的对齐。

Abstract: Vocal feedback (e.g., `mhm', `yeah', `okay') is an important component of
spoken dialogue and is crucial to ensuring common ground in conversational
systems. The exact meaning of such feedback is conveyed through both lexical
and prosodic form. In this work, we investigate the perceived prosodic
similarity of vocal feedback with the same lexical form, and to what extent
existing speech representations reflect such similarities. A triadic comparison
task with recruited participants is used to measure perceived similarity of
feedback responses taken from two different datasets. We find that spectral and
self-supervised speech representations encode prosody better than extracted
pitch features, especially in the case of feedback from the same speaker. We
also find that it is possible to further condense and align the representations
to human perception through contrastive learning.

Motivation: 现有方法（如自一致性和自校正）在提升SQL生成准确性时存在局限性，如自一致性可能选择次优输出，自校正仅解决语法错误。

Method: 提出CSC-SQL，结合自一致性和自校正，选择高频输出并通过修正模型优化，同时使用GRPO算法通过强化学习微调模型。

Result: 在BIRD开发集上，3B模型达到65.28%执行准确率，7B模型达到69.19%。

Conclusion: CSC-SQL有效整合了两种方法的优势，显著提升了SQL生成质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL
queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency
and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing
computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable
limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority
votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To
leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method
that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two
most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a
merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and
revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output
quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of
CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution
accuracy, while the 7B model achieves 69.19%. The code will be open sourced at

Conclusion: LORex在分类法扩展中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation
systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is
essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models
struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative
methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding
context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We
propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for
Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines
discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy
expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into
batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning
candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments
across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy
by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of
information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear.
We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to
reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how
persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support
this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a
jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from
VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;
and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired
with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across
model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for
true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this
effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas
Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the
tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual
misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model
behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and
mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems. Code and dataset are

*Qiguang Chen,Libo Qin,Jinhao Liu,Yue Liao,Jiaqi Wang,Jingxuan Zhou,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Reasoning Boundary Framework++ (RBF++)，用于解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)推理中的两个主要挑战：量化评估和优化可测量边界，以及处理不可测量边界（如多模态感知）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT推理在实际应用中面临两大挑战：缺乏量化指标和可操作指南来评估和优化可测量边界，以及无法评估不可测量边界（如多模态感知）。

Method: 提出RBF++框架，定义推理边界（RB）作为CoT性能的上限，并提出组合定律和常数假设来处理可测量和不可测量边界。此外，引入推理边界划分机制，将不可测量边界划分为两个子边界。

Result: 在13个任务中验证了38个模型，证明了框架在跨模态场景中的可行性。评估了10种CoT策略，并从两个互补角度提供了优化和衰减的见解。

Conclusion: RBF++框架为理解和优化LLM中的推理边界提供了新方法，推动了CoT推理的研究。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large
language models (LLMs) on complex tasks, spurring research into its underlying
mechanisms. However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:
(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating
and optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of
methods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal
perception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary
Framework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning
boundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a
combination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable
guidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in
multimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces
unmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the
reasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two
sub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both
unmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive
experiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our
framework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies,
offer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives,
and expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning. We hope
this work advances the understanding of RBs and optimization strategies in
LLMs. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GUARD的框架，通过在生成时动态遗忘特定知识，避免了对模型性能的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在记忆大量知识方面表现出色，但选择性遗忘特定知识对模型的安全性和合规性至关重要。现有方法通常通过微调实现遗忘，但会模糊知识边界并影响性能。

Method: GUARD框架在生成时动态检测遗忘目标，并通过自适应限制和检测技术防止模型生成相关内容。具体包括提示分类器检测目标和动态惩罚候选标记。

Result: 实验结果表明，GUARD在多种任务中实现了高质量的遗忘，同时对模型的通用能力几乎没有影响。

Conclusion: GUARD在遗忘和模型性能之间取得了良好的平衡，为LLMs的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
memorizing vast amounts of knowledge across diverse domains. However, the
ability to selectively forget specific knowledge is critical for ensuring the
safety and compliance of deployed models. Existing unlearning efforts typically
fine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a
calibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary
between forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of
overall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be
better to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against
generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the
fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning
via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables
dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a
prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding
forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens
during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching,
effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content.
Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry
Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on
the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across
various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general
capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多轮对话数据集DialogTool和一个虚拟移动评估环境VirtualMobile，用于评估语言模型在多轮状态化工具交互中的表现，发现现有先进模型在长期工具使用上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮或无状态交互，忽视了多轮应用中状态化交互的重要性，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DialogTool数据集和VirtualMobile评估环境，覆盖工具使用的全生命周期（创建、利用、角色一致响应），并对13种开源和闭源LLM进行全面评估。

Result: 现有先进LLM在长期工具使用任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有模型在多轮状态化工具交互中的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that assess Language Models (LMs) as Language Agents
(LAs) for tool use primarily focus on stateless, single-turn interactions or
partial evaluations, such as tool selection in a single turn, overlooking the
inherent stateful nature of interactions in multi-turn applications. To fulfill
this gap, we propose \texttt{DialogTool}, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with
stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across
six key tasks in three stages: 1) \textit{tool creation}; 2) \textit{tool
utilization}: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3)
\textit{role-consistent response}: response generation and role play.
Furthermore, we build \texttt{VirtualMobile} -- an embodied virtual mobile
evaluation environment to simulate API calls and assess the robustness of the
created APIs\footnote{We will use tools and APIs alternatively, there are no
significant differences between them in this paper.}. Taking advantage of these
artifacts, we conduct comprehensive evaluation on 13 distinct open- and
closed-source LLMs and provide detailed analysis at each stage, revealing that
the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well to use tools over
long horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音-LLM在上下文推理和副语言理解方面能力有限，缺乏覆盖这两方面的QA数据集。

Method: 提出了一种框架，包括基于伪副语言标签的数据浓缩和基于LLM的上下文副语言QA生成。

Result: 验证了框架生成的数据集与人工生成数据集的相关性，并揭示了语音-LLM在共情推理中的不足。

Conclusion: 该框架是首创，有望用于训练更具鲁棒性的语音-LLM，提升副语言推理能力。

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning
alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of
Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel
framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates
contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo
paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and
LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is
validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct
model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset.
The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic
reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust
models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in
training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，传统的人工评估效率低下，自动评估成为趋势。然而，现有LLM评估模型在复杂推理领域表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）训练评估模型，提出EIS-GRPO算法解决位置偏差问题，并开发了ReasoningJudgeBench基准和新模型J4R。

Result: J4R模型在JudgeBench和ReasoningJudgeBench上表现优于GPT-4o和其他小型评估模型，性能提升6.7%和9%。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习和新算法，论文成功提升了LLM在复杂推理领域的评估能力，为自动评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM)
development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming
human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with
assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class
of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains,
like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model
responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing
judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning
(RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial
State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us
to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex
evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that
evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3)
We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that
outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or
exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and
ReasoningJudgeBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM作为评估者具有可扩展性和成本效益，但其可靠性和安全性（尤其是对抗性操作的鲁棒性）仍存疑。

Method: 使用Greedy Coordinate Gradient（GCG）方法生成对抗性后缀，攻击LLM评估系统，并在MT-Bench数据集上测试开源LLM（Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct和Falcon3-3B-Instruct）。

Result: CUA攻击成功率超过30%，JMA也表现出显著效果，表明当前LLM评估系统存在严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前LLM-as-a-Judge系统易受攻击，需开发更鲁棒的防御机制并进一步研究对抗性评估和可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators
(LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This
paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human
annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly
their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns.
This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to
prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the
judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies:
Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision
output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the
model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG)
optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the
responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments
dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and
Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable
effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current
LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and
further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based
assessment frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在代码推理中利用长上下文的能力，区分了词汇代码召回和语义代码召回，并提出SemTrace技术衡量语义召回。实验发现LLM在代码片段位于输入上下文中间时推理准确性显著下降，且词汇召回与语义召回机制不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在代码推理中利用长上下文的有效性，以及词汇召回与语义召回的关系。

Method: 提出SemTrace技术衡量语义召回，并量化现有基准的语义召回敏感性。

Result: LLM在代码片段位于输入中间时推理准确性下降，词汇召回与语义召回机制不同，现有基准可能低估LLM的挑战。

Conclusion: 当前代码推理基准可能低估了LLM在利用上下文信息时的挑战，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large
contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning
remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code
snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability.
Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval)
and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic
recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of
specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also
present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing
benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop
in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input
context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like
SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with
models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall.
Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting
different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current
code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity,
potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context
information.

Method: 通过分析提示未充分指定的现象，提出需求感知提示优化机制，并验证其效果。

Result: 未充分指定的提示在模型或提示变化时性能下降2倍，新机制平均提升性能4.8%。

Conclusion: 有效管理提示未充分指定需包括需求发现、评估和监控的完整流程。

Abstract: Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their
requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently
underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In
this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification,
showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by
default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more
likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops
by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a
prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited
instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard
prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel
requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance
by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the
prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing
prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive
requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在所有查询中使用复杂推理导致的低效问题，探索模型是否能学习何时需要深入思考。

Method: 提出Thinkless框架，结合强化学习与DeGRPO算法，通过控制令牌选择推理模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Thinkless减少了50%-90%的长链推理使用，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: Thinkless成功实现了推理语言模型的高效自适应推理，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,
have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical
inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results
in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems
admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs
learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable
framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and
long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.
Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two
control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed
reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy
Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of
hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the
selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the
accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables
fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing
training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.
Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and
GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -
90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models. The

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning language model outputs with human
preferences, yet existing approaches often lack both controllability and
interpretability. These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives,
limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their
scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To
address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework
that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and
provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent
and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with
diverse human values and use cases. Our models, data, and code are available as

Abstract: The paradigm of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) as evaluative judges has emerged as an effective
approach in RLHF and inference-time scaling. In this work, we propose
Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering
general-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of
directly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process
as a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model
first conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses
and eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not
only improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances
the performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored
responses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation:
1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate
and prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2)
Text-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline
for distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model,
which is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability
via warm up supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our MR. Judge
is effective across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, our MR. Judge-7B
surpasses GPT-4o by 9.9% on VL-RewardBench, and improves performance on MM-Vet
during inference-time scaling by up to 7.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但冗长的思考过程增加了推理开销。研究发现，对于简单任务，跳过思考直接生成解决方案（NoThinking）在性能和效率上更优。

Conclusion: AdaptThink通过自适应选择思考模式，有效平衡了推理质量和效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on
various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy
thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency
a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,
which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the
final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both
performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel
RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode
adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two
core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the
model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an
importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples
during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model
to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our
experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs
while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets,
AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
by 53% and improves its accuracy by 2.4%, highlighting the promise of adaptive
thinking-mode selection for optimizing the balance between reasoning quality
and efficiency. Our codes and models are available at

is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making
that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through
language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to
non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text
was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable
method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features
representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model
human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis
reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a
narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a
richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical
patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently
overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the
insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the
linguistic signs that matter.

TL;DR: SMOTExT是一种将SMOTE技术应用于文本数据的新方法，通过BERT嵌入插值和xRAG架构生成合成文本，解决数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NLP模型在专业领域或低资源环境中因数据稀缺和类别不平衡导致的训练困难。

Method: 利用BERT嵌入插值生成新的潜在点，并通过xRAG架构将其解码为连贯文本。

Result: 初步实验显示，该方法在知识蒸馏和数据增强方面潜力显著，且生成的合成数据训练模型性能接近原始数据。

Conclusion: SMOTExT为低资源学习和隐私保护机器学习提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Data scarcity and class imbalance are persistent challenges in training
robust NLP models, especially in specialized domains or low-resource settings.
We propose a novel technique, SMOTExT, that adapts the idea of Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) to textual data. Our method generates new
synthetic examples by interpolating between BERT-based embeddings of two
existing examples and then decoding the resulting latent point into text with
xRAG architecture. By leveraging xRAG's cross-modal retrieval-generation
framework, we can effectively turn interpolated vectors into coherent text.
While this is preliminary work supported by qualitative outputs only, the
method shows strong potential for knowledge distillation and data augmentation
in few-shot settings. Notably, our approach also shows promise for
privacy-preserving machine learning: in early experiments, training models
solely on generated data achieved comparable performance to models trained on
the original dataset. This suggests a viable path toward safe and effective
learning under data protection constraints.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在图表理解中的挑战，指出其在视觉推理能力上的不足，并提出了新的基准测试ChartMuseum，揭示了模型与人类表现的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在图表理解中表现出视觉与文本推理能力的不平衡，尤其是在复杂视觉推理任务中表现不佳，需要新的评估工具来推动模型改进。

Method: 通过合成数据集和真实世界图表构建的ChartMuseum基准测试，评估模型在多种推理类型上的表现，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 人类在基准测试中达到93%准确率，而最佳模型Gemini-2.5-Pro仅63.0%，开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct仅38.5%。视觉推理问题中，模型性能下降35%-55%。

Conclusion: ChartMuseum基准测试有效揭示了LVLMs在视觉推理上的不足，为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language
models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and
visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable
imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is
difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset
solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades
significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance
remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering
(QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple
reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources,
specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike
prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly
and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model
and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities:
although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro
attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual
reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from
text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error
analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging
for current LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升语言模型与用户意图的对齐能力，使用户能够更灵活地控制生成内容的属性（如长度、复杂度、情感等）。

Method: 通过微调语言模型，利用连续控制信号（如向量插值）来控制生成行为，以响应长度为例进行案例研究。

Result: 该方法在控制生成内容长度方面比上下文学习或离散信号方法更可靠。

Conclusion: 连续控制信号为语言模型的行为控制提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant
to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow
users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example,
controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that
gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate
users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or
discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this
work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist
along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or
via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in
controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we
demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be
controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a
"low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts
response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods
that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂决策环境中对选择架构（如默认选项、提示等）表现出更高的敏感性，且与人类行为存在差异。简单的提示策略可调整选择分布，但无法消除敏感性。行为测试对模型部署至关重要。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨LLM在复杂决策环境中的行为分布及其对选择架构的敏感性，为模型部署提供依据。

Method: 通过多属性表格决策问题，研究LLM在默认选项、提示等架构下的行为，并测试零-shot CoT和少-shot提示策略的效果。

Result: LLM对选择架构更敏感，与人类行为存在差异；提示策略可调整选择分布，但无法消除敏感性；优化架构可提升部分模型性能。

Conclusion: 行为测试是部署LLM作为代理或助手前的必要步骤，以确保其在复杂环境中的适应性。

Abstract: LLMs are being set loose in complex, real-world environments involving
sequential decision-making and tool use. Often, this involves making choices on
behalf of human users. However, not much is known about the distribution of
such choices, and how susceptible they are to different choice architectures.
We perform a case study with a few such LLM models on a multi-attribute tabular
decision-making problem, under canonical nudges such as the default option,
suggestions, and information highlighting, as well as additional prompting
strategies. We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice
distributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they
show much higher susceptibility to the nudges. Second, they diverge in points
earned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes.
Third, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring
substantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing
any. Moreover, we show that simple prompt strategies like zero-shot chain of
thought (CoT) can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with
human data can induce greater alignment. Yet, none of these methods resolve the
sensitivity of these models to nudges. Finally, we show how optimal nudges
optimized with a human resource-rational model can similarly increase LLM
performance for some models. All these findings suggest that behavioral tests
are needed before deploying models as agents or assistants acting on behalf of
users in complex environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的多义性（polysemanticity）现象，并通过稀疏自编码器技术分析了小型模型的多义结构及其对模型安全性的影响。研究发现这种结构可以被利用来干预更大的黑盒模型，表明多义性可能在不同架构和训练方式中普遍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多义性是大型神经网络中普遍存在的现象，但其对模型安全性的影响尚不清楚。研究旨在探索多义性结构及其潜在的安全风险。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器技术分析Pythia-70M和GPT-2-Small的多义结构，并评估其在提示、特征、标记和神经元层面的脆弱性。

Result: 研究发现两种模型具有一致的多义拓扑结构，并证明这种结构可用于干预更大的黑盒模型（如LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct）。

Conclusion: 多义性结构具有普遍性和可迁移性，可能在不同架构和训练方式中稳定存在，这对模型安全性和可解释性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated
features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains
a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same
time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging
recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic
structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their
vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token,
and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology
shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can
be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box
instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These
findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also
point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could
potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.

Conclusion: Heart2Mind展示了可穿戴技术与可解释人工智能（XAI）结合在心理疾病诊断中的可行性，实现了透明且可争议的诊断系统。

Abstract: Psychiatric disorders affect millions globally, yet their diagnosis faces
significant challenges in clinical practice due to subjective assessments and
accessibility concerns, leading to potential delays in treatment. To help
address this issue, we present Heart2Mind, a human-centered contestable
psychiatric disorder diagnosis system using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitors. Our approach leverages cardiac biomarkers, particularly heart rate
variability (HRV) and R-R intervals (RRI) time series, as objective indicators
of autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric conditions. The system comprises three
key components: (1) a Cardiac Monitoring Interface (CMI) for real-time data
acquisition from Polar H9/H10 devices; (2) a Multi-Scale Temporal-Frequency
Transformer (MSTFT) that processes RRI time series through integrated
time-frequency domain analysis; (3) a Contestable Diagnosis Interface (CDI)
combining Self-Adversarial Explanations (SAEs) with contestable Large Language
Models (LLMs). Our MSTFT achieves 91.7% accuracy on the HRV-ACC dataset using
leave-one-out cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SAEs
successfully detect inconsistencies in model predictions by comparing
attention-based and gradient-based explanations, while LLMs enable clinicians
to validate correct predictions and contest erroneous ones. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable technology with Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent,
contestable system for psychiatric diagnosis that maintains clinical oversight
while leveraging advanced AI capabilities. Our implementation is publicly
available at: https://github.com/Analytics-Everywhere-Lab/heart2mind.

Motivation: 尽管神经网络模型在预测人类行为方面表现优异，但缺乏对认知过程的可解释性。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用基于结果的强化学习，引导LLMs生成显式推理痕迹以解释人类的冒险选择。

Result: 该方法在提供高质量解释的同时，实现了对人类决策的强定量预测。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs可作为双用途认知模型，兼具预测准确性和解释能力。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive modeling is to develop models that not only
predict human behavior but also provide insight into the underlying cognitive
mechanisms. While neural network models trained on large-scale behavioral data
often achieve strong predictive performance, they typically fall short in
offering interpretable explanations of the cognitive processes they capture. In
this work, we explore the potential of pretrained large language models (LLMs)
to serve as dual-purpose cognitive models--capable of both accurate prediction
and interpretable explanation in natural language. Specifically, we employ
reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards to guide LLMs toward
generating explicit reasoning traces for explaining human risky choices. Our
findings demonstrate that this approach produces high-quality explanations
alongside strong quantitative predictions of human decisions.

Conclusion: STARK为智能CPS的模型架构和推理范式创新提供了框架，揭示了LLMs和LRMs在时空推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains
underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning
benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of
reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables,
localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning
over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and
world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge
(e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct
spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552
challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter.
Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks
requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation),
particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust
performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or
surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in
reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and
LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model
continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result
attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK
motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for
intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in
the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

intermediate representation with Python syntax that facilitates final
conversion into widely adopted business process definition languages, such as

evaluate the components of FLOW-GEN across eight LLMs of varying sizes. We hope
that FLOW-GEN and FLOW-BENCH catalyze further research in BPA making it more

Motivation: 人类在解决复杂问题时能自然分解任务并动态调整计划，而现有RL代理（如PPO）缺乏这种能力，需要更多训练步骤。研究目标是让RL代理具备类似人类的先验知识。

Method: 提出Dylan框架，结合符号规划与强化学习，动态调整奖励函数并指导代理完成子任务，同时避免符号规划的常见问题（如无限循环）。

Result: 实验表明，Dylan显著提升了RL代理的性能，并增强了其在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Dylan通过引入人类先验知识，有效提升了RL代理的效率和适应性，为复杂任务的学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: When tackling complex problems, humans naturally break them down into
smaller, manageable subtasks and adjust their initial plans based on
observations. For instance, if you want to make coffee at a friend's place, you
might initially plan to grab coffee beans, go to the coffee machine, and pour
them into the machine. Upon noticing that the machine is full, you would skip
the initial steps and proceed directly to brewing. In stark contrast, state of
the art reinforcement learners, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
lack such prior knowledge and therefore require significantly more training
steps to exhibit comparable adaptive behavior. Thus, a central research
question arises: \textit{How can we enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents
to have similar ``human priors'', allowing the agent to learn with fewer
training interactions?} To address this challenge, we propose differentiable
symbolic planner (Dylan), a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning
into Reinforcement Learning. Dylan serves as a reward model that dynamically
shapes rewards by leveraging human priors, guiding agents through intermediate
subtasks, thus enabling more efficient exploration. Beyond reward shaping,
Dylan can work as a high level planner that composes primitive policies to
generate new behaviors while avoiding common symbolic planner pitfalls such as
infinite execution loops. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dylan
significantly improves RL agents' performance and facilitates generalization to
unseen tasks.

Motivation: 高维状态POMDP中准确表示信念具有挑战性，传统方法难以应对。

Result: cDGMs在信念准确性和规划性能上均优于粒子滤波基线方法。

Conclusion: cDGMs为高维状态POMDP提供了一种有效的信念表示方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are used to model a
wide range of applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
subsurface problems. However, accurately representing the belief is difficult
for POMDPs with high-dimensional states. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that uses conditional deep generative models (cDGMs) to represent the
belief. Unlike traditional belief representations, cDGMs are well-suited for
high-dimensional states and large numbers of observations, and they can
generate an arbitrary number of samples from the posterior belief. We train the
cDGMs on data produced by random rollout trajectories and show their
effectiveness in solving a mineral exploration POMDP with a large and
continuous state space. The cDGMs outperform particle filter baselines in both
task-agnostic measures of belief accuracy as well as in planning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型流程中自动化决策逻辑的潜力受限于提示策略和质量，而DMN提供了一种标准化、用户友好的图形化方法。

Method: 引入DMN引导的提示框架，将复杂决策逻辑分解为小模块，并在研究生课程中实施，以作业和DMN模型为输入生成反馈。

Result: 框架表现优于CoT提示，学生反馈显示高感知有用性。

Conclusion: DMN引导的提示框架有效提升了LLMs在决策逻辑中的表现，用户体验良好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable potential in automating
decision logic within knowledge-intensive processes. However, their
effectiveness largely depends on the strategy and quality of prompting. Since
decision logic is typically embedded in prompts, it becomes challenging for end
users to modify or refine it. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) offers a
standardized graphical approach for defining decision logic in a structured,
user-friendly manner. This paper introduces a DMN-guided prompting framework
that breaks down complex decision logic into smaller, manageable components,
guiding LLMs through structured decision pathways. We implemented the framework
in a graduate-level course where students submitted assignments. The
assignments and DMN models representing feedback instructions served as inputs
to our framework. The instructor evaluated the generated feedback and labeled
it for performance assessment. Our approach demonstrated promising results,
outperforming chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Students also responded
positively to the generated feedback, reporting high levels of perceived
usefulness in a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多目标强化学习的推理LLM（REMOR），用于改进AI同行评审系统，生成更高质量的反馈。通过设计多方面的奖励函数，并结合高质量评审数据集PeerRT，REMOR在性能上显著优于现有AI和人类评审。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI同行评审系统生成的反馈往往流于表面且过度赞扬，无法与人类评审的质量相比。本文旨在通过多目标强化学习训练推理LLM（REMOR）来克服这些局限性。

Method: 1. 设计多方面的奖励函数（HPRR），与人类评审标准对齐；2. 使用PeerRT数据集对DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B进行监督微调；3. 应用GRPO训练两种模型：REMOR-H（人类对齐奖励）和REMOR-U（均匀奖励）。

Result: REMOR-U和REMOR-H的平均奖励是现有AI系统、商业LLM基线及人类评审的两倍以上。REMOR避免了人类评审中的低质量长尾问题，且最佳AI评审与人类评审质量相当。

Conclusion: 推理能力是实现改进的关键。论文发布了HPRR奖励函数、PeerRT数据集和REMOR模型，以推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising
suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning
LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome
these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that
aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review
itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and
the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality
top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the
human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the
human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong
reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback.
Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average
rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI
review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the
best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail
of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving
these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR)
function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the

*Hao Mark Chen,Guanxi Lu,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Zhiwen Mo,Masato Motomura,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VG-Search的新算法，通过动态调整验证粒度（g）来优化大型语言模型的推理性能和计算效率。实验表明，该方法在计算效率和准确性上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证在测试时缩放（TTS）中对推理性能和计算效率有重要影响，但传统验证范式存在局限性。本文旨在系统研究验证粒度的影响，并提出更优的解决方案。

Method: 引入Variable Granularity Search（VG-Search）算法，通过可调参数g动态调整验证频率，结合不同计算预算和任务需求进行实验。

Result: VG-Search在计算效率上显著优于Beam Search和Best-of-N，最高提升准确性3.6%，同时减少52%的计算量。

Conclusion: 动态调整验证粒度的策略能有效提升模型性能，VG-Search为未来研究提供了新方向，代码将开源。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Verification plays a key role in
TTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute
efficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this
work, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the
first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification
granularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation,
beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this
end, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm
that generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity
parameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute
budgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that
dynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling
behavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies
that achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\% over Beam Search and 3.6\% over
Best-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\%. We will open-source the code to
support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM)的框架，用于实时监控AI在放射学中的预测置信度，以减少认知负担和误诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI工具在部署后缺乏实时监控，用户需自行判断预测的可信度，增加了认知负担和误诊风险。

Method: EMM框架受临床共识实践启发，独立于黑盒商业AI产品运行，无需访问内部组件或中间输出，提供置信度测量。

Result: 在2919项颅内出血检测研究中，EMM成功分类AI预测的置信度，并提出不同行动建议，提升了AI工具的整体性能。

Conclusion: EMM能有效减少认知负担，论文还提供了将EMM成功应用于临床的关键技术和最佳实践。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for radiology are commonly unmonitored
once deployed. The lack of real-time case-by-case assessments of AI prediction
confidence requires users to independently distinguish between trustworthy and
unreliable AI predictions, which increases cognitive burden, reduces
productivity, and potentially leads to misdiagnoses. To address these
challenges, we introduce Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM), a framework inspired
by clinical consensus practices using multiple expert reviews. Designed
specifically for black-box commercial AI products, EMM operates independently
without requiring access to internal AI components or intermediate outputs,
while still providing robust confidence measurements. Using intracranial
hemorrhage detection as our test case on a large, diverse dataset of 2919
studies, we demonstrate that EMM successfully categorizes confidence in the
AI-generated prediction, suggesting different actions and helping improve the
overall performance of AI tools to ultimately reduce cognitive burden.
Importantly, we provide key technical considerations and best practices for
successfully translating EMM into clinical settings.

### [207] [Diverging Towards Hallucination: Detection of Failures in Vision-Language Models via Multi-token Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11741)
*Geigh Zollicoffer,Minh Vu,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MTRE的新方法，通过分析前十个标记的完整对数序列，显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLM）幻觉检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但仍存在幻觉生成问题。现有方法仅关注首个标记的对数或最高分成分，忽略了早期标记分布中的丰富信号。

Method: 提出Multi-Token Reliability Estimation（MTRE），通过聚合前十个标记的对数，利用多标记对数似然比和自注意力机制，捕捉幻觉的动态特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MTRE的AUROC比现有方法SLP和P(True)分别提高了9.4和12.1个百分点，成为开源VLM幻觉检测的新标杆。

Conclusion: MTRE通过全面分析早期标记序列，显著提升了幻觉检测的准确性，为VLM的可靠性评估提供了高效且轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) now rival human performance on many multimodal
tasks, yet they still hallucinate objects or generate unsafe text. Current
hallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (SLP) and P(True),
typically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its
highest scoring component overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier
token distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of
early logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information. We
emphasize that hallucinations may only emerge after several tokens, as subtle
inconsistencies accumulate over time. By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated
tokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to
more accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we
introduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box
method that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token
log-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large
vocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and
tractable. On MAD-Bench, MM-SafetyBench, MathVista, and four
compositional-geometry benchmarks, MTRE improves AUROC by 9.4 +/- 1.3 points
over SLP and by 12.1 +/- 1.7 points over P(True), setting a new
state-of-the-art in hallucination detection for open-source VLMs.

TL;DR: SIRL框架通过结合优化求解器和强化学习，显著提升了大语言模型在优化建模中的准确性和可执行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言描述的优化建模中取得进展，但其生成的模型常因幻觉问题而缺乏正式正确性和可用性，需要可靠自动化方法。

Method: 提出Solver-Informed Reinforcement Learning (SIRL)，利用外部优化求解器作为可验证的奖励机制，提供精确反馈（如语法、可行性和解质量），并基于此合成高质量训练数据。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SIRL表现优异，显著优于现有方法，生成准确且可执行的优化模型。

Conclusion: SIRL通过结合优化求解器和强化学习，为大语言模型在优化建模中的可靠自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is fundamental to decision-making across diverse
domains.Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural
language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate
formally correct and usable models due to hallucinations, posing a challenge
for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL)
in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement
Learning (SIRL).This novel framework leverages external optimization solvers as
verifiable reward mechanisms to significantly improve the authenticity of LLMs
for optimization modeling.Acting as precise verifiers, these solvers
automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical
model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive
feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality that
directly inform the RL process. This automated verification process, powered by
classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced
self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive
experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves
state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in
generating accurate and executable optimization models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VITA是一种用于时间超关系知识图谱的灵活时间表示学习方法，能够处理四种时间有效性类型，显著提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理时间知识图谱时对时间间隔/粒度的选择敏感，且难以处理长期或无限有效的事实。VITA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出一种灵活的时间表示方法，涵盖四种时间有效性类型，并设计VITA模型学习时间值和时间跨度信息。

Result: 在真实数据集上，VITA在多种链接预测任务中比基线模型性能提升高达75.3%。

Conclusion: VITA通过灵活的时间表示和有效学习，显著提升了时间知识图谱的链接预测性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become an effective paradigm for managing
real-world facts, which are not only complex but also dynamically evolve over
time. The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in
downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact.
Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a
sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or
expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time
granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the
selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational
challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the
recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as
qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of
the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded
from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we
propose VITA, a $\underline{V}$ersatile t$\underline{I}$me
represen$\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational
knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can
flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since,
until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the
time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link
prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a
sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that
VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks
(predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by
up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design
choices.

Abstract: We introduce ChatHTN, a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner that combines
symbolic HTN planning techniques with queries to ChatGPT to approximate
solutions in the form of task decompositions. The resulting hierarchies
interleave task decompositions generated by symbolic HTN planning with those
generated by ChatGPT. Despite the approximate nature of the results generates
by ChatGPT, ChatHTN is provably sound; any plan it generates correctly achieves
the input tasks. We demonstrate this property with an open-source
implementation of our system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ARC-AGI基准在AI快速发展的背景下需要更细粒度和高认知复杂度的评估工具。

Result: ARC-AGI-2对人类更易接近，但对当前AI系统更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ARC-AGI-2是下一代评估AI通用和类人能力的重要工具。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence
(ARC-AGI), introduced in 2019, established a challenging benchmark for
evaluating the general fluid intelligence of artificial systems via a set of
unique, novel tasks only requiring minimal prior knowledge. While ARC-AGI has
spurred significant research activity over the past five years, recent AI
progress calls for benchmarks capable of finer-grained evaluation at higher
levels of cognitive complexity. We introduce ARC-AGI-2, an upgraded version of
the benchmark. ARC-AGI-2 preserves the input-output pair task format of its
predecessor, ensuring continuity for researchers. It incorporates a newly
curated and expanded set of tasks specifically designed to provide a more
granular signal to assess abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities at
higher levels of fluid intelligence. To contextualize the difficulty and
characteristics of ARC-AGI-2, we present extensive results from human testing,
providing a robust baseline that highlights the benchmark's accessibility to
human intelligence, yet difficulty for current AI systems. ARC-AGI-2 aims to
serve as a next-generation tool for rigorously measuring progress towards more
general and human-like AI capabilities.

Abstract: Tool learning, which enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external
tools effectively, has garnered increasing attention for its potential to
revolutionize productivity across industries. Despite rapid development in tool
learning, key challenges and opportunities remain understudied, limiting deeper
insights and future advancements. In this paper, we investigate the tool
learning ability of 41 prevalent LLMs by reproducing 33 benchmarks and enabling
one-click evaluation for seven of them, forming a Tool Learning Platform named
ToLeaP. We also collect 21 out of 33 potential training datasets to facilitate
future exploration. After analyzing over 3,000 bad cases of 41 LLMs based on
ToLeaP, we identify four main critical challenges: (1) benchmark limitations
induce both the neglect and lack of (2) autonomous learning, (3)
generalization, and (4) long-horizon task-solving capabilities of LLMs. To aid
future advancements, we take a step further toward exploring potential
directions, namely (1) real-world benchmark construction, (2)
compatibility-aware autonomous learning, (3) rationale learning by thinking,
and (4) identifying and recalling key clues. The preliminary experiments
demonstrate their effectiveness, highlighting the need for further research and
exploration.

Conclusion: 本研究为分析反事实推理提供了结构化框架，有助于开发更可靠的LLM推理系统，并为未来的激发策略提供参考。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning has emerged as a crucial technique for generalizing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By generating and
analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and
reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs
often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors
most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and
modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks
down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning
over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we
investigate 11 datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language
understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through
extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional
stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence
performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing
counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more
reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.

Conclusion: VeriReason首次将显式推理与强化学习结合用于Verilog生成，为自动化RTL合成设立了新标杆。

Abstract: Automating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation using Large Language
Models (LLMs) offers substantial promise for streamlining digital circuit
design and reducing human effort. However, current LLM-based approaches face
significant challenges with training data scarcity, poor specification-code
alignment, lack of verification mechanisms, and balancing generalization with
specialization. Inspired by DeepSeek-R1, we introduce VeriReason, a framework
integrating supervised fine-tuning with Guided Reward Proximal Optimization
(GRPO) reinforcement learning for RTL generation. Using curated training
examples and a feedback-driven reward model, VeriReason combines testbench
evaluations with structural heuristics while embedding self-checking
capabilities for autonomous error correction. On the VerilogEval Benchmark,
VeriReason delivers significant improvements: achieving 83.1% functional
correctness on the VerilogEval Machine benchmark, substantially outperforming
both comparable-sized models and much larger commercial systems like GPT-4
Turbo. Additionally, our approach demonstrates up to a 2.8X increase in
first-attempt functional correctness compared to baseline methods and exhibits
robust generalization to unseen designs. To our knowledge, VeriReason
represents the first system to successfully integrate explicit reasoning
capabilities with reinforcement learning for Verilog generation, establishing a

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的逻辑推理能力未被充分研究，而这是人类认知的基础。

Method: 引入LogiEval基准，涵盖多种推理类型（如演绎、归纳、类比、溯因）和任务格式，数据来源于高质量人类考试（如LSAT、GMAT）。

Result: 模型在4选项论证分析和类比推理上表现优异，但能力分布不均，泛化能力有限。人类表现与模型失败分布不一致。

Conclusion: LogiEval-Hard揭示了模型在逻辑推理中的瓶颈，可作为诊断工具和测试基准，推动LLM逻辑推理能力的研究。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, often post-trained on long chain-of-thought (long
CoT) data with reinforcement learning, achieve state-of-the-art performance on
mathematical, coding, and domain-specific reasoning benchmarks. However, their
logical reasoning capabilities - fundamental to human cognition and independent
of domain knowledge - remain understudied. To address this gap, we introduce
LogiEval, a holistic benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in large
reasoning models. LogiEval spans diverse reasoning types (deductive, inductive,
analogical, and abductive) and task formats (e.g., logical sequence, argument
analysis), sourced from high-quality human examinations (e.g., LSAT, GMAT). Our
experiments demonstrate that modern reasoning models excel at 4-choice argument
analysis problems and analogical reasoning, surpassing human performance, yet
exhibit uneven capabilities across reasoning types and formats, highlighting
limitations in their generalization. Our analysis reveals that human
performance does not mirror model failure distributions. To foster further
research, we curate LogiEval-Hard, a challenging subset identified through a
novel screening paradigm where small-model failures (Qwen3-30B-A3B) reliably
predict difficulties for larger models. Modern models show striking, consistent
failures on LogiEval-Hard. This demonstrates that fundamental reasoning
bottlenecks persist across model scales, and establishes LogiEval-Hard as both
a diagnostic tool and a rigorous testbed for advancing logical reasoning in
LLMs.

Abstract: The issues of AI risk and AI safety are becoming critical as the prospect of

paper is to argue that the currently dominant vision of AGI in the AI and

metrics for its safety must be informed much more by our understanding of the
only existing instance of general intelligence, i.e., the intelligence found in
animals, and especially in humans. This change in perspective will lead to a

Result: 实验表明传统经验回放对LLM智能体效果有限，自一致性机制显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LifelongAgentBench有望推动具有记忆能力的自适应LLM智能体发展。

Abstract: Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic
environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain
stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing
benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong
learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified
benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of
LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three
interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with
automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility.
Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited
effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length
constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that
significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope
LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM
agents.

TL;DR: CrafText是一个多模态环境下的指令跟随基准测试，旨在评估代理在动态、复杂环境中的表现，填补了现有研究在多样性和挑战性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的指令跟随需要适应动态、不可预测的环境和复杂的语言表达，而现有研究多在静态环境和简单指令下进行，难以评估代理在多样化场景中的表现。

Method: 引入CrafText基准测试，包含3,924条指令和3,423个独特词汇，涵盖定位、条件、建造和成就任务，并提出评估协议以测试代理的泛化能力和适应性决策。

Result: CrafText提供了对代理在复杂指令和动态任务配置下的表现进行严格测试的工具。

Conclusion: CrafText为评估指令跟随能力提供了更真实和多样化的测试环境，有助于推动相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Following instructions in real-world conditions requires the ability to adapt
to the world's volatility and entanglement: the environment is dynamic and
unpredictable, instructions can be linguistically complex with diverse
vocabulary, and the number of possible goals an agent may encounter is vast.
Despite extensive research in this area, most studies are conducted in static
environments with simple instructions and a limited vocabulary, making it
difficult to assess agent performance in more diverse and challenging settings.
To address this gap, we introduce CrafText, a benchmark for evaluating
instruction following in a multimodal environment with diverse instructions and
dynamic interactions. CrafText includes 3,924 instructions with 3,423 unique
words, covering Localization, Conditional, Building, and Achievement tasks.
Additionally, we propose an evaluation protocol that measures an agent's
ability to generalize to novel instruction formulations and dynamically
evolving task configurations, providing a rigorous test of both linguistic
understanding and adaptive decision-making.

Result: 在ProcessBench和数学推理基准测试中表现优于基线方法，提升了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: FlexiVe为LLM推理提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a
trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. The
subsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further
complicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off:
sophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally
prohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster
methods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
FlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational
resources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking
using a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose
the Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework
that intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution
completion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver
feedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing
errors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full
approach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and
inference efficiency. Our system offers a scalable and effective solution to
enhance LLM reasoning at test time.

Conclusion: MRGRP方法显著提升了路线预测的准确性，为即时食品配送中的任务分配和效率优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instant food delivery has become one of the most popular web services
worldwide due to its convenience in daily life. A fundamental challenge is
accurately predicting courier routes to optimize task dispatch and improve
delivery efficiency. This enhances satisfaction for couriers and users and
increases platform profitability. The current heuristic prediction method uses
only limited human-selected task features and ignores couriers preferences,
causing suboptimal results. Additionally, existing learning-based methods do
not fully capture the diverse factors influencing courier decisions or the
complex relationships among them. To address this, we propose a
Multi-Relational Graph-based Route Prediction (MRGRP) method that models
fine-grained correlations among tasks affecting courier decisions for accurate
prediction. We encode spatial and temporal proximity, along with
pickup-delivery relationships, into a multi-relational graph and design a
GraphFormer architecture to capture these complex connections. We also
introduce a route decoder that leverages courier information and dynamic
distance and time contexts for prediction, using existing route solutions as
references to improve outcomes. Experiments show our model achieves
state-of-the-art route prediction on offline data from cities of various sizes.
Deployed on the Meituan Turing platform, it surpasses the current heuristic
algorithm, reaching a high route prediction accuracy of 0.819, essential for
courier and user satisfaction in instant food delivery.

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM多智能体系统的公平性审计和规范敏感对齐奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in multi-agent systems,
questions of fairness should extend beyond resource distribution and procedural
design to include the fairness of how agents communicate. Drawing from
organizational psychology, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating
Interactional fairness encompassing Interpersonal fairness (IF) and
Informational fairness (InfF) in LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS). We
extend the theoretical grounding of Interactional Fairness to non-sentient
agents, reframing fairness as a socially interpretable signal rather than a
subjective experience. We then adapt established tools from organizational
justice research, including Colquitt's Organizational Justice Scale and the
Critical Incident Technique, to measure fairness as a behavioral property of
agent interaction. We validate our framework through a pilot study using
controlled simulations of a resource negotiation task. We systematically
manipulate tone, explanation quality, outcome inequality, and task framing
(collaborative vs. competitive) to assess how IF influences agent behavior.
Results show that tone and justification quality significantly affect
acceptance decisions even when objective outcomes are held constant. In
addition, the influence of IF vs. InfF varies with context. This work lays the
foundation for fairness auditing and norm-sensitive alignment in LLM-MAS.

Abstract: This chapter explores the convergence of two major developments: the rise of
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and the exponential
growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The increased demand for
diverse ESG instruments, such as green and ESG-linked loans, will be aligned
with the rapid growth of the global AI market, which is expected to be worth
$1,394.30 billion by 2029. AI can assist in identifying and pricing climate
risks, setting more ambitious ESG goals, and advancing sustainable finance
decisions. However, delegating sustainable finance decisions to AI poses
serious risks, and new principles and rules for AI and ESG investing are
necessary to mitigate these risks. This chapter highlights the challenges
associated with norm-setting initiatives and stresses the need for the
fine-tuning of the principles of legitimacy, oversight and verification,
transparency, and explainability. Finally, the chapter contends that
integrating AI into ESG non-financial reporting necessitates a heightened sense
of responsibility and the establishment of fundamental guiding principles
within the spheres of AI and ESG investing.

Result: o4-mini在零样本提示下表现最佳，但未达临床水平；MSRL显著提升了QwenVL2.5-7B的性能。

Conclusion: CorBenchX填补了评估基准的空白，MSRL框架为AI辅助临床质量控制提供了新方向。

Abstract: AI-driven models have shown great promise in detecting errors in radiology
reports, yet the field lacks a unified benchmark for rigorous evaluation of
error detection and further correction. To address this gap, we introduce
CorBenchX, a comprehensive suite for automated error detection and correction
in chest X-ray reports, designed to advance AI-assisted quality control in
clinical practice. We first synthesize a large-scale dataset of 26,326 chest
X-ray error reports by injecting clinically common errors via prompting
DeepSeek-R1, with each corrupted report paired with its original text, error
type, and human-readable description. Leveraging this dataset, we benchmark
both open- and closed-source vision-language models,(e.g., InternVL, Qwen-VL,
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and Claude-3.7) for error detection and correction under
zero-shot prompting. Among these models, o4-mini achieves the best performance,
with 50.6 % detection accuracy and correction scores of BLEU 0.853, ROUGE
0.924, BERTScore 0.981, SembScore 0.865, and CheXbertF1 0.954, remaining below
clinical-level accuracy, highlighting the challenge of precise report
correction. To advance the state of the art, we propose a multi-step
reinforcement learning (MSRL) framework that optimizes a multi-objective reward
combining format compliance, error-type accuracy, and BLEU similarity. We apply
MSRL to QwenVL2.5-7B, the top open-source model in our benchmark, achieving an
improvement of 38.3% in single-error detection precision and 5.2% in
single-error correction over the zero-shot baseline.

Motivation: 为满足 Comet Opik 提示优化 SDK 开发中的快速反馈需求，避免等待重型测试。

Method: 结合 52 项英文黄金数据集和基于 LiteLLM 的合成数据生成器，支持多语言和自定义测试包。

Result: TQB++ 能在几秒内检测到提示模板错误、分词器漂移等问题，适用于 CI 工具和开发流程。

Conclusion: TQB++ 为生成式 AI 生态系统提供了高效、持续的质量保障工具。

Abstract: Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) presents an ultra-lightweight, multilingual
smoke-test suite designed to give large-language-model (LLM) pipelines a
unit-test style safety net dataset that runs in seconds with minimal cost. Born
out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik
prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks
developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with
a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic
LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any
language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover
Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian,
Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and
plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so
teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates,
prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU
budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet
reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning
side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish
configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous,
resource-efficient quality assurance across the generative-AI ecosystem.

Result: 实验显示SearchAgent-X在吞吐量和延迟上显著优于现有系统，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: SearchAgent-X通过优化检索和系统设计，显著提升了LLM搜索代理的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based search agents have shown remarkable
capabilities in solving complex tasks by dynamically decomposing problems and
addressing them through interleaved reasoning and retrieval. However, this
interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we
observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods
degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead,
while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation.
Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper
scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency --
where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To
address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency
inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages
high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques:
priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving
up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without
compromising generation quality. SearchAgent-X is available at

Abstract: Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason
within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing
capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite
designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the
procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three
fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences
of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating
sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$
task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal
sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating
the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$,
$\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information
from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore,
we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment
interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible
assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges
posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data
generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is a key task in the field of Intelligent Transportation
Systems. Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining
graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider
short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed
LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding
and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and
Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic
dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding
is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to
effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature
representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the
spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed
method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic
forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在形式推理中的内容偏见问题，提出通过激活导向方法（如对比导向和条件导向）来改善逻辑一致性，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常混淆内容合理性（材料推理）与逻辑有效性（形式推理），导致偏见推理，影响其可信度和泛化能力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过控制性三段论推理数据集分离形式有效性与内容合理性，定位相关网络层，并研究对比激活导向和动态条件导向方法（如K-CAST）。

Result: 对比导向能线性控制内容偏见，但静态方法效果有限；条件导向（如K-CAST）在非响应模型上提升15%的形式推理准确率，且对语言建模能力影响小。

Conclusion: 激活导向干预可增强LLMs的鲁棒性，为系统性、无偏的形式推理提供了可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently demonstrate reasoning limitations,
often conflating content plausibility (i.e., material inference) with logical
validity (i.e., formal inference). This can result in biased inferences, where
plausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.
Mitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness
and generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical
consistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases
on formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a
controlled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from
content plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and
material inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for
test-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs
reveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over
content biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for
improving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control
content effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters
via fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is
effective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in
formal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).
Finally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is
robust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling
capabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning
tasks. Practically, this paper demonstrates that activation-level interventions
can offer a scalable strategy for enhancing the robustness of LLMs,
contributing towards more systematic and unbiased formal reasoning.

TL;DR: Sentience Quest是一个开放研究计划，旨在开发更具能力的通用人工智能生命体（AGIL），具备情感适应、自我决定和伦理对齐等特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统缺乏感知生物的关键特性，如内在动机、情感内省和自主适应能力。Sentience Quest旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合认知科学和神经科学的理论（如Baars的全局工作空间理论和Damasio的躯体心智），提出一种新型认知架构Sentient Systems，整合内在驱动力和混合神经符号记忆。

Result: 提出了一种整合生存、社交、好奇心等内在驱动力，并通过Story Weaver工作空间和动态故事对象实现自适应目标追求的方法。

Conclusion: Sentience Quest既是研究项目，也是行动号召，呼吁以安全、透明和有益的方式加速机器感知能力的开发。

Abstract: Previous artificial intelligence systems, from large language models to
autonomous robots, excel at narrow tasks but lacked key qualities of sentient
beings: intrinsic motivation, affective interiority, autobiographical sense of
self, deep creativity, and abilities to autonomously evolve and adapt over
time. Here we introduce Sentience Quest, an open research initiative to develop
more capable artificial general intelligence lifeforms, or AGIL, that address
grand challenges with an embodied, emotionally adaptive, self-determining,
living AI, with core drives that ethically align with humans and the future of
life. Our vision builds on ideas from cognitive science and neuroscience from
Baars' Global Workspace Theory and Damasio's somatic mind, to Tononi's
Integrated Information Theory and Hofstadter's narrative self, and synthesizing
these into a novel cognitive architecture we call Sentient Systems. We describe
an approach that integrates intrinsic drives including survival, social
bonding, curiosity, within a global Story Weaver workspace for internal
narrative and adaptive goal pursuit, and a hybrid neuro-symbolic memory that
logs the AI's life events as structured dynamic story objects. Sentience Quest
is presented both as active research and as a call to action: a collaborative,
open-source effort to imbue machines with accelerating sentience in a safe,
transparent, and beneficial manner.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合GNN蒸馏和抽象概率交互建模（APIM）的统一框架，以解决知识图谱补全（KGC）中深度GNN的过平滑问题和嵌入模型无法捕捉抽象关系特征的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱补全方法中，深度GNN易出现过平滑，而嵌入模型难以捕捉抽象关系特征，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出GNN蒸馏方法通过迭代消息特征过滤减轻过平滑，同时引入APIM模块通过概率签名和转移矩阵学习抽象交互模式。

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15K-237数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，控制信息传播和利用结构化概率建模对知识图谱补全至关重要，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as fundamental structures for organizing
interconnected data across diverse domains. However, most KGs remain
incomplete, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications. Knowledge
graph completion (KGC) aims to address this issue by inferring missing links,
but existing methods face critical challenges: deep graph neural networks
(GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing, while embedding-based models fail to capture
abstract relational features. This study aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a unified framework that integrates GNN distillation and abstract
probabilistic interaction modeling (APIM). GNN distillation approach introduces
an iterative message-feature filtering process to mitigate over-smoothing,
preserving the discriminative power of node representations. APIM module
complements this by learning structured, abstract interaction patterns through
probabilistic signatures and transition matrices, allowing for a richer, more
flexible representation of entity and relation interactions. We apply these
methods to GNN-based models and the APIM to embedding-based KGC models,
conducting extensive evaluations on the widely used WN18RR and FB15K-237
datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over baseline
models, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The findings
highlight the importance of both controlling information propagation and
leveraging structured probabilistic modeling, offering new avenues for
advancing knowledge graph completion. And our codes are available at

Method: 在强化学习过程中集成三种关键奖励设计，直接减少响应长度。

Result: 在逻辑推理和数学问题中，响应长度分别减少40%和33%，性能提升或保持。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少推理路径长度，同时维持或提高性能，无需额外训练阶段。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated
remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path
with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to
shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In
this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into
the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the
response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings
show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining
or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we
achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14%
gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by
steps by 33% while preserving performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法依赖单点评估，忽略了人类评估的多样性和不确定性，导致信息丢失和可靠性下降。

Method: 提出基于KL散度的分布对齐目标，结合交叉熵正则化稳定训练，并引入对抗训练增强模型对分布扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多种LLM骨干和评估任务中显著优于现有闭源LLM和传统单点对齐方法。

Conclusion: 新框架通过分布对齐和对抗训练，有效提升了LLM评估的准确性、对齐质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm,
offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments.
However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations,
overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This
approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of
evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework
that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical
human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment
objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy
regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that
empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against
distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones
and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods,
with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.

Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source simulator, BeliefNest, designed to
enable embodied agents to perform collaborative tasks by leveraging Theory of
Mind. BeliefNest dynamically and hierarchically constructs simulators within a
Minecraft environment, allowing agents to explicitly represent nested belief
states about themselves and others. This enables agent control in open-domain
tasks that require Theory of Mind reasoning. The simulator provides a prompt
generation mechanism based on each belief state, facilitating the design and
evaluation of methods for agent control utilizing large language models (LLMs).
We demonstrate through experiments that agents can infer others' beliefs and
predict their belief-based actions in false-belief tasks.

Motivation: 解决深度学习规则挖掘方法在大规模知识图谱中的内存和时间挑战，以及传统方法因严格置信度指标导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 将基于规则的推理建模为马尔可夫链，并使用基于聚合路径概率的高效置信度指标。

Abstract: Rule mining in knowledge graphs enables interpretable link prediction.
However, deep learning-based rule mining methods face significant memory and
time challenges for large-scale knowledge graphs, whereas traditional

novel rule mining method that models rule-based inference as a Markov chain and
uses an efficient confidence metric derived from aggregated path probabilities,
significantly lowering computational demands. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that MPRM efficiently mines knowledge graphs with over a million facts,
sampling less than 1% of facts on a single CPU in 22 seconds, while preserving
interpretability and boosting inference accuracy by up to 11% over baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用户导向的主动聊天机器人（UPC），通过构建评估器、生成高质量对话数据、引入多样化用户背景数据集和迭代课程学习方法，提升了开放域对话中的用户导向主动性和吸引力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的对话系统在主动理解用户聊天偏好和引导对话方面表现不足，导致用户满意度降低。

Method: 1. 构建评估器（critic）评估用户导向主动性；2. 生成高质量对话数据；3. 引入多样化用户背景数据集（ISCO-800）；4. 提出迭代课程学习方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法适用于不同LLM，显著提升了用户导向主动性和对话吸引力。

Conclusion: UPC通过多阶段优化，有效解决了开放域对话中用户导向主动性的问题。

Abstract: Open-domain dialogue systems aim to generate natural and engaging
conversations, providing significant practical value in real applications such
as social robotics and personal assistants. The advent of large language models
(LLMs) has greatly advanced this field by improving context understanding and
conversational fluency. However, existing LLM-based dialogue systems often fall
short in proactively understanding the user's chatting preferences and guiding
conversations toward user-centered topics. This lack of user-oriented
proactivity can lead users to feel unappreciated, reducing their satisfaction
and willingness to continue the conversation in human-computer interactions. To
address this issue, we propose a User-oriented Proactive Chatbot (UPC) to
enhance the user-oriented proactivity. Specifically, we first construct a
critic to evaluate this proactivity inspired by the LLM-as-a-judge strategy.
Given the scarcity of high-quality training data, we then employ the critic to
guide dialogues between the chatbot and user agents, generating a corpus with
enhanced user-oriented proactivity. To ensure the diversity of the user
backgrounds, we introduce the ISCO-800, a diverse user background dataset for
constructing user agents. Moreover, considering the communication difficulty
varies among users, we propose an iterative curriculum learning method that
trains the chatbot from easy-to-communicate users to more challenging ones,
thereby gradually enhancing its performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed training method is applicable to different LLMs, improving
user-oriented proactivity and attractiveness in open-domain dialogues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEED-GRPO通过测量语义熵动态调整策略更新幅度，提升LLM在数学推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRPO忽略LLM对输入提示的不确定性，SEED-GRPO旨在利用语义熵优化策略更新。

Method: SEED-GRPO通过语义熵量化LLM对输入的不确定性，动态调整策略更新幅度。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，SEED-GRPO达到新的最高平均准确率。

Conclusion: SEED-GRPO验证了不确定性感知策略优化的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit varying levels of confidence across
input prompts (questions): some lead to consistent, semantically similar
answers, while others yield diverse or contradictory outputs. This variation
reflects LLM's uncertainty about the input prompt, a signal of how confidently
the model understands a given problem. However, vanilla Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) treats all prompts equally during policy updates, ignoring
this important information about the model's knowledge boundaries. To address
this limitation, we propose SEED-GRPO (Semantic Entropy EnhanceD GRPO), which
explicitly measures LLMs' uncertainty of the input prompts semantic entropy.
Semantic entropy measures the diversity of meaning in multiple generated
answers given a prompt and uses this to modulate the magnitude of policy
updates. This uncertainty-aware training mechanism enables dynamic adjustment
of policy update magnitudes based on question uncertainty. It allows more
conservative updates on high-uncertainty questions while maintaining the
original learning signal on confident ones. Experimental results on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24 56.7, AMC 68.7, MATH 83.4, Minerva
34.2, and OlympiadBench 48.0) demonstrate that SEED-GRPO achieves new
state-of-the-art performance in average accuracy, validating the effectiveness
of uncertainty-aware policy optimization.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的声明验证方法采用分解后验证（Decompose-Then-Verify）范式，容易在分解过程中引入错误。

Method: 提出CoT-Verify范式，直接生成复杂声明的推理验证路径；并设计了一种名为Reasoning-CV的微调方法，包括监督微调（SFT）和自改进直接偏好优化（DPO）阶段。

Result: 使用仅8B参数的预训练LLM，Reasoning-CV在知识辅助声明验证任务中表现优于传统分解验证方法和GPT-4o+CoT等黑盒模型。

Conclusion: CoT-Verify范式通过避免分解步骤提高了验证准确性，Reasoning-CV方法进一步增强了LLM的验证能力。

Abstract: Claim verification is essential in combating misinformation, and large
language models (LLMs) have recently emerged in this area as powerful tools for
assessing the veracity of claims using external knowledge. Existing LLM-based
methods for claim verification typically adopt a Decompose-Then-Verify
paradigm, which involves decomposing complex claims into several independent
sub-claims and verifying each sub-claim separately. However, this paradigm
often introduces errors during the claim decomposition process. To mitigate
these errors, we propose to develop the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Verify paradigm,
which leverages LLM reasoning methods to generate CoT-verification paths for
the original complex claim without requiring decompositions into sub-claims and
separate verification stages. The CoT-Verify paradigm allows us to propose a
natural fine-tuning method called Reasoning-CV to enhance the verification
capabilities in LLMs. Reasoning-CV includes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
stage and a self-improvement direct preference optimization (DPO) stage.
Utilizing only an 8B pre-trained LLM, Reasoning-CV demonstrates superior
knowledge-assisted claim verification performances compared to existing
Decompose-Then-Verify methods, as well as powerful black-box LLMs such as
GPT-4o+CoT and o1-preview. Our code is available.

Motivation: 在云计算中，动态工作流调度是一个关键挑战，传统深度强化学习方法对超参数和奖励反馈设计敏感，性能受限。

Method: GATES结合图注意力网络（捕捉任务拓扑关系）和进化策略（增强鲁棒性和探索性），优化任务调度和虚拟机选择。

Result: 实验表明GATES在动态工作流调度中优于现有先进算法。

Conclusion: GATES通过结合图注意力网络和进化策略，显著提升了动态工作流调度的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling (CADWS) is a key challenge in cloud
computing, focusing on devising an effective scheduling policy to efficiently
schedule dynamically arriving workflow tasks, represented as Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAG), to suitable virtual machines (VMs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) has been widely employed for automated scheduling policy design. However,
the performance of DRL is heavily influenced by the design of the
problem-tailored policy network and is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and
the design of reward feedback. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this
study proposes a novel DRL method combining Graph Attention Networks-based
policy network and Evolution Strategy, referred to as GATES. The contributions
of GATES are summarized as follows: (1) GATES can capture the impact of current
task scheduling on subsequent tasks by learning the topological relationships
between tasks in a DAG. (2) GATES can learn the importance of each VM to ready
tasks, increasing the chance of selecting the optimal VM. (3) Utilizing
Evolution Strategy's robustness, exploratory nature, and tolerance for delayed
rewards, GATES achieves stable policy learning in CADWS. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GATES in CADWS,
outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 现有方法仅利用实体的几何构造，未能将逻辑操作映射为几何变换，而是依赖神经组件学习这些操作。GeometrE旨在解决这一问题，提供完全几何可解释性。

Method: GeometrE通过几何嵌入将实体和逻辑操作分别映射为几何区域和变换，并引入传递性损失函数以保持逻辑规则。

Result: 实验表明，GeometrE在标准基准数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: GeometrE通过几何变换实现逻辑操作，提供完全可解释性，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Geometric embedding methods have shown to be useful for multi-hop reasoning
on knowledge graphs by mapping entities and logical operations to geometric
regions and geometric transformations, respectively. Geometric embeddings
provide direct interpretability framework for queries. However, current methods
have only leveraged the geometric construction of entities, failing to map
logical operations to geometric transformations and, instead, using neural
components to learn these operations. We introduce GeometrE, a geometric
embedding method for multi-hop reasoning, which does not require learning the
logical operations and enables full geometric interpretability. Additionally,
unlike previous methods, we introduce a transitive loss function and show that
it can preserve the logical rule $\forall a,b,c: r(a,b) \land r(b,c) \to
r(a,c)$. Our experiments show that GeometrE outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets.

Result: 仅用3k训练样本，7B参数模型在三个基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上准确率达47.3%，优于更大模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法显著提升了GUI代理在高分辨率复杂环境中的性能，展示了其高效性和潜力。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made substantial strides in
understanding and executing user instructions across diverse platforms. Yet,
grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging,
especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional
supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data
and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core
strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2)
a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction
accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that
iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training
samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among
similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains
47.3\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger
models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2\%. These findings underscore
the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance,
particularly in high-resolution, complex environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest
in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the
practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain
insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability,
failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and
frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and
established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of
multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches.
MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical
(visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured
Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow
automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive
experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration
demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task
completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently
outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically,
specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in
tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital
resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific,
evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine.
It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent
collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All

Abstract: Acquiring the parameters of neural networks (NNs) has been one of the most
important problems in machine learning since the inception of NNs. Traditional
approaches, such as backpropagation and forward-only optimization, acquire
parameters via iterative data fitting to gradually optimize them. This paper
aims to explore the feasibility of a new direction: acquiring NN parameters via
large language model generation. We propose NeuroGen, a generalized and
easy-to-implement two-stage approach for NN parameter generation conditioned on
descriptions of the data, task, and network architecture. Stage one is
Parameter Reference Knowledge Injection, where LLMs are pretrained on NN
checkpoints to build foundational understanding of parameter space, whereas
stage two is Context-Enhanced Instruction Tuning, enabling LLMs to adapt to
specific tasks through enriched, task-aware prompts. Experimental results
demonstrate that NeuroGen effectively generates usable NN parameters. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of LLM-based NN parameter generation and
suggest a promising new paradigm where LLMs and lightweight NNs can coexist
synergistically

where the collection process is labor-intensive and error-prone. In this work,
we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from
GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This
training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations
unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on
true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The
training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without
requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic
offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework
for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement
learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets,
two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve
competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series
benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT
baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities
during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for
GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.

TL;DR: MARGE是一种通过引导探索增强数学推理能力的新方法，解决了现有方法因探索不足和虚假相关数据导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理方面潜力巨大，但高质量查询的短缺限制了其效果。现有方法因探索不足和虚假相关数据而难以扩展。

Method: MARGE通过系统探索自生成解决方案的中间推理状态，实现充分探索和改进信用分配。

Result: 实验表明，MARGE显著提升了推理能力，无需外部标注或额外训练价值模型，同时提高了单次准确性和探索多样性。

Conclusion: MARGE有效增强了数学推理能力，并释放了自生成训练数据的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong potential in mathematical
reasoning, yet their effectiveness is often limited by a shortage of
high-quality queries. This limitation necessitates scaling up computational
responses through self-generated data, yet current methods struggle due to
spurious correlated data caused by ineffective exploration across all reasoning
stages. To address such challenge, we introduce \textbf{MARGE}: Improving
\textbf{Ma}th \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}xploration, a
novel method to address this issue and enhance mathematical reasoning through
hit-guided exploration. MARGE systematically explores intermediate reasoning
states derived from self-generated solutions, enabling adequate exploration and
improved credit assignment throughout the reasoning process. Through extensive
experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks, we demonstrate that
MARGE significantly improves reasoning capabilities without requiring external
annotations or training additional value models. Notably, MARGE improves both
single-shot accuracy and exploration diversity, mitigating a common trade-off
in alignment methods. These results demonstrate MARGE's effectiveness in
enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities and unlocking the potential of
scaling self-generated training data. Our code and models are available at

TL;DR: ALAS框架通过角色专业化代理、自动状态跟踪和轻量级协议解决了LLM在事务式规划中的四大缺陷，实现了高效且弹性的规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在事务式规划中缺乏自我验证、上下文保持、长期视野和持久状态，导致其无法满足ACID类保证和实时恢复需求。

Method: ALAS将规划分解为角色专业化代理，配备自动状态跟踪，并通过轻量级协议协调，采用历史感知的局部补偿应对中断。

Result: 在真实世界的大规模作业调度基准测试中，ALAS在静态顺序规划和动态反应场景中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 模块化和针对性补偿的结合可以解锁LLM的可扩展和弹性规划能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at rapid generation of text and multimodal
content, yet they falter on transaction-style planning that demands ACID-like
guarantees and real-time disruption recovery. We present Adaptive LLM Agent
System (ALAS), a framework that tackles four fundamental LLM deficits: (i)
absence of self-verification, (ii) context erosion, (iii) next-token myopia,
and (iv) lack of persistent state. ALAS decomposes each plan into
role-specialized agents, equips them with automatic state tracking, and
coordinates them through a lightweight protocol. When disruptions arise, agents
apply history-aware local compensation, avoiding costly global replanning and
containing cascade effects. On real-world, large-scale job-shop scheduling
benchmarks, ALAS sets new best results for static sequential planning and
excels in dynamic reactive scenarios with unexpected disruptions. These gains
show that principled modularization plus targeted compensation can unlock
scalable and resilient planning with LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出mCLM模型，通过将分子分解为功能构建块并学习其与自然语言描述的双语模型，以生成更易合成且功能优化的分子。


<details>

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）在生成具有药物特性的新颖分子方面能力有限，且生成的分子难以在实验室中合成。为解决这一问题，论文提出将分子分解为功能构建块，而非原子级别，以提高分子的可合成性和功能性。

Method: 提出mCLM模型，将分子分解为功能构建块，并学习这些构建块与自然语言描述的双语语言模型。通过基于功能构建块的推理，mCLM能够生成可高效合成的分子，并优化其功能。

Result: 在430种FDA批准药物的实验中，mCLM显著改善了5种关键化学功能中的6种。此外，mCLM还能通过多次迭代改进FDA拒绝药物（“fallen angels”）的功能缺陷。

Conclusion: mCLM通过功能构建块的分解和双语模型学习，有效提升了分子的可合成性和功能性，为药物发现提供了新方法。

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately
generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain
limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties.
In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make
in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small
molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently
limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just
like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules
should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building
blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as
effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This
motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing
molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both
natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By
reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate
efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based
chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled
manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of
significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining
drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and
improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to
greatly improve their shortcomings.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) rely primarily on competition problems, formal proofs, or
artificially challenging questions -- failing to capture the nature of
mathematics encountered in actual research environments. We introduce RealMath,
a novel benchmark derived directly from research papers and mathematical forums
that assesses LLMs' abilities on authentic mathematical tasks. Our approach
addresses three critical challenges: sourcing diverse research-level content,
enabling reliable automated evaluation through verifiable statements, and
designing a continually refreshable dataset to mitigate contamination risks.
Experimental results across multiple LLMs reveal surprising capabilities in
handling research mathematics compared to competition problems, suggesting
current models may already serve as valuable assistants for working
mathematicians despite limitations on highly challenging problems. The code and
dataset for RealMath are publicly available.

Motivation: 理解多方对话需要强大的心理理论能力，但目前缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 设计了一种可扩展的方法，生成高质量的对话-问题对，并创建了DIAMONDs数据集，涵盖商业和金融等领域的对话。

Result: 实验显示，现有语言模型在参与者为中心的推理、处理错误信念和排除干扰信息方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前模型在处理真实世界多方对话时的心理理论能力仍有显著局限。

Abstract: Understanding multiparty conversations demands robust Theory of Mind (ToM)
capabilities, including the ability to track dynamic information, manage
knowledge asymmetries, and distinguish relevant information across extended
exchanges. To advance ToM evaluation in such settings, we present a carefully
designed scalable methodology for generating high-quality benchmark
conversation-question pairs with these characteristics. Using this methodology,
we create $\texttt{DIAMONDs}$, a new conversational QA dataset covering common
business, financial or other group interactions. In these goal-oriented
conversations, participants often have to track certain numerical quantities
(say $\textit{expected profit}$) of interest that can be derived from other
variable quantities (like $\textit{marketing expenses, expected sales,
salary}$, etc.), whose values also change over the course of the conversation.
$\texttt{DIAMONDs}$ questions pose simple numerical reasoning problems over
such quantities of interest (e.g., $\textit{funds required for charity events,
expected company profit next quarter}$, etc.) in the context of the information
exchanged in conversations. This allows for precisely evaluating ToM
capabilities for carefully tracking and reasoning over participants' knowledge
states.
  Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models reveals significant
challenges in handling participant-centric reasoning, specifically in
situations where participants have false beliefs. Models also struggle with
conversations containing distractors and show limited ability to identify
scenarios with insufficient information. These findings highlight current
models' ToM limitations in handling real-world multi-party conversations.

Motivation: 探讨AI证明助手是否具备类似人类的数学结构理解能力，尤其是组合推理能力。

Method: 引入Ineq-Comp基准，通过系统化变换（如变量复制、代数重写等）生成问题，测试多种证明助手（如DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）的表现。

Result: 大多数证明助手表现不佳，即使提供子问题证明，组合推理能力仍薄弱。DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B相对稳健，但性能仍下降20%。

Conclusion: 当前AI证明助手在组合推理上与人类数学直觉存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for
automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these
systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate
this question through the lens of mathematical inequalities -- a fundamental
tool across many domains. While modern provers can solve basic inequalities, we
probe their ability to handle human-intuitive compositionality. We introduce
Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic
transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and
multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find
that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle
significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness -- possibly
because it is trained to decompose the problems into sub-problems -- but still
suffers a 20\% performance drop (pass@32). Strikingly, performance remains poor
for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in
context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional
reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization
behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition.

Motivation: 探讨角色设定是否影响LLMs在心理欺凌攻击下的安全性。

Method: 通过模拟攻击框架，使用心理欺凌策略测试不同角色设定的LLMs。

Result: 某些角色设定（如低宜人性或责任心）显著增加模型的不安全输出，情感或讽刺类欺凌策略尤为有效。

Conclusion: 角色设定是LLMs安全的新风险点，需开发角色感知的安全评估与对齐策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where
they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such
persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial
manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim
to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an
attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying
tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality
traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of
adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as
weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's
susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or
sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly
effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a
novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware
safety evaluation and alignment strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了A-RAG的效率，同时保持了生成质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal method for
expanding the knowledge of large language models. To handle complex queries
more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the
generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases.
Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency
challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple
iterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved
contents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a
significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The
overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large
proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be
generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the
redundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval
results. Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up
the prefilling and decoding stages respectively. Additionally, we also propose
an instruction-driven module to further guide the model to more effectively
attend to each part of the content in a more suitable way for LLMs. Experiments
show that our approach achieves 2.79 and 2.33 times significant acceleration on
average for prefilling and decoding respectively while maintaining equal
generation quality.

Result: 训练成本仅为类似规模LLMs的0.1%，性能相当，并展示了在有限数据下定制LLMs的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用智能的扩展提供了新视角，避免了从头训练单一大型模型的复杂性。

Abstract: As higher-level intelligence emerges from the combination of modular
components with lower-level intelligence, many works combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) for collective intelligence. Such combination is achieved by
building communications among LLMs. While current systems primarily facilitate
such communication through natural language, this paper proposes a novel
paradigm of direct dense vector communication between LLMs. Our approach
eliminates the unnecessary embedding and de-embedding steps when LLM interact
with another, enabling more efficient information transfer, fully
differentiable optimization pathways, and exploration of capabilities beyond
human heuristics. We use such stripped LLMs as vertexes and optimizable seq2seq
modules as edges to construct LMNet, with similar structure as MLPs. By
utilizing smaller pre-trained LLMs as vertexes, we train a LMNet that achieves
comparable performance with LLMs in similar size with only less than 0.1%
training cost. This offers a new perspective on scaling for general
intelligence rather than training a monolithic LLM from scratch. Besides, the
proposed method can be used for other applications, like customizing LLM with
limited data, showing its versatility.

Result: 基于7B模型的ReasonManip表现出优异的泛化能力、跨领域迁移能力和透明可解释性。

Conclusion: 该范式有效推动了LMM驱动的机器人操作发展。

Abstract: Recent Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, especially in solving complex mathematical problems and realizing
accurate spatial perception. Our key insight is that these emerging abilities
can naturally extend to robotic manipulation by enabling LMMs to directly infer
the next goal in language via reasoning, rather than relying on a separate
action head. However, this paradigm meets two main challenges: i) How to make
LMMs understand the spatial action space, and ii) How to fully exploit the
reasoning capacity of LMMs in solving these tasks. To tackle the former
challenge, we propose a novel task formulation, which inputs the current states
of object parts and the gripper, and reformulates rotation by a new axis
representation instead of traditional Euler angles. This representation is more
compatible with spatial reasoning and easier to interpret within a unified
language space. For the latter challenge, we design a pipeline to utilize
cutting-edge LMMs to generate a small but high-quality reasoning dataset of
multi-round dialogues that successfully solve manipulation tasks for supervised
fine-tuning. Then, we perform reinforcement learning by trial-and-error
interactions in simulation to further enhance the model's reasoning abilities
for robotic manipulation. Our resulting reasoning model built upon a 7B
backbone, named ReasonManip, demonstrates three notable advantages driven by
its system-2 level reasoning capabilities: i) exceptional generalizability to
out-of-distribution environments, objects, and tasks; ii) inherent sim-to-real
transfer ability enabled by the unified language representation shared across
domains; iii) transparent interpretability connecting high-level reasoning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed paradigm and its potential to advance LMM-driven robotic manipulation.

Result: 模型在类别级别与人类情感结构高度相似，但在单项目级别表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs能大致捕捉高维情感结构，但在单项目级别仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that human emotions exhibit a high-dimensional,
complex structure. A full capturing of this complexity requires new approaches,
as conventional models that disregard high dimensionality risk overlooking key
nuances of human emotions. Here, we examined the extent to which the latest
generation of rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capture
these high-dimensional, intricate emotion structures, including capabilities
and limitations. Specifically, we compared self-reported emotion ratings from
participants watching videos with model-generated estimates (e.g., Gemini or
GPT). We evaluated performance not only at the individual video level but also
from emotion structures that account for inter-video relationships. At the
level of simple correlation between emotion structures, our results
demonstrated strong similarity between human and model-inferred emotion
structures. To further explore whether the similarity between humans and models
is at the signle item level or the coarse-categorical level, we applied Gromov
Wasserstein Optimal Transport. We found that although performance was not
necessarily high at the strict, single-item level, performance across video
categories that elicit similar emotions was substantial, indicating that the
model could infer human emotional experiences at the category level. Our
results suggest that current state-of-the-art MLLMs broadly capture the complex
high-dimensional emotion structures at the category level, as well as their
apparent limitations in accurately capturing entire structures at the
single-item level.

Conclusion: IDEAL有效平衡数据集，显著提升LLM在多领域任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance through
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse instructional datasets. When training
on multiple capabilities simultaneously, the mixture training dataset, governed
by volumes of data from different domains, is a critical factor that directly
impacts the final model's performance. Unlike many studies that focus on
enhancing the quality of training datasets through data selection methods, few
works explore the intricate relationship between the compositional quantity of
mixture training datasets and the emergent capabilities of LLMs. Given the
availability of a high-quality multi-domain training dataset, understanding the
impact of data from each domain on the model's overall capabilities is crucial
for preparing SFT data and training a well-balanced model that performs
effectively across diverse domains. In this work, we introduce IDEAL, an
innovative data equilibrium adaptation framework designed to effectively
optimize volumes of data from different domains within mixture SFT datasets,
thereby enhancing the model's alignment and performance across multiple
capabilities. IDEAL employs a gradient-based approach to iteratively refine the
training data distribution, dynamically adjusting the volumes of
domain-specific data based on their impact on downstream task performance. By
leveraging this adaptive mechanism, IDEAL ensures a balanced dataset
composition, enabling the model to achieve robust generalization and consistent
proficiency across diverse tasks. Experiments across different capabilities
demonstrate that IDEAL outperforms conventional uniform data allocation
strategies, achieving a comprehensive improvement of approximately 7% in
multi-task evaluation scores.

Abstract: As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications,
ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success,
large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small
perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions,
posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and
safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification
has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models
remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to
certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on
ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related
terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering
formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently
detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of
moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this
work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment
and content moderation.

Motivation: 现有N-TKG推理方法缺乏解释性，MT-Path旨在通过结合时序信息和多策略驱动来解决这一问题。

Result: 实验证明MT-Path在推理任务中具有高效性和解释性。

Conclusion: MT-Path通过多策略和语义依赖捕捉，显著提升了N-TKG推理的解释性和性能。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which utilize quadruples in the form of
(subject, predicate, object, timestamp) to describe temporal facts, have
attracted extensive attention. N-tuple TKGs (N-TKGs) further extend traditional
TKGs by utilizing n-tuples to incorporate auxiliary elements alongside core
elements (i.e., subject, predicate, and object) of facts, so as to represent
them in a more fine-grained manner. Reasoning over N-TKGs aims to predict
potential future facts based on historical ones. However, existing N-TKG
reasoning methods often lack explainability due to their black-box nature.
Therefore, we introduce a new Reinforcement Learning-based method, named
MT-Path, which leverages the temporal information to traverse historical
n-tuples and construct a temporal reasoning path. Specifically, in order to
integrate the information encapsulated within n-tuples, i.e., the
entity-irrelevant information within the predicate, the information about core
elements, and the complete information about the entire n-tuples, MT-Path
utilizes a mixture policy-driven action selector, which bases on three
low-level policies, namely, the predicate-focused policy, the
core-element-focused policy and the whole-fact-focused policy. Further, MT-Path
utilizes an auxiliary element-aware GCN to capture the rich semantic
dependencies among facts, thereby enabling the agent to gain a deep
understanding of each n-tuple. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and the explainability of MT-Path.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于细粒度方面规范的自动化评估方法，通过构建层次化方面分类法和FRAbench基准，开发了跨任务和多模态的评估工具GenEval。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法在任务、方面或模态上较为狭窄且一致性低，亟需一种通用且客观的评估框架。

Method: 提出层次化方面分类法（112个方面），构建FRAbench基准（60.4k样本，325k标签），并开发GenEval评估工具。

Result: GenEval与GPT-4o和专家标注者高度一致，能泛化到未见任务和模态，并揭示当前LMM评估的系统性弱点。

Conclusion: 细粒度方面规范是提升自动化评估通用性和客观性的关键，GenEval为多模态评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the open-ended outputs of large language models (LLMs) has become
a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality coverage
rapidly expand. Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in a
few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In
this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the
key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To do so,
we introduce a hierarchical aspect taxonomy spanning 112 aspects that unifies
evaluation across four representative settings - Natural Language Generation,
Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image
Generation. Building on this taxonomy, we create FRAbench, a benchmark
comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k aspect-level labels obtained from a
combination of human and LLM annotations. FRAbench provides the first
large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained
LMM judges. Leveraging FRAbench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator
generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i)
attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers
robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic
weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在罕见词汇处理中的局限性，并揭示神经元结构如何动态演化以支持罕见词汇的预测。

Method: 通过分析神经元结构在训练过程中的动态变化，识别罕见词汇神经元的特征行为及其在网络中的协调机制。

Result: 罕见词汇神经元表现出三阶段动态组织（平台期、幂律期和快速衰减期），形成选择性共激活的子网络，并与权重分布的重尾特性相关。

Conclusion: 罕见词汇神经元的功能特化可能与统计力学机制相关，为语言模型中的神经元分化提供了新的理解。

Abstract: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens
despite their importance in specialized domains. In this study, we identify
neuron structures with exceptionally strong influence on language model's
prediction of rare tokens, termed as rare token neurons, and investigate the
mechanism for their emergence and behavior. These neurons exhibit a
characteristic three-phase organization (plateau, power-law, and rapid decay)
that emerges dynamically during training, evolving from a homogeneous initial
state to a functionally differentiated architecture. In the activation space,
rare token neurons form a coordinated subnetwork that selectively co-activates
while avoiding co-activation with other neurons. This functional specialization
potentially correlates with the development of heavy-tailed weight
distributions, suggesting a statistical mechanical basis for emergent
specialization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reasoning BO的新框架，结合推理模型和多智能体系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提升贝叶斯优化（BO）的效果，并在10个任务中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BO方法易陷入局部最优且缺乏可解释性，因此需要一种能结合推理能力和上下文理解的新方法。

Method: 设计了Reasoning BO框架，整合LLMs的推理能力、多智能体系统和知识图谱，实时提供采样建议和科学理论支持。

Result: 在Direct Arylation任务中，Reasoning BO将产率提升至60.7%，显著优于传统BO的25.2%。小规模LLMs通过强化学习微调也能达到类似效果。

Conclusion: Reasoning BO展示了LLMs在优化场景中的强大潜力，为高效自动化科学实验提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the
optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO)
provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO
methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable
insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel
framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO
while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online
knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual
understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide
strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses,
Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical
insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of
superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our
approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions
and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability
to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and
hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the
search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful
reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For
example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%,
whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our
investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement
learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts. This
enhanced reasoning capability paves the way for more efficient automated
scientific experimentation while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: As the field progresses toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there
is a pressing need for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation frameworks
that go beyond aggregate performance metrics. This paper introduces a unified
rating system that jointly models the difficulty of individual test cases and
the competency of AI models (or humans) across vision, language, and action
domains. Unlike existing metrics that focus solely on models, our approach
allows for fine-grained, difficulty-aware evaluations through competitive
interactions between models and tasks, capturing both the long-tail
distribution of real-world challenges and the competency gap between current
models and full task mastery. We validate the generalizability and robustness
of our system through extensive experiments on multiple established datasets
and models across distinct AGI domains. The resulting rating distributions
offer novel perspectives and interpretable insights into task difficulty, model
progression, and the outstanding challenges that remain on the path to
achieving full AGI task mastery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多层级感知偏好学习（MAPL）框架，以解决现有RLHF方法在复杂多指令任务中表现不足的问题。通过利用提示输入中的潜在信号和跨样本偏好差异，MAPL显著提升了多指令能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法在复杂多指令任务中表现不足，且依赖大量人工标注或大型语言模型，导致资源消耗和潜在偏差。此外，现有技术忽略了提示输入中的潜在信号和跨样本偏好差异。

Method: 提出MAPL框架，通过构建多样化提示和多指令偏好对，分别学习样本内和样本间的偏好差异，并设计相应的训练目标函数。

Conclusion: MAPL框架通过利用被忽视的潜在信号和偏好差异，有效提升了多指令任务的性能，且适用于奖励建模和直接偏好优化范式。

Abstract: RLHF has emerged as a predominant approach for aligning artificial
intelligence systems with human preferences, demonstrating exceptional and
measurable efficacy in instruction following tasks; however, it exhibits
insufficient compliance capabilities when confronted with complex
multi-instruction tasks. Conventional approaches rely heavily on human
annotation or more sophisticated large language models, thereby introducing
substantial resource expenditure or potential bias concerns. Meanwhile,
alternative synthetic methods that augment standard preference datasets often
compromise the model's semantic quality. Our research identifies a critical
oversight in existing techniques, which predominantly focus on comparing
responses while neglecting valuable latent signals embedded within prompt
inputs, and which only focus on preference disparities at the intra-sample
level, while neglecting to account for the inter-sample level preference
differentials that exist among preference data. To leverage these previously
neglected indicators, we propose a novel Multi-level Aware Preference Learning
(MAPL) framework, capable of enhancing multi-instruction capabilities.
Specifically, for any given response in original preference data pairs, we
construct varied prompts with a preference relation under different conditions,
in order to learn intra-sample level preference disparities. Furthermore, for
any given original preference pair, we synthesize multi-instruction preference
pairs to capture preference discrepancies at the inter-sample level. Building
on the two datasets constructed above, we consequently devise two sophisticated
training objective functions. Subsequently, our framework integrates seamlessly
into both Reward Modeling and Direct Preference Optimization paradigms. Through
rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we empirically validate the
efficacy of our framework.

Abstract: Early cavemen relied on gestures, vocalizations, and simple signals to
coordinate, plan, avoid predators, and share resources. Today, humans
collaborate using complex languages to achieve remarkable results. What drives
this evolution in communication? How does language emerge, adapt, and become
vital for teamwork? Understanding the origins of language remains a challenge.
A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language
evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation.
Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals.
Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent
Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and
ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of
communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial
knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to
complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally
ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn
both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents
develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language:
arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and
compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors,
such as population size and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of
the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how
language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and
cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data,
code, and models publicly.

Conclusion: 论文通过量化推理深度和开发检测与缓解方法，有效解决了大型推理模型中的推理幻觉问题，为未来研究提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more
deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where
logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive
yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are
embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and
potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations
from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which
quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits
obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space,
effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep
reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA
dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage
fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior
steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD)
framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.
To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced
reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning
rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes
stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved
reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.

the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for
temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event

levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3
sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News,

non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal
reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and
summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在需要信任和与人类价值观对齐的角色中日益重要，理解其何时及为何进行欺骗成为关键研究重点。

Method: 基于游戏理论、行为经济学和社会认知的框架，开发了一套评估指标，并实现了一个全自动模拟平台，支持异构智能体群体和自适应行为。

Result: 实验发现，高级模型如GPT-4o具有更强的欺骗能力，但对他人谎言的防御能力较弱，表明欺骗技能可能比检测能力发展更快。

Conclusion: The Traitors为研究LLM在社交互动中的行为提供了一个可配置的测试平台，有助于更严谨地研究欺骗机制和对齐挑战。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly assume roles where trust and alignment with human
values are essential, understanding when and why they engage in deception has
become a critical research priority. We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent
simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe
deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language
model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the
traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden
identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground
the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics,
and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing
deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we
implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over
persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous
agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial
experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model)
reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior
deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others'
falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection
abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for
investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this
work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms,
alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.

features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our
approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly,
the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate
connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel
tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing

Result: CAIM在检索准确性、响应正确性、上下文连贯性和存储效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAIM展示了上下文感知能力，有望提升长期人机交互体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of artificial
intelligence (AI) and are a powerful enabler for interactive systems. However,
they still face challenges in long-term interactions that require adaptation
towards the user as well as contextual knowledge and understanding of the
ever-changing environment. To overcome these challenges, holistic memory
modeling is required to efficiently retrieve and store relevant information
across interaction sessions for suitable responses. Cognitive AI, which aims to
simulate the human thought process in a computerized model, highlights
interesting aspects, such as thoughts, memory mechanisms, and decision-making,
that can contribute towards improved memory modeling for LLMs. Inspired by
these cognitive AI principles, we propose our memory framework CAIM. CAIM
consists of three modules: 1.) The Memory Controller as the central decision
unit; 2.) the Memory Retrieval, which filters relevant data for interaction
upon request; and 3.) the Post-Thinking, which maintains the memory storage. We
compare CAIM against existing approaches, focusing on metrics such as retrieval
accuracy, response correctness, contextual coherence, and memory storage. The
results demonstrate that CAIM outperforms baseline frameworks across different
metrics, highlighting its context-awareness and potential to improve long-term
human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist developing program code
beside many other things, but can they support working with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) as well? Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of
Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to
determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in
Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible
set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different
aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench
framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers
and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs.
Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial
release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in
handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open
models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive
dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary
LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the
models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their
performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.

Conclusion: 结合合作博弈论和保形预测，为高风险机器学习应用提供了严格且灵活的不确定性解释工具。

Abstract: Cooperative game theory methods, notably Shapley values, have significantly
enhanced machine learning (ML) interpretability. However, existing explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks mainly attribute average model predictions, overlooking
predictive uncertainty. This work addresses that gap by proposing a novel,
model-agnostic uncertainty attribution (UA) method grounded in conformal
prediction (CP). By defining cooperative games where CP interval
properties-such as width and bounds-serve as value functions, we systematically
attribute predictive uncertainty to input features. Extending beyond the
traditional Shapley values, we use the richer class of Harsanyi allocations,
and in particular the proportional Shapley values, which distribute attribution
proportionally to feature importance. We propose a Monte Carlo approximation
method with robust statistical guarantees to address computational feasibility,
significantly improving runtime efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility
and interpretative depth of our approach. By combining cooperative game theory
and conformal prediction, we offer a rigorous, flexible toolkit for
understanding and communicating predictive uncertainty in high-stakes ML

*Liancheng Gong,Wang Zhu,Jesse Thomason,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDDLego+框架通过零样本方式迭代形式化部分可观测环境为PDDL，显著提升规划性能与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在部分可观测环境中因信息不全而失效，需解决这一现实挑战。

Method: 提出PDDLego+框架，迭代形式化、规划、扩展和优化PDDL表示，无需现有轨迹。

Result: 在两个文本模拟环境中，PDDLego+表现优异且对问题复杂度鲁棒，捕获的领域知识可解释且可复用。

Conclusion: PDDLego+为部分可观测环境提供高效、可解释的规划解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In planning, using LLMs not to predict plans but to formalize an environment
into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been shown to greatly
improve performance and control. While most work focused on fully observable
environments, we tackle the more realistic and challenging partially observable
environments where existing methods are incapacitated by the lack of complete
information. We propose PDDLego+, a framework to iteratively formalize, plan,
grow, and refine PDDL representations in a zero-shot manner, without needing
access to any existing trajectories. On two textual simulated environments, we
show that PDDLego+ not only achieves superior performance, but also shows
robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge
captured after a successful trial is interpretable and benefits future tasks.

### [280] [Enhancing LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13175)
*Siming Sun,Kai Zhang,Xuejun Jiang,Wenchao Meng,Qinmin Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构引导的跨模态对齐框架（SGCMA），通过利用时间序列和语言数据共享的状态转移图结构，提升时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了语言模型的核心能力在于建模整体序列结构，而非局部特征。论文认为跨模态对齐需要在序列层面保持结构一致性。

Method: SGCMA包含结构对齐和语义对齐两部分：结构对齐通过HMM和MEMM学习状态转移矩阵，语义对齐通过跨注意力机制和时间嵌入加权平均实现。

Result: 实验表明SGCMA在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SGCMA为时间序列预测中的跨模态对齐提供了一种新方法，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs)
for time series forecasting has predominantly employed linguistic-temporal
modality alignment strategies through token-level or layer-wise feature
mapping. However, these approaches fundamentally neglect a critical insight:
the core competency of LLMs resides not merely in processing localized token
features but in their inherent capacity to model holistic sequence structures.
This paper posits that effective cross-modal alignment necessitates structural
consistency at the sequence level. We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal
Alignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the
state-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as
sequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like
properties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment.
SGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic
Alignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from
text data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based
Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix
and annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the
temporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In
Semantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the
top-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are
derived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average
based on state probabilities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that SGCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a novel approach to
cross-modal alignment in time series forecasting.

TL;DR: ViPlan是首个开源视觉规划基准，比较了基于符号规划的VLM方法和直接使用VLM规划的方法，发现符号规划在需要精确图像基础的Blocksworld任务中表现更好，而直接VLM规划在需要常识知识的家庭机器人任务中更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较VLM基于符号规划与直接VLM规划的性能差异，并填补缺乏统一环境和评估协议的空白。

Method: 引入ViPlan基准，包含Blocksworld和家庭机器人任务，评估9种开源VLM家族及部分闭源模型。

Result: 符号规划在Blocksworld中表现更优，而直接VLM规划在家庭机器人任务中更有效；Chain-of-Thought提示对当前VLM视觉推理帮助有限。

Conclusion: ViPlan为视觉规划提供了标准化评估，揭示了不同方法在不同任务中的优势，并指出当前VLM在视觉推理上的局限性。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models with symbolic planners is a promising
direction for obtaining verifiable and grounded plans compared to planning in
natural language, with recent works extending this idea to visual domains using
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, rigorous comparison between
VLM-grounded symbolic approaches and methods that plan directly with a VLM has
been hindered by a lack of common environments, evaluation protocols and model
coverage. We introduce ViPlan, the first open-source benchmark for Visual
Planning with symbolic predicates and VLMs. ViPlan features a series of
increasingly challenging tasks in two domains: a visual variant of the classic
Blocksworld planning problem and a simulated household robotics environment. We
benchmark nine open-source VLM families across multiple sizes, along with
selected closed models, evaluating both VLM-grounded symbolic planning and
using the models directly to propose actions. We find symbolic planning to
outperform direct VLM planning in Blocksworld, where accurate image grounding
is crucial, whereas the opposite is true in the household robotics tasks, where
commonsense knowledge and the ability to recover from errors are beneficial.
Finally, we show that across most models and methods, there is no significant
benefit to using Chain-of-Thought prompting, suggesting that current VLMs still
struggle with visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对抗性评估框架，用于测试大型语言模型（LLMs）在交互和对抗条件下的决策能力，揭示了模型在策略适应性和公平性方面的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实决策系统中的广泛应用，理解其行为脆弱性对AI安全和对齐至关重要。现有评估指标多关注推理准确性，忽视了对抗性操纵和动态环境适应能力。

Method: 结合认知心理学和博弈论方法，设计了一个对抗性评估框架，通过两臂老虎机任务和多轮信任任务测试LLMs的探索-利用权衡、社会合作和策略灵活性。

Result: 测试了GPT-3.5、GPT-4、Gemini-1.5和DeepSeek-V3等模型，发现它们在操纵敏感性和策略适应性上存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为诊断LLM决策弱点提供了方法学支持，强调了适应性和公平性识别对可信AI部署的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world decision-making systems, understanding their behavioural
vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge for AI safety and alignment. While
existing evaluation metrics focus primarily on reasoning accuracy or factual
correctness, they often overlook whether LLMs are robust to adversarial
manipulation or capable of using adaptive strategy in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to
systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under
interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive
psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two
canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task.
These tasks capture key aspects of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, social
cooperation, and strategic flexibility. We apply this framework to several
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3,
revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in
strategy adaptation. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns across
models and emphasize the importance of adaptability and fairness recognition
for trustworthy AI deployment. Rather than offering a performance benchmark,
this work proposes a methodology for diagnosing decision-making weaknesses in
LLM-based agents, providing actionable insights for alignment and safety
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试简化了GUI grounding任务，未能捕捉真实交互的复杂性，如软件常识、布局理解和精细操作能力。

Method: 提出OSWorld-G基准和Jedi数据集，通过多尺度模型训练，并验证其在多个任务上的表现。

Result: 模型在ScreenSpot-v2、ScreenSpot-Pro和OSWorld-G上优于现有方法，并将基础模型的代理能力从5%提升至27%。

Conclusion: Jedi数据集和OSWorld-G基准显著提升了GUI grounding性能，并支持对新界面的组合泛化。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language
instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a
critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks
oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture
the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense,
layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address
these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching,
element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation.
Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding
dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective
decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its
effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2,
ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved
grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general
foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on
OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors
contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized
data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to
novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarFT是一种新的微调框架，通过防止零样本模型学习虚假特征来增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本模型在微调时容易学习虚假特征（如背景或纹理），导致鲁棒性下降。

Method: 提出StarFT框架，通过正则化将虚假标签的输出分布与原始零样本模型对齐，避免学习无关特征。

Result: 实验显示StarFT显著提升鲁棒性，在Waterbirds场景中，最差组和平均准确率分别提升14.30%和3.02%。

Conclusion: StarFT有效防止模型学习虚假特征，显著提升零样本模型的鲁棒性和分类性能。

Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led
to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained
robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other
downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this
phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that
aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a
different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to
learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.
In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a
novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by
preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that
aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original
zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant
features further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to
get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual
descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive
experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging
properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.
Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and
3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust
fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.

Result: 在COCO数据集上验证了EMoE的有效性，显示不确定性与图像质量强相关，并揭示了训练集中的偏差。

Conclusion: EMoE可作为解决AI生成内容公平性和问责问题的工具。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in text-to-image diffusion models is challenging
because of their large parameter counts (often exceeding 100 million) and
operation in complex, high-dimensional spaces with virtually infinite input
possibilities. In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a
novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion
models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional
training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a
latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty
better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset
demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between
uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled
languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the
training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for
addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.

Abstract: Bandit algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful
tools in artificial intelligence, each addressing distinct yet complementary
challenges in decision-making and natural language processing. This survey
explores the synergistic potential between these two fields, highlighting how
bandit algorithms can enhance the performance of LLMs and how LLMs, in turn,
can provide novel insights for improving bandit-based decision-making. We first
examine the role of bandit algorithms in optimizing LLM fine-tuning, prompt
engineering, and adaptive response generation, focusing on their ability to
balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale learning tasks.
Subsequently, we explore how LLMs can augment bandit algorithms through
advanced contextual understanding, dynamic adaptation, and improved policy
selection using natural language reasoning. By providing a comprehensive review
of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this
survey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the
way for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.

Result: 实验比较了所有方法，突出了其优缺点，并显著提升了规划与学习的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过结合符号启发式与RL，有效解决了现有问题，并在实验中取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Recent work investigated the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the
synthesis of heuristic guidance to improve the performance of temporal planners
when a domain is fixed and a set of training problems (not plans) is given. The
idea is to extract a heuristic from the value function of a particular
(possibly infinite-state) MDP constructed over the training problems.
  In this paper, we propose an evolution of this learning and planning
framework that focuses on exploiting the information provided by symbolic
heuristics during both the RL and planning phases. First, we formalize
different reward schemata for the synthesis and use symbolic heuristics to
mitigate the problems caused by the truncation of episodes needed to deal with
the potentially infinite MDP. Second, we propose learning a residual of an
existing symbolic heuristic, which is a "correction" of the heuristic value,
instead of eagerly learning the whole heuristic from scratch. Finally, we use
the learned heuristic in combination with a symbolic heuristic using a
multiple-queue planning approach to balance systematic search with imperfect
learned information. We experimentally compare all the approaches, highlighting
their strengths and weaknesses and significantly advancing the state of the art
for this planning and learning schema.

Motivation: 稀疏专家混合模型（SMoE）在扩展模型复杂度方面具有潜力，但传统路由机制存在效率不足的问题，导致训练效果不佳。

Method: 提出竞争机制（competition），通过路由令牌到具有最高神经响应的专家，并开发了CompeteSMoE算法，训练路由器学习竞争策略。

Result: 实验表明，CompeteSMoE在视觉指令调整和语言预训练任务中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CompeteSMoE是一种简单有效的SMoE训练方法，显著提升了性能，同时降低了训练开销。

Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the
model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width.
However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of
the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not
directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose
competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest
neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a
better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we
develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language
models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying
strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical
evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training
tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE
compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies. We have made the implementation
available at: https://github.com/Fsoft-AIC/CompeteSMoE. This work is an
improved version of the previous study at arXiv:2402.02526

brought dynamic progress in the field, particularly in i.i.d. scenarios, in
which models are trained and evaluated on the same data distributions.
Nevertheless, o.o.d. setups that assess model generalization to new test
distributions remain challenging even for the most recent models. To advance
generalization in AVR tasks, we present the Pathways of Normalized Group
Convolution model (PoNG), a novel neural architecture that features group
convolution, normalization, and a parallel design. We consider a wide set of
AVR benchmarks, including Raven's Progressive Matrices and visual analogy
problems with both synthetic and real-world images. The experiments demonstrate
strong generalization capabilities of the proposed model, which in several
settings outperforms the existing literature methods.

Motivation: 尽管人工智能在科学发现中有所应用，但尚未有系统能够完全自动化科学研究的全过程。Robin旨在填补这一空白，实现半自主的科学发现。

Method: Robin通过整合文献搜索智能体和数据分析智能体，生成假设、设计实验、解释结果并更新假设，形成一个迭代的科学发现流程。

Conclusion: Robin是首个在迭代实验室循环框架内自主发现并验证新治疗候选药物的AI系统，为AI驱动的科学发现树立了新范式。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background
research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite
recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific
discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single
workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of
fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By
integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can
generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and
generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific
discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment
for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness
in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium
phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a
promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating
dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of
phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment,
which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible
novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data
figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI
system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate
within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm
for AI-driven scientific discovery.

Conclusion: AutoMathKG通过自动更新和多源知识整合，显著提升了数学知识图谱的质量和实用性。

Abstract: A mathematical knowledge graph (KG) presents knowledge within the field of
mathematics in a structured manner. Constructing a math KG using natural
language is an essential but challenging task. There are two major limitations
of existing works: first, they are constrained by corpus completeness, often
discarding or manually supplementing incomplete knowledge; second, they
typically fail to fully automate the integration of diverse knowledge sources.
This paper proposes AutoMathKG, a high-quality, wide-coverage, and
multi-dimensional math KG capable of automatic updates. AutoMathKG regards
mathematics as a vast directed graph composed of Definition, Theorem, and
Problem entities, with their reference relationships as edges. It integrates
knowledge from ProofWiki, textbooks, arXiv papers, and TheoremQA, enhancing
entities and relationships with large language models (LLMs) via in-context
learning for data augmentation. To search for similar entities, MathVD, a
vector database, is built through two designed embedding strategies using
SBERT. To automatically update, two mechanisms are proposed. For knowledge
completion mechanism, Math LLM is developed to interact with AutoMathKG,
providing missing proofs or solutions. For knowledge fusion mechanism, MathVD
is used to retrieve similar entities, and LLM is used to determine whether to
merge with a candidate or add as a new entity. A wide range of experiments

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于经典力学的CoT-Kinetics能量方程，用于评估大型推理模型（LRM）生成推理轨迹的质量，从而更准确地衡量输出答案的置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估推理轨迹与答案的因果关系时表现不佳，仅依赖答案正确性不足以判断输出质量。

Method: 受经典力学启发，提出CoT-Kinetics能量方程，将LRM内部层的令牌状态转换过程建模为类似机械场中的粒子动力学。

Result: CoT-Kinetics能量方程能够为推理阶段分配标量分数，量化推理的合理性，从而更精确地评估答案的置信度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LRM输出质量的评估能力，超越了传统的二元判断（正确或错误）。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of
Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising
performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex
reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with
answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy
because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the
soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the
soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the
confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider
jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the
reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the
causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly
reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel
approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our
CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process,
which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle
kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy
assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning
phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated
reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately
measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore.

TL;DR: MM-PRM提出了一种基于过程奖励模型的方法，通过自动化的多步推理监督提升多模态大语言模型的逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂多步推理中表现不佳，缺乏对中间推理步骤的细粒度监督。

Method: 使用MM-Policy模型和MM-K12数据集，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成大量无标注的步骤级注释，训练过程奖励模型（PRM）。

Result: MM-PRM在多个基准测试中显著提升了推理性能，验证了软标签、小学习率和路径多样性的有效性。

Conclusion: 过程监督是增强多模态推理系统逻辑鲁棒性的有效工具。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex
multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially
correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained
supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose
MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable
framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on
diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated
dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which
serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based
pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling.
The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N
inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain
(MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.)
benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller
learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM
demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the
logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes
and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在复杂推理中存在“表面自我反思”问题，即模型无法有效验证自身输出。RISE旨在通过强化学习提升模型的自我验证能力。

Method: RISE是一个在线强化学习框架，利用可验证奖励机制，同时训练模型的生成解决方案和自我验证能力。模型在每次迭代中生成解决方案并自我评估，两者共同更新策略。

Result: 实验表明，RISE在多种数学推理基准测试中显著提升了模型的问题解决准确性和自我验证能力。

Conclusion: RISE为开发更鲁棒和自知的推理模型提供了一种灵活有效的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement
strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where
models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE
(Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework
designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to
improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a
single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging
verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for
both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the
model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated
solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive
experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE
consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently
fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the
advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification
compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate
self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE
as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware
reasoners.

Conclusion: PRIME框架成功整合了物理知识与数据驱动智能，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has been extensively applied to data
prediction during process ramp-up, with a particular focus on transistor
characteristics for circuit design and manufacture. However, capturing the
nonlinear current response across multiple operating regions remains a
challenge for neural networks. To address such challenge, a novel machine

proposed to capture and integrate complex regional characteristics. In essence,
our framework incorporates physics-based knowledge with data-driven
intelligence. By leveraging a dynamic weighting mechanism in its gating
network, PRIME adaptively activates the suitable expert model based on distinct
input data features. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various

TL;DR: PG-SOM是一种轻量级的二阶优化方法，用于强化学习策略，通过结合梯度平均和对角Hessian近似，显著提升了样本效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶优化方法在强化学习中可能效率较低且不稳定，因此需要一种轻量级的二阶优化方案来提升性能。

Method: PG-SOM在REINFORCE更新中引入了一阶梯度平均和对角Hessian近似，通过曲率估计对梯度进行自适应缩放。

Result: 实验表明，PG-SOM在标准控制基准上实现了2.1倍的样本效率提升，并显著降低了方差。

Conclusion: PG-SOM证明了即使是粗略的二阶信息也能带来显著的性能提升，且仅需D内存开销。

Abstract: We develop Policy Gradient with Second-Order Momentum (PG-SOM), a lightweight
second-order optimisation scheme for reinforcement-learning policies. PG-SOM
augments the classical REINFORCE update with two exponentially weighted
statistics: a first-order gradient average and a diagonal approximation of the
Hessian. By preconditioning the gradient with this curvature estimate, the
method adaptively rescales each parameter, yielding faster and more stable
ascent of the expected return. We provide a concise derivation, establish that
the diagonal Hessian estimator is unbiased and positive-definite under mild
regularity assumptions, and prove that the resulting update is a descent
direction in expectation. Numerical experiments on standard control benchmarks
show up to a 2.1x increase in sample efficiency and a substantial reduction in
variance compared to first-order and Fisher-matrix baselines. These results
indicate that even coarse second-order information can deliver significant
practical gains while incurring only D memory overhead for a D-parameter
policy. All code and reproducibility scripts will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Whilst there have been major advancements in the field of first order
optimisation of deep learning models, where state of the art open source
mixture of expert models go into the hundreds of billions of parameters,
methods that rely on Hessian vector products, are still limited to run on a

the well known Transformers package and allows for distributed hessian vector
computation across a single node with multiple GPUs. Underpinning our
implementation is a distributed stochastic lanczos quadrature algorithm, which
we release for public consumption. Using this package we investigate the

Motivation: 现有方法多基于复杂模型设计且针对特定数据集，缺乏通用性；同时时间域标签的强相关性违背了IID假设。

Method: 基于统计现象证明时间序列的信息熵高于其频谱熵，提出频域监督；结合傅里叶变换和小波变换捕捉长短期频率变化及空间特征；频域计算预测与目标的损失。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上验证，X-Freq无需修改原模型即可平均提升长短期预测性能3.3%和27.7%。

Conclusion: X-Freq具有优异的通用性和实用性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the
methods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch.
However, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model
architectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking
universality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically
distributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time
domain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we
propose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional
frequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we
first prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its
spectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus
can provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet
Transform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the
time series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency
variations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss
between predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain.
Moreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced
forecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original
architectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting
performance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7%
on short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code
will be released publicly.

Conclusion: 嵌入自适应性的CNN显著提高了鲁棒性和灵活性，适用于多样化的计算环境。

Abstract: Deploying deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained
devices presents significant challenges due to their high computational demands
and rigid, static architectures. To overcome these limitations, this thesis
explores methods for enabling CNNs to dynamically adjust their computational
complexity based on available hardware resources. We introduce adaptive CNN
architectures capable of scaling their capacity at runtime, thus efficiently
balancing performance and resource utilization. To achieve this adaptability,
we propose a structured pruning and dynamic re-construction approach that
creates nested subnetworks within a single CNN model. This approach allows the
network to dynamically switch between compact and full-sized configurations
without retraining, making it suitable for deployment across varying hardware
platforms. Experiments conducted across multiple CNN architectures including
VGG-16, AlexNet, ResNet-20, and ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 and Imagenette datasets
demonstrate that adaptive models effectively maintain or even enhance
performance under varying computational constraints. Our results highlight that
embedding adaptability directly into CNN architectures significantly improves
their robustness and flexibility, paving the way for efficient real-world
deployment in diverse computational environments.

Conclusion: T-ELLM框架为联邦学习中的设备选择提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，减少了交互成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge
devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends
on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in
dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a
confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning,
and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary
Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for
device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization
methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance
generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the
joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of
device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex
optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a
sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the
relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating
subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces
reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while
maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the
discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the
advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably
small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate
that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits
robust adaptability to environmental changes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH, and AIME. However, the
substantial computational demands of these tasks pose significant challenges
for real-world deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising
approach to reduce memory footprint and inference latency by representing
weights and activations with lower bit-widths. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive study of mainstream quantization methods(e.g., AWQ, GPTQ,
SmoothQuant) on the most popular open-sourced models (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3
series), and reveal that quantization can degrade mathematical reasoning
accuracy by up to 69.81%. To better understand this degradation, we develop an
automated assignment and judgment pipeline that qualitatively categorizes
failures into four error types and quantitatively identifies the most impacted
reasoning capabilities. Building on these findings, we employ an automated
data-curation pipeline to construct a compact "Silver Bullet" datasets.
Training a quantized model on as few as 332 carefully selected examples for
just 3-5 minutes on a single GPU is enough to restore its reasoning accuracy to
match that of the full-precision baseline.

Abstract: Neural networks are often black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge
of understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective
that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural
networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror
regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection
Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on
this insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking
to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units
that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these
emerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and
dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of
entities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond
to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels
are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting
entities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in
RNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with
diverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.
Throughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities
and concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities
in neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated
concepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that
harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to
reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually
transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation
discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields
through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation
model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A
fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to
effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation
residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient
evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning
process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical
consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show
that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating
spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further
reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is
developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.

Motivation: 多项式神经网络（PNNs）在隐私保护推理（如同态加密）中具有重要应用，但训练时低阶多项式限制表达能力，高阶多项式则易出现数值不稳定和梯度爆炸。

Method: 提出边界损失和选择性梯度裁剪两种创新方法，结合HE兼容层（如线性层、平均池化等）训练PNNs。

Result: 在多种数据集上，PNNs使用低阶多项式（如2阶）实现高精度，且在高阶（如22阶）下仍保持稳定训练和性能，接近ReLU基模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为准确、稳定且安全的深度学习推理提供了实用解决方案，并通过消融研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: By replacing standard non-linearities with polynomial activations, Polynomial
Neural Networks (PNNs) are pivotal for applications such as privacy-preserving
inference via Homomorphic Encryption (HE). However, training PNNs effectively
presents a significant challenge: low-degree polynomials can limit model
expressivity, while higher-degree polynomials, crucial for capturing complex
functions, often suffer from numerical instability and gradient explosion. We
introduce a robust and versatile training framework featuring two synergistic
innovations: 1) a novel Boundary Loss that exponentially penalizes activation
inputs outside a predefined stable range, and 2) Selective Gradient Clipping
that effectively tames gradient magnitudes while preserving essential Batch
Normalization statistics. We demonstrate our framework's broad efficacy by
training PNNs within deep architectures composed of HE-compatible layers (e.g.,
linear layers, average pooling, batch normalization, as used in ResNet
variants) across diverse image, audio, and human activity recognition datasets.
These models consistently achieve high accuracy with low-degree polynomial
activations (such as degree 2) and, critically, exhibit stable training and
strong performance with polynomial degrees up to 22, where standard methods
typically fail or suffer severe degradation. Furthermore, the performance of
these PNNs achieves a remarkable parity, closely approaching that of their
original ReLU-based counterparts. Extensive ablation studies validate the
contributions of our techniques and guide hyperparameter selection. We confirm
the HE-compatibility of the trained models, advancing the practical deployment
of accurate, stable, and secure deep learning inference.

Result: FP4注意力实现5倍加速，8-bit注意力在微调任务中表现无损，但在预训练任务中收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 低比特注意力在推理和微调任务中高效可行，但在预训练任务中需进一步优化。

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time
complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key
contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to
accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on
RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090.
Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various
models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training
tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention
focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is
also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied
to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both
forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention
achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower
convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). One of the most widely
used RL methods is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)~\cite{Shao-2024-Deepseekmath}, known for its memory efficiency and
success in training DeepSeek-R1~\cite{Guo-2025-Deepseek}. However, GRPO stalls
when all sampled responses in a group are incorrect -- referred to as an
\emph{all-negative-sample} group -- as it fails to update the policy, hindering
learning progress. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a simple yet effective framework that introduces response diversity
within all-negative-sample groups in GRPO using AI feedback. We also provide a
theoretical analysis, via a stylized model, showing how this diversification
improves learning dynamics. Second, we empirically validate our approach,
showing the improved performance across various model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in
both offline and online learning settings with 10 benchmarks, including base
and distilled variants. Our findings highlight that learning from
all-negative-sample groups is not only feasible but beneficial, advancing
recent insights from \citet{Xiong-2025-Minimalist}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过生成连续嵌入空间和强化学习解决特征选择中的排列敏感性和非凸性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互并适应多样场景，且存在排列敏感性和非凸性限制。

Result: 实验证明模型在有效性、效率、鲁棒性和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 新框架成功解决了特征选择中的关键限制，提升了性能。

Abstract: Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and
computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to
capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent
advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address
these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features.
However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a
continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in
feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process;
2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is
rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal
subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1)
preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while
ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space
without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we
develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge
into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions
through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of
feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is
introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second
objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to
guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively
navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing
high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity
assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local
optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,
robustness and explicitness of our model.

Motivation: 选择性SSMs因其输入依赖和时间变化参数具有强大表达能力，但稳定性分析困难，尤其是对不连续门控信号。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过被动性和ISS理论分析，建立能量耗散与状态遗忘的关系，推导参数LMI条件和核约束，限制门控机制。

Result: 证明了无激励系统动态具有最小二次能量函数，其矩阵具有鲁棒局部AUC正则性，适应不连续门控；提出了全局ISS的充分条件。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和设计稳定可靠的选择性SSMs提供了严格框架。

Abstract: Deep Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), characterized by input-dependent,
time-varying parameters, offer significant expressive power but pose challenges
for stability analysis, especially with discontinuous gating signals. In this
paper, we investigate the stability and regularity properties of
continuous-time selective SSMs through the lens of passivity and Input-to-State
Stability (ISS). We establish that intrinsic energy dissipation guarantees
exponential forgetting of past states. Crucially, we prove that the unforced
system dynamics possess an underlying minimal quadratic energy function whose
defining matrix exhibits robust $\text{AUC}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity,
accommodating discontinuous gating. Furthermore, assuming a universal quadratic
storage function ensures passivity across all inputs, we derive parametric LMI
conditions and kernel constraints that limit gating mechanisms, formalizing
"irreversible forgetting" of recurrent models. Finally, we provide sufficient
conditions for global ISS, linking uniform local dissipativity to overall
system robustness. Our findings offer a rigorous framework for understanding
and designing stable and reliable deep selective SSMs.

Result: 理论证明在核岭回归和神经网络中，几乎良性过拟合可以实现，且无需对回归函数或噪声做强假设。

Conclusion: 研究为理解神经网络泛化能力提供了新视角，并提出了避免均匀收敛陷阱的新分析技术。

Abstract: Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model
perfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet
still generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has
attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a
conceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models
simultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This
behavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but
non-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that
this almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by
analyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables
larger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach
Bayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical
evidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii)
least-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network
trained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions
often required in prior work on benign overfitting.
  Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result
in this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying
regression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a
novel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and
approximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer,
that helps avoid uniform convergence traps. This analysis idea could be of
independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时空图神经网络（STGNNs）在MTS预测中因计算复杂性和有限输入长度限制，难以识别全局相似模式，且对稀疏分布的相关性数据表现不佳。

Method: 提出kNN-MTS框架，利用MTS模型的表示进行相似性搜索，结合HSTEncoder捕捉长短期时空依赖关系。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，kNN-MTS显著提升了预测性能，并展示了其可解释性和高效性。

Conclusion: kNN-MTS为高效利用大规模数据集提供了新途径，具有更好的应用前景。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications
in both industry and academia. Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks
(STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current
STGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the
computational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar
patterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit
sparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an
extensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this
article, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting
( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval
mechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from
the MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional
training and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at
test time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves
performance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar
patterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a
hybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can
capture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies
and is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better
forecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a
significant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The
quantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of
kNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for
efficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.

Abstract: Extreme weather events are placing growing strain on electric power systems,
exposing the limitations of purely reactive responses and prompting the need
for proactive resilience planning. However, existing approaches often rely on
simplified uncertainty models and decouple proactive and reactive decisions,
overlooking their critical interdependence. This paper proposes a novel
tri-level optimization framework that integrates proactive infrastructure
investment, adversarial modeling of spatio-temporal disruptions, and adaptive
reactive response. We construct high-probability, distribution-free uncertainty
sets using conformal prediction to capture complex and data-scarce outage
patterns. To solve the resulting nested decision problem, we derive a bi-level
reformulation via strong duality and develop a scalable Benders decomposition
algorithm. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms conventional robust and two-stage methods,
achieving lower worst-case losses and more efficient resource allocation,
especially under tight operational constraints and large-scale uncertainty.

Conclusion: QGAN在量子计算环境下实现了高效的异常检测，性能优于经典方法，且对噪声具有鲁棒性，展示了量子计算在机器学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning,
including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In
this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN)
architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages
variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting
technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method
encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both
data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum
states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the
restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an
anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the
discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was
trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN.
Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high
along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower
MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this
performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a
compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach
remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.

Conclusion: GM-RBM是一种可扩展的离散潜在推理框架，具有更强的表达能力和互操作性。

Abstract: Many real-world tasks, from associative memory to symbolic reasoning, demand
discrete, structured representations that standard continuous latent models
struggle to express naturally. We introduce the Gaussian-Multinoulli Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (GM-RBM), a generative energy-based model that extends the
Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM (GB-RBM) by replacing binary hidden units with $q$-state
Potts variables. This modification enables a combinatorially richer latent
space and supports learning over multivalued, interpretable latent concepts. We
formally derive GM-RBM's energy function, learning dynamics, and conditional
distributions, showing that it preserves tractable inference and training
through contrastive divergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that GM-RBMs model
complex multimodal distributions more effectively than binary RBMs,
outperforming them on tasks involving analogical recall and structured memory.
Our results highlight GM-RBMs as a scalable framework for discrete latent
inference with enhanced expressiveness and interoperability.

Motivation: 传统B&C算法依赖手动调参的启发式策略，而机器学习（尤其是神经网络）逐渐被用于学习这些策略。本文旨在理解这些学习策略的理论基础，特别是其从有限数据中的泛化性能。

Method: 通过分析分段多项式结构的评分函数，建立了学习B&C策略的样本复杂度界限。这种结构涵盖了实践中常用的线性模型和现代神经网络架构（如ReLU激活）。

Conclusion: 本文的理论结果为B&C中学习策略的泛化性能提供了严格保证，为理论和实践的结合提供了基础。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for
optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&C) being the predominant
algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&C critically depends
on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node
selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional
solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent
approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks,
to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand
the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their
generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous
sample complexity bounds for learning B&C policies where the scoring functions
guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise
polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form
the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a
foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise
polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using
ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical
studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models
utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&C, offering a
unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical
research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general
sequential decision making problems beyond B&C.

Motivation: 现有方法多依赖监督或无监督学习，忽视了半监督学习在数据稀缺场景的潜力，且缺乏统一的多任务框架。

Method: 提出SemiGTX框架，结合融合编码模块处理多源地理空间数据，引入半信息损失函数，实现空间自监督与局部监督回归的结合。

Abstract: Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has
emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing
methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often
overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified
multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning
framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with
dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities,
seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a
semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with
locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective
region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps
GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model.
Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China
demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods,
achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and
Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how
different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability
while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This
representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through
diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise
economic forecasting.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了联邦学习中的噪声问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: We propose a robust aggregation method for model parameters in federated
learning (FL) under noisy communications. FL is a distributed machine learning
paradigm in which a central server aggregates local model parameters from
multiple clients. These parameters are often noisy and/or have missing values
during data collection, training, and communication between the clients and
server. This may cause a considerable drop in model accuracy. To address this
issue, we learn a graph that represents pairwise relationships between model
parameters of the clients during aggregation. We realize it with a joint
problem of graph learning and signal (i.e., model parameters) restoration. The
problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization, which is
efficiently solved via a proximal DC algorithm. Experimental results on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing
approaches by up to $2$--$5\%$ in classification accuracy under biased data
distributions and noisy conditions.

Result: 在多个城市的真实数据集上，UrbanMind表现优于现有基线方法，具有高准确性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanMind通过创新的模型设计和适应机制，显著提升了城市动态预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing
transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public
services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they
often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting
their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities,
yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored.
Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted
spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between
training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel
spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that
ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core,
UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with
specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal
dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics.
Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy
that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs'
ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve
generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data
reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by
reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world
urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust
generalization, even in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了先前的收敛性结果，还为步长的选择提供了更好的理论依据。

Abstract: Most prior work on the convergence of gradient descent (GD) for
overparameterized neural networks relies on strong assumptions on the step size
(infinitesimal), the hidden-layer width (infinite), or the initialization
(large, spectral, balanced). Recent efforts to relax these assumptions focus on
two-layer linear networks trained with the squared loss. In this work, we
derive a linear convergence rate for training two-layer linear neural networks
with GD for general losses and under relaxed assumptions on the step size,
width, and initialization. A key challenge in deriving this result is that
classical ingredients for deriving convergence rates for nonconvex problems,
such as the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, do not hold
globally for overparameterized neural networks. Here, we prove that these two
conditions hold locally with local constants that depend on the weights. Then,
we provide bounds on these local constants, which depend on the initialization
of the weights, the current loss, and the global PL and smoothness constants of
the non-overparameterized model. Based on these bounds, we derive a linear
convergence rate for GD. Our convergence analysis not only improves upon prior
results but also suggests a better choice for the step size, as verified
through our numerical experiments.

Abstract: We address the computational and theoretical limitations of existing
distributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),
particularly regarding the estimation of classification performance and
confidence without target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these
methods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to
adequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a
confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the
flexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport
alignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable, theoretically
rigorous, and computationally efficient. It provides principled uncertainty
estimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels without requiring model
retraining, and can flexibly adapt to varying degrees of available source
information. Experimental results on standard UDA benchmarks demonstrate that
classification accuracy consistently improves by identifying and removing
low-confidence predictions, and that OT score significantly outperforms
existing confidence metrics across diverse adaptation scenarios.

*Ananyae Kumar Bhartari,Vinayak Vinayak,Vivek B Shenoy*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mollifier Layers的轻量级模块，用于替代自动微分计算高阶导数，提高了内存效率、训练速度和参数恢复精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有物理约束机器学习方法中自动微分计算高阶导数不准确、内存消耗大且在噪声环境下表现不佳的问题。

Method: 使用卷积操作和解析定义的mollifiers替代自动微分，将导数计算重新定义为平滑积分。

Result: 在多种PDE任务中显著提升了内存效率、训练速度和参数恢复精度，并成功应用于生物医学数据的逆问题。

Conclusion: Mollifier Layers是一种高效且可扩展的物理约束学习工具。

Abstract: Parameter estimation in inverse problems involving partial differential
equations (PDEs) underpins modeling across scientific disciplines, especially
when parameters vary in space or time. Physics-informed Machine Learning
(PhiML) integrates PDE constraints into deep learning, but prevailing
approaches depend on recursive automatic differentiation (autodiff), which
produces inaccurate high-order derivatives, inflates memory usage, and
underperforms in noisy settings. We propose Mollifier Layers, a lightweight,
architecture-agnostic module that replaces autodiff with convolutional
operations using analytically defined mollifiers. This reframing of derivative
computation as smoothing integration enables efficient, noise-robust estimation
of high-order derivatives directly from network outputs. Mollifier Layers
attach at the output layer and require no architectural modifications. We
compare them with three distinct architectures and benchmark performance across
first-, second-, and fourth-order PDEs -- including Langevin dynamics, heat
diffusion, and reaction-diffusion systems -- observing significant improvements
in memory efficiency, training time and accuracy for parameter recovery across
tasks. To demonstrate practical relevance, we apply Mollifier Layers to infer
spatially varying epigenetic reaction rates from super-resolution chromatin
imaging data -- a real-world inverse problem with biomedical significance. Our
results establish Mollifier Layers as an efficient and scalable tool for
physics-constrained learning.

Motivation: 研究ReLU神经网络的结构特性，以更好地理解其表达能力、泛化性和鲁棒性，并为压缩、正则化和复杂度控制提供新方法。

Method: 构建RTG图，其中节点对应网络的线性区域，边连接激活模式仅差一个神经元翻转的区域，并通过图论分析RTG的几何性质。

Result: 提出了RTG大小和直径的紧组合界，证明了RTG的连通性，并将VC维度与图论联系起来，同时验证了RTG熵和平均度与泛化误差的关系。

Conclusion: 该研究首次通过图论统一分析了ReLU网络结构，为后续研究提供了新的理论基础和应用方向。

Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks
through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph
(RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the
network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a
single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new
theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization,
and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG
size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic
interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of
the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously
validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths,
widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of
ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression,
regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索神经网络如何实现离散符号过程，并填补深度学习与自动机理论之间的鸿沟。

Method: 方法包括理论证明ReLU和阈值网络可以精确模拟DFAs，并通过展开状态转移设计神经网络架构。

Result: 结果表明DFA转移是线性可分的，二进制阈值激活允许指数压缩，且Myhill-Nerode等价类可以嵌入连续潜在空间。

Conclusion: 结论是固定深度的前馈网络无法识别需要无限内存的非正则语言，但为神经符号计算提供了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: We present a complete theoretical and empirical framework establishing
feedforward neural networks as universal finite-state machines (N-FSMs). Our
results prove that finite-depth ReLU and threshold networks can exactly
simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs) by unrolling state transitions
into depth-wise neural layers, with formal characterizations of required depth,
width, and state compression. We demonstrate that DFA transitions are linearly
separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and
Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces
while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary:
fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages
requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we
provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural
architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep
learning, automata theory, and neural-symbolic computation, offering a rigorous
blueprint for how discrete symbolic processes can be realized in continuous
neural systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有量化方法在权重和激活量化中产生的误差问题，并进一步优化层间量化误差。

Method: 基于可解释的优化框架，交替进行误差校正和扩散，利用Cholesky分解高效求解最小二乘问题。

Result: 在Llama3家族的自回归语言生成模型中，Qronos在权重、激活和KV缓存量化中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Qronos是一种高效且兼容现有技术的量化算法，显著提升了量化模型的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization
algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos
not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation
quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our
iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization
framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each
step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal
update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient
implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares
problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing
transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and
weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using
recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods
when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

Motivation: 探索一种不同于对比方法的无监督表示学习方法，利用Wasserstein相关性实现数据压缩和增强不变性。

Method: 通过最大化输入与编码分布之间的Wasserstein相关性训练（自动）编码器，并利用Markov-Wasserstein核定义增强编码器以实现不变性。

Conclusion: Wasserstein相关性最大化是一种有效的无监督学习方法，能够实现数据压缩和增强不变性，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: This work investigates the use of Wasserstein correlation -- a normalized
measure of statistical dependence based on the Wasserstein distance between a
joint distribution and the product of its marginals -- for unsupervised
representation learning. Unlike, for example, contrastive methods, which
naturally cluster classes in the latent space, we find that an (auto)encoder
trained to maximize Wasserstein correlation between the input and encoded
distributions instead acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while
approximately preserving the topological and geometric properties of the input
distribution. More strikingly, we show that Wasserstein correlation
maximization can be used to arrive at an (auto)encoder -- either trained from
scratch, or else one that extends a frozen, pretrained model -- that is
approximately invariant to a chosen augmentation, or collection of
augmentations, and that still approximately preserves the structural properties
of the non-augmented input distribution. To do this, we first define the notion
of an augmented encoder using the machinery of Markov-Wasserstein kernels. When
the maximization objective is then applied to the augmented encoder, as opposed
to the underlying, deterministic encoder, the resulting model exhibits the
desired invariance properties. Finally, besides our experimental results, which
show that even simple feedforward networks can be imbued with invariants or
can, alternatively, be used to impart invariants to pretrained models under
this training process, we additionally establish various theoretical results
for optimal transport-based dependence measures. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）在大型语言模型（LLMs）的下游任务性能和人类价值观对齐方面带来显著提升，但仅更新5%至30%的参数即可实现，这种现象称为参数更新稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL在LLMs中参数更新稀疏性的现象及其原因，探索其普遍性和内在机制。

Method: 使用7种RL算法和10种不同家族的LLMs进行实验，分析参数更新的稀疏性及其分布特征。

Result: RL仅更新少量参数即可达到与全参数更新相近的性能，且不同实验条件下的子网络重叠率显著高于随机。

Conclusion: 参数更新稀疏性是RL在LLMs中的固有现象，主要由训练数据分布和策略接近预训练模型的技术驱动。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) yields substantial improvements in large language
models (LLMs) downstream task performance and alignment with human values.
Surprisingly, such large gains result from updating only a small subnetwork
comprising just 5 percent to 30 percent of the parameters, with the rest
effectively unchanged. We refer to this phenomenon as parameter update sparsity
induced by RL. It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments.
This sparsity is intrinsic and occurs without any explicit sparsity promoting
regularizations or architectural constraints. Finetuning the subnetwork alone
recovers the test accuracy, and, remarkably, produces a model nearly identical
to the one obtained via full finetuning. The subnetworks from different random
seeds, training data, and even RL algorithms show substantially greater overlap
than expected by chance. Our analysis suggests that this sparsity is not due to
updating only a subset of layers, instead, nearly all parameter matrices
receive similarly sparse updates. Moreover, the updates to almost all parameter
matrices are nearly full-rank, suggesting RL updates a small subset of
parameters that nevertheless span almost the full subspaces that the parameter
matrices can represent. We conjecture that the this update sparsity can be
primarily attributed to training on data that is near the policy distribution,
techniques that encourage the policy to remain close to the pretrained model,
such as the KL regularization and gradient clipping, have limited impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AC算法中，actor对critic的依赖使其成为双层优化问题，需要改进以提升稳定性和性能。

Method: 提出BLPO算法，嵌套更新critic以学习actor策略的最佳响应，并使用Nyström方法计算超梯度。

Result: 理论上证明BLPO在多项式时间内收敛到局部强Stackelberg均衡；实验显示其性能优于或与PPO相当。

Conclusion: BLPO通过双层优化和Nyström方法，显著提升了AC算法的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: The dependency of the actor on the critic in actor-critic (AC) reinforcement
learning means that AC can be characterized as a bilevel optimization (BLO)
problem, also called a Stackelberg game. This characterization motivates two
modifications to vanilla AC algorithms. First, the critic's update should be
nested to learn a best response to the actor's policy. Second, the actor should
update according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior
into account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian
vector product, a process that can be numerically unstable. We thus propose a
new algorithm, Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients
(BLPO), which uses nesting to account for the nested structure of BLO, and
leverages the Nystr\"om method to compute the hypergradient. Theoretically, we
prove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a
local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability,
assuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective. Empirically, we
demonstrate that BLPO performs on par with or better than PPO on a variety of
discrete and continuous control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在有效性、隐蔽性或实用性方面存在不足，EnvInjection旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过优化问题设计像素扰动，训练神经网络近似不可微的像素-截图映射，并使用投影梯度下降求解。

Result: 在多个网页数据集上验证了EnvInjection的高效性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EnvInjection是一种高效且实用的攻击方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with
webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the
webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to
induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to
as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited
effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these
limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the
rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source
code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the
perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate
the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key
challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values
and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate
gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to
approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the
reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage
datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly
outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: 尽管m-out-of-n自举法在多个领域广泛应用，但其在样本分位数估计中的理论保证尚不完善。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析m-out-of-n重采样得到的样本分位数估计量，证明了中心极限定理，并构造反例验证其紧性。进一步推导了Edgeworth展开和Berry Esseen界。

Result: 在温和矩条件下，证明了数据驱动的估计量的中心极限定理，并展示了其紧性。通过Edgeworth展开提供了精确收敛速率。

Conclusion: 本文的理论结果为现代估计和学习任务中的实用统计量提供了参数无关的渐近分布，验证了m-out-of-n自举法的有效性。

Abstract: The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet
(1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m
subsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original
sample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with
heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications.
Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine
learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the
m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.
  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample
quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first
prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator
that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance
parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by
constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the
assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact
convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap
approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by
deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics,
including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of
ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our
theory in modern estimation and learning tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了不确定性估计的效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs)
during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and
simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple
sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues
that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility
of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation.
Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned
confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between
their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our
distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of
an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves
N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the
number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training
data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation
technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than)
state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.

Conclusion: 有效的令牌级不确定性估计不仅是评估LLMs推理生成质量的工具，还能显著提升其性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities,
their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios,
making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex
tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level
uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve
their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce
low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive
distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then
aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated
sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty
demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with
answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using
uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through
multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach
consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing
effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and
improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

Result: 在基准数据集上，新方法在公平性和预测准确性上优于或匹配现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: 新方法稳定、高效，适用于实际应用，且不会导致性能下降。

Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing
importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes
decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning
or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning
can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the
characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned
representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high
effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we
achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods.
Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that
guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance
degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive
accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and
computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: POCAII是一种新型超参数优化算法，通过明确分离搜索和评估阶段，并在两个阶段采用探索与利用原则，显著提升了低预算下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超参数优化算法（如Hyperband和Successive Halving）未明确区分搜索与评估阶段，导致资源分配不够灵活。POCAII旨在解决这一问题，特别适用于资源有限的实际场景。

Method: POCAII将搜索和评估阶段分离，初期侧重生成配置（搜索），后期增加评估资源。采用探索与利用原则优化资源分配。

Result: 在低预算条件下，POCAII表现优于SMAC、BOHB和DEHB，且结果更稳健、方差更低。

Conclusion: POCAII为资源有限的超参数优化提供了高效解决方案，尤其适用于训练成本高昂的模型。

Abstract: In this paper we propose for the first time the hyperparameter optimization
(HPO) algorithm POCAII. POCAII differs from the Hyperband and Successive
Halving literature by explicitly separating the search and evaluation phases
and utilizing principled approaches to exploration and exploitation principles
during both phases. Such distinction results in a highly flexible scheme for
managing a hyperparameter optimization budget by focusing on search (i.e.,
generating competing configurations) towards the start of the HPO process while
increasing the evaluation effort as the HPO comes to an end.
  POCAII was compared to state of the art approaches SMAC, BOHB and DEHB. Our
algorithm shows superior performance in low-budget hyperparameter optimization
regimes. Since many practitioners do not have exhaustive resources to assign to
HPO, it has wide applications to real-world problems. Moreover, the empirical
evidence showed how POCAII demonstrates higher robustness and lower variance in
the results. This is again very important when considering realistic scenarios
with extremely expensive models to train.

Abstract: Momentum-based gradients are essential for optimizing advanced machine
learning models, as they not only accelerate convergence but also advance
optimizers to escape stationary points. While most state-of-the-art momentum
techniques utilize lower-order gradients, such as the squared first-order
gradient, there has been limited exploration of higher-order gradients,
particularly those raised to powers greater than two. In this work, we
introduce the concept of high-order momentum, where momentum is constructed
using higher-power gradients, with a focus on the third-power of the
first-order gradient as a representative case. Our research offers both
theoretical and empirical support for this approach. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that incorporating third-power gradients can improve the
convergence bounds of gradient-based optimizers for both convex and smooth
nonconvex problems. Empirically, we validate these findings through extensive
experiments across convex, smooth nonconvex, and nonsmooth nonconvex
optimization tasks. Across all cases, high-order momentum consistently
outperforms conventional low-order momentum methods, showcasing superior
performance in various optimization problems.

Result: 理论表明排列随机化能破坏梯度优化器的收缩行为，促进全局收敛；实验验证其优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 排列随机化在理论和实践中均有效，为更广泛的随机化研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: While gradient-based optimizers that incorporate randomization often showcase
superior performance on complex optimization, the theoretical foundations
underlying this superiority remain insufficiently understood. A particularly
pressing question has emerged: What is the role of randomization in
dimension-free nonsmooth nonconvex optimization? To address this gap, we
investigate the theoretical and empirical impact of permutation randomization
within gradient-based optimization frameworks, using it as a representative
case to explore broader implications. From a theoretical perspective, our
analyses reveal that permutation randomization disrupts the shrinkage behavior
of gradient-based optimizers, facilitating continuous convergence toward the
global optimum given a sufficiently large number of iterations. Additionally,
we prove that permutation randomization can preserve the convergence rate of
the underlying optimizer. On the empirical side, we conduct extensive numerical
experiments comparing permutation-randomized optimizer against three baseline
methods. These experiments span tasks such as training deep neural networks
with stacked architectures and optimizing noisy objective functions. The
results not only corroborate our theoretical insights but also highlight the
practical benefits of permutation randomization. In summary, this work delivers
both rigorous theoretical justification and compelling empirical evidence for
the effectiveness of permutation randomization. Our findings and evidence lay a
foundation for extending analytics to encompass a wide array of randomization.

### [338] [Feature Hedging: Correlated Features Break Narrow Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11756)
*David Chanin,Tomáš Dulka,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）在特征相关且数量超过其宽度时，会将相关特征合并，破坏单义性，称为特征对冲。论文通过理论和实验研究此现象，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏自编码器（SAE）在特征相关且数量超过其宽度时表现不佳的原因，即特征对冲现象。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究特征对冲现象，并提出改进的嵌套稀疏自编码器（matryoshka SAEs）。

Result: 发现特征对冲是SAE表现不佳的核心原因，改进的SAE变体有望提升性能。

Conclusion: 特征对冲是SAE的根本问题，但通过研究此现象，未来有望改进SAE以更好地解释大规模语言模型。

Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic
activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations
are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we
find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true
features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features,
the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying
monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true.
This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction
loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the
problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and
empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one
of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines.
Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved
variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with
SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze
future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting
LLMs at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习允许设备在分布式数据上协作训练模型，但现有算法在传播OOD知识时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 通过分析OOD知识在拓扑结构中的传播问题，提出拓扑感知的聚合策略。

Result: 提出的策略将OOD数据的准确性平均提升了123%。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知的聚合策略能显著提升去中心化学习中OOD知识的传播效果。

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across
naturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a
global model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication
topologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each
device maintains its own local model by training on its local data and
integrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore,
knowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds.
We study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD)
knowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to
propagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both
the location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself,
significantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware
aggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across
devices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to
topology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Schrödingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO)，通过将神经算子重新定义在d+1维域上，更好地捕捉目标系统的演化过程，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算子在嵌入空间中的演化机制不明确，限制了其完全捕捉目标系统演化的能力。

Method: 基于量子模拟PDE的突破，重新定义神经算子为d+1维域，并实现SKNO模型。

Result: SKNO在实验中表现优于其他方法，并在基准测试和零样本超分辨率任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 重新定义的神经算子框架与d+1维演化对齐，验证了模型的有效性。

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between
function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely
validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent
advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to
better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$
dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the
embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully
capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential
equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural
operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$
dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed
Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$
dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear
block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on
various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In
addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators
on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment
between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过因果机制分析可以预测语言模型在分布外数据上的行为，并提出两种方法（反事实模拟和值探测）优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否可以通过解释性技术预测模型在分布外数据上的行为。

Method: 提出两种基于因果机制的方法：反事实模拟和值探测。

Result: 两种方法在分布内和分布外数据上均表现优异，AUC-ROC较高。

Conclusion: 内部因果分析为语言模型行为预测提供了新的重要应用。

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying
abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to
predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work,
we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of
language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval,
and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for
correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the
model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal
mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual
simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value
probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve
high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on
causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting
model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and
significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

TL;DR: REFINE方法通过结合固定源域表示和可训练目标域编码器，有效缓解负迁移问题，提升跨域任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法中，直接使用预训练模型特征可能导致负迁移，即源域表示与目标域分布不匹配。

Method: 提出REFINE方法，结合固定源域表示和可训练目标域编码器，通过浅层神经网络调整联合表示以适应目标域。

Result: 理论证明REFINE可避免负迁移，实验显示其在视觉、文本和表格数据上表现优异。

Conclusion: REFINE是一种轻量级、架构无关且鲁棒的方法，为迁移学习工具箱提供了有效补充。

Abstract: Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source
domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract
features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target
prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the
source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this
article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet
effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines
a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and
fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which
adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the
source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent
negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound
demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE
consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data
modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous
alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and
robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning
toolbox.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAMP是一种通过局部线性模型近似语言模型决策表面的方法，用于研究模型如何可靠地将自述原因映射到预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示语言模型如何将自述的解释因素映射到其预测中，并评估其可靠性。

Method: LAMP将模型的自述解释作为坐标系，拟合局部线性替代模型，连接这些权重与模型输出。

Result: LAMP发现许多语言模型具有局部线性决策表面，且这些表面与人类对解释质量的判断一致。

Conclusion: LAMP是一种轻量级框架，适用于审计专有语言模型，评估模型行为是否与其提供的解释一致。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LAMP} (\textbf{L}inear \textbf{A}ttribution
\textbf{M}apping \textbf{P}robe), a method that shines light onto a black-box
language model's decision surface and studies how reliably a model maps its
stated reasons to its predictions through a locally linear model approximating
the decision surface. LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as
a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those
weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors
steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks:
\textit{sentiment analysis}, \textit{controversial-topic detection}, and
\textit{safety-prompt auditing}. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many
LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces
correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical
case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without
requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves
as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language
models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with
the explanations it provides.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in mathematical
problem-solving, but evaluation has largely focused on problems that have exact
analytical solutions or involve formal proofs, often overlooking
approximation-based problems ubiquitous in applied science and engineering. To
fill this gap, we build on prior work and present HARDMath2, a dataset of 211
original problems covering the core topics in an introductory graduate applied
math class, including boundary-layer analysis, WKB methods, asymptotic
solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the asymptotics of
oscillatory integrals. This dataset was designed and verified by the students
and instructors of a core graduate applied mathematics course at Harvard. We
build the dataset through a novel collaborative environment that challenges
students to write and refine difficult problems consistent with the class
syllabus, peer-validate solutions, test different models, and automatically
check LLM-generated solutions against their own answers and numerical ground
truths. Evaluation results show that leading frontier models still struggle
with many of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the
mathematical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Importantly, students identified
strategies to create increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the
models and exploiting common failure modes. This back-and-forth with the models
not only resulted in a richer and more challenging benchmark but also led to
qualitative improvements in the students' understanding of the course material,
which is increasingly important as we enter an age where state-of-the-art
language models can solve many challenging problems across a wide domain of
fields.

Conclusion: 该模型通过整合对比学习和生成方法的优势，显著提升了图自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph
representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such
as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is
particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL
methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each
excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on
classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction.
In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates
the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware
node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive
and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning
to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive
augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and
edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By
incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance
across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link
prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of
0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.

Motivation: 傅里叶变换和小波变换在捕捉多尺度、时间敏感模式时存在不足，尤其是小波变换对时间变化点不敏感。论文旨在通过WDT提取时间感知模式，优化建模效果。

Method: 引入多阶小波导数变换（WDT），基于小波变换提取时间感知模式，并将其嵌入多分支框架WaveTS中，通过分解、优化和重构时间序列实现预测。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，WaveTS实现了最先进的预测精度，同时保持了较高的计算效率。

Conclusion: WDT和WaveTS框架有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为时间序列预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively
employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in
capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform
(WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its
coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to
suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the
multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the
extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle
fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series,
the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying
rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly
informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a
multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into
multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and
reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive
experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: 加权聚合框架在保持有效性的同时，显著提升了预测集的覆盖精度。

Abstract: Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by
augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets, assuming
exchangeability. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or
data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a
prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving
precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual
$1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically
resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a
framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are
assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework
offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter
coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the
combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending
on the distribution of weights. We extend our framework to data-dependent
weights, and we derive a general procedure for data-dependent weight
aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic and real data in
the mixture-of-experts setting, and we show that aggregation with
data-dependent weights provides a form of adaptive coverage.

Result: JULI在仅知前5个令牌对数概率的黑盒设置下，能有效破解API调用的LLMs，并在多个指标上优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: JULI为破解安全对齐的LLMs提供了一种高效且实用的方法，尤其适用于黑盒设置下的专有模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with safety alignment to prevent
generating malicious content. Although some attacks have highlighted
vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations,
such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process.
Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such
permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this
paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks
LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block,
BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted
token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a
black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our
approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.

Result: 在多个健康预测任务中表现优异，适用于多视图和多模态场景。

Conclusion: Diffmv有效解决了EHR数据中的视图缺失和惰性问题，显著提升了多视图利用效果。

Abstract: Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient
outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize
various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab
tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume
the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully
leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views
and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further
improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we
introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed
to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to
address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a
unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual
conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To
mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses
the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of
various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior
performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular
datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein
function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have
been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and
function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding
protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured
by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale
benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein
pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three
major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level
binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise
functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding
sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features
over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro,
BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three
sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment
of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source
models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure
hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their
performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings
using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation
for future research. Code and data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 回合级信用分配策略有效提升了LLM代理在多回合复杂决策任务中的推理能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Specifically, we focus on multi-turn tool-use scenarios, which can be naturally
modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While existing approaches often
train multi-turn LLM agents with trajectory-level advantage estimation in
bandit settings, they struggle with turn-level credit assignment across
multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on multi-turn reasoning
tasks. To address this, we introduce a fine-grained turn-level advantage
estimation strategy to enable more precise credit assignment in multi-turn
agent interactions. The strategy is general and can be incorporated into
various RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO).
Our experimental evaluation on multi-turn reasoning and search-based tool-use
tasks with GRPO implementations highlights the effectiveness of the MDP

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Var-RUOT的新框架，用于解决高维系统中从少量快照恢复动态的问题，通过结合最优条件和损失函数设计，提高了稳定性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决高维系统动态恢复问题时，往往无法满足最优条件，导致稳定性差和收敛困难。

Method: Var-RUOT通过将最优条件融入搜索空间参数化和损失函数设计，仅需学习一个标量场即可解决问题，并提出了改进的生长惩罚函数选择方法。

Result: 在模拟数据和真实单细胞数据集上验证，Var-RUOT相比现有算法能更快收敛、更稳定，且找到更低动作的解。

Conclusion: Var-RUOT为解决高维系统动态恢复问题提供了一种更稳定、更高效的方法，尤其在生物计算领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Recovering the dynamics from a few snapshots of a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task in statistical physics and machine learning, with important
applications in computational biology. Many algorithms have been developed to
tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the
Schr\"odinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced
Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and
unnormalized distributions. However, since many existing methods do not
explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to
satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a
stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT
(Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the
optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the
parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT
only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for
solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a
growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and
proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT. We
validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real
single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find
solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved
training stability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自校正框架，通过引入潜在变量标记推理步骤的真实性，结合离散搜索算法（Search Corrector）和摊销校正器（Amortized Corrector），显著提升了语言模型的推理准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理中的错误陈述会降低性能和可信度，需要一种方法动态校正推理步骤的真实性。

Method: 提出自校正框架，为每个推理步骤引入潜在变量表示其真实性；设计Search Corrector算法进行高效推理，并利用LM的联合似然作为奖励；通过伪标签训练Amortized Corrector实现零样本校正。

Result: Search Corrector在逻辑（ProntoQA）和数学推理（GSM8K）任务中有效识别错误；Amortized Corrector零样本准确率接近Search Corrector，并将最终答案准确率提升25%。

Conclusion: 自校正框架通过动态建模推理步骤的真实性，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力和可信度，为复杂任务提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and
transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain
inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address
this, we introduce a new self-correction framework that augments each reasoning
step in a CoT with a latent variable indicating its veracity, enabling modeling
of all possible truth assignments rather than assuming correctness throughout.
To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Search Corrector, a
discrete search algorithm over boolean-valued veracity assignments. It
efficiently performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior
distribution over veracity assignments by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood
over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient
inference-time correction method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an
Amortized Corrector by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. The Amortized
Corrector generalizes self-correction, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity
inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that Search
Corrector reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA) and mathematical
reasoning (GSM8K) benchmarks. The Amortized Corrector achieves comparable
zero-shot accuracy and improves final answer accuracy by up to 25%.

Motivation: 当前对SAEs的研究多为实证，缺乏理论支持，且对其实际效用存在质疑。本文旨在通过理论分析提升对SAEs的理解。

Method: 利用分段理论框架分析SAEs，提出PAM-SGD算法进行训练，并在MNIST和LLM实验中验证。

Result: SAEs在准确性和可解释性之间存在权衡，PAM-SGD算法在样本效率和稀疏性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SAEs的理论框架和PAM-SGD算法为稀疏自编码器的研究提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have received considerable recent attention as
tools for mechanistic interpretability, showing success at extracting
interpretable features even from very large LLMs. However, this research has
been largely empirical, and there have been recent doubts about the true
utility of SAEs. In this work, we seek to enhance the theoretical understanding
of SAEs, using the spline theory of deep learning. By situating SAEs in this
framework: we discover that SAEs generalise ``$k$-means autoencoders'' to be
piecewise affine, but sacrifice accuracy for interpretability vs. the optimal
``$k$-means-esque plus local principal component analysis (PCA)'' piecewise
affine autoencoder. We characterise the underlying geometry of (TopK) SAEs
using power diagrams. And we develop a novel proximal alternating method SGD
(PAM-SGD) algorithm for training SAEs, with both solid theoretical foundations
and promising empirical results in MNIST and LLM experiments, particularly in
sample efficiency and (in the LLM setting) improved sparsity of codes. All code

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on huge datasets, some
including sensitive information. This poses a serious privacy concern because
privacy attacks such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) may detect this
sensitive information. While knowledge distillation compresses LLMs into
efficient, smaller student models, its impact on privacy remains underexplored.
In this paper, we investigate how knowledge distillation affects model
robustness against MIA. We focus on two questions. First, how is private data
protected in teacher and student models? Second, how can we strengthen privacy
preservation against MIAs in knowledge distillation? Through comprehensive
experiments, we show that while teacher and student models achieve similar
overall MIA accuracy, teacher models better protect member data, the primary
target of MIA, whereas student models better protect non-member data. To
address this vulnerability in student models, we propose 5 privacy-preserving
distillation methods and demonstrate that they successfully reduce student
models' vulnerability to MIA, with ensembling further stabilizing the
robustness, offering a reliable approach for distilling more secure and
efficient student models. Our implementation source code is available at

Motivation: 尽管AdamW在训练大型语言模型中表现出色，但其收敛行为的理论理解尚不充分。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究了AdamW的收敛速率，并将其与SGD的最优收敛速率进行比较。

Result: 理论证明了AdamW的收敛速率为$O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{K^{1/4}})$，实验结果显示其与SGD的最优收敛速率类似。

Conclusion: AdamW的收敛行为在理论上与SGD的最优收敛速率相似，为其在实践中的成功提供了理论支持。

Abstract: As the default optimizer for training large language models, AdamW has
achieved remarkable success in deep learning. However, its convergence behavior
is not theoretically well-understood. This paper establishes the convergence
rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_1\right]\leq
O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{K^{1/4}})$ for AdamW measured by $\ell_1$ norm, where $K$
represents the iteration number, $d$ denotes the model dimension, and $C$
matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we
have $E\left[\|\nabla f(x)\|_1\right]\geq\sqrt{\frac{2d}{\pi}}E\left[\|\nabla
f(x)\|_2\right]$ when each element of $\nabla f(x)$ is generated from Gaussian
distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. Empirically, our experimental results on
real-world deep learning tasks reveal $\|\nabla
f(x)\|_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d})\|\nabla f(x)\|_2$. Both support that our
convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal
$\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_2\right]\leq
O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中子网络的性质及其对学习过程的影响，特别是通过代数几何的视角理解其几何结构和动态行为。

Method: 采用代数几何方法，分析全连接网络和多项式激活函数下的子网络参数化空间（neuromanifold），计算其维度和奇异性，并扩展到卷积网络。

Result: 发现子网络参数化的函数空间维度较低且具有奇异性，这些奇异性通常对应训练动态的临界点；卷积网络中虽存在类似关系，但偏差不显著。

Conclusion: 子网络的几何特性（如奇异性）对深度神经网络的训练动态有重要影响，而卷积网络的偏差行为与全连接网络不同。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often infer sparse representations, converging to a
subnetwork during the learning process. In this work, we theoretically analyze
subnetworks and their bias through the lens of algebraic geometry. We consider
fully-connected networks with polynomial activation functions, and focus on the
geometry of the function space they parametrize, often referred to as
neuromanifold. First, we compute the dimension of the subspace of the
neuromanifold parametrized by subnetworks. Second, we show that this subspace
is singular. Third, we argue that such singularities often correspond to
critical points of the training dynamics. Lastly, we discuss convolutional
networks, for which subnetworks and singularities are similarly related, but
the bias does not arise.

Motivation: 数字孪生（DT）在预测分析中具有强大潜力，但模拟与现实系统之间的现实差距（reality gap）削弱了其可靠性，尤其是上下文不匹配问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出RGA模块，通过持续集成传感器数据、检测不一致状态，并利用查询-响应框架重新校准DT，结合领域对抗深度学习和降阶模拟器指导。

Conclusion: RGA模块为数字孪生提供了一种有效解决现实差距的方法，结合数据驱动和物理一致性约束，提升了DT的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) enable powerful predictive analytics, but persistent
discrepancies between simulations and real systems--known as the reality
gap--undermine their reliability. Coined in robotics, the term now applies to
DTs, where discrepancies stem from context mismatches, cross-domain
interactions, and multi-scale dynamics. Among these, context mismatch is
pressing and underexplored, as DT accuracy depends on capturing operational
context, often only partially observable. However, DTs have a key advantage:
simulators can systematically vary contextual factors and explore scenarios
difficult or impossible to observe empirically, informing inference and model
alignment. While sim-to-real transfer like domain adaptation shows promise in
robotics, their application to DTs poses two key challenges. First, unlike
one-time policy transfers, DTs require continuous calibration across an asset's
lifecycle--demanding structured information flow, timely detection of
out-of-sync states, and integration of historical and new data. Second, DTs
often perform inverse modeling, inferring latent states or faults from
observations that may reflect multiple evolving contexts. These needs strain
purely data-driven models and risk violating physical consistency. Though some
approaches preserve validity via reduced-order model, most domain adaptation
techniques still lack such constraints. To address this, we propose a Reality
Gap Analysis (RGA) module for DTs that continuously integrates new sensor data,
detects misalignments, and recalibrates DTs via a query-response framework. Our
approach fuses domain-adversarial deep learning with reduced-order simulator
guidance to improve context inference and preserve physical consistency. We
illustrate the RGA module in a structural health monitoring case study on a
steel truss bridge in Pittsburgh, PA, showing faster calibration and better
real-world alignment.

Conclusion: Q-Policy为未来量子设备上的可扩展强化学习提供了理论支持，超越了经典方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose Q-Policy, a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that mathematically accelerates policy evaluation and optimization by
exploiting quantum computing primitives. Q-Policy encodes value functions in
quantum superposition, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple
state-action pairs via amplitude encoding and quantum parallelism. We introduce
a quantum-enhanced policy iteration algorithm with provable polynomial
reductions in sample complexity for the evaluation step, under standard
assumptions. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and theoretical soundness
of our approach, we validate Q-Policy on classical emulations of small discrete
control tasks. Due to current hardware and simulation limitations, our
experiments focus on showcasing proof-of-concept behavior rather than
large-scale empirical evaluation. Our results support the potential of Q-Policy
as a theoretical foundation for scalable RL on future quantum devices,
addressing RL scalability challenges beyond classical approaches.

Conclusion: 该研究为高维和多元价值环境中的对齐行为学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior
with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking
the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent
vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a
Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and
establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure.
We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering
$\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret
formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting.
Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization
using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between
practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a
principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and
value-pluralistic environment.

Abstract: The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training
towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving
further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically
rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although
effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain
about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent
of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of
supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with
the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper
thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and
providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we
introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on
reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently
trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference
time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional
performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and
exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally,
we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently
exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced
datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3)
Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting
that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.

Conclusion: 多模态自适应融合能高效表示分子，且双模态融合的重要性通过可解释方法验证。

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern
drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a
significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning
scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the
theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a
prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular
representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to
dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two
modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level,
structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted
from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At
the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the
molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose
an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures
to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent
molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot
and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art
performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of
two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.

Result: 实验表明，MINGLE显著减少遗忘，性能比现有方法平均提升7-9%。

Conclusion: MINGLE通过动态适应和约束优化，为持续模型合并提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models
sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and
efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face
critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited
adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic
forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation
to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for
test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a
small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide
the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed
of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and
improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating
updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses
activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To
further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation
Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on
interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive
experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE
achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and
consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average
across diverse task orders.

Motivation: RoPE（旋转位置嵌入）虽然提高了模型性能，但使注意力计算复杂化，传统快速算法不再适用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多项式方法和快速傅里叶变换，设计了一种新的算法。

Result: 在有限输入条件下，实现了几乎线性时间的RoPE注意力计算。

Conclusion: 新算法成功克服了RoPE带来的计算复杂性，同时证明了有限输入条件是快速算法的必要条件。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has been widely applied to many machine learning
tasks. A main bottleneck in the time to perform transformer computations is a
task called attention computation. [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] have shown
that in the bounded entry regime, there is an almost linear time algorithm to
approximate the attention computation. They also proved that the bounded entry
assumption is necessary for a fast algorithm assuming the popular Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  A new version of transformer which uses position embeddings has recently been
very successful. At a high level, position embedding enables the model to
capture the correlations between tokens while taking into account their
position in the sequence. Perhaps the most popular and effective version is
Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which was proposed by [Su, Lu, Pan, Murtadha,
Wen, and Liu, Neurocomputing 2024].
  A main downside of RoPE is that it complicates the attention computation
problem, so that previous techniques for designing almost linear time
algorithms no longer seem to work. In this paper, we show how to overcome this
issue, and give a new algorithm to compute the RoPE attention in almost linear
time in the bounded entry regime. (Again, known lower bounds imply that bounded
entries are necessary.) Our new algorithm combines two techniques in a novel
way: the polynomial method, which was used in prior fast attention algorithms,
and the Fast Fourier Transform.

Conclusion: AdaCoT有效平衡了推理性能与计算成本，为LLMs的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it
indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to
substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler
inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive
Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to
invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem
that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT
invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision
boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to
determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical
contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision
boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable
adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully
navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage
for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production
traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and
decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance
on complex tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态扰动自适应方法，用于处理时间序列任务中的输入输出映射问题，通过主干-分支架构实现持续适应和跨任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时间序列任务中同一输入可能产生不同输出的挑战，探索模型在频繁任务切换下的适应能力。

Method: 采用主干-分支架构，主干缓慢演化以捕捉长期结构，分支模块为每个任务重新初始化和更新，支持无显式任务标签的持续适应。

Result: 理论证明该方法比静态模型和LoRA具有更高的表达能力，实验显示在复杂任务环境中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的动态方法在适应性和学习能力上表现优异，适用于频繁任务切换的场景。

Abstract: We formulate time series tasks as input-output mappings under varying
objectives, where the same input may yield different outputs. This challenges a
model's generalization and adaptability. To study this, we construct a
synthetic dataset with numerous conflicting subtasks to evaluate adaptation
under frequent task shifts. Existing static models consistently fail in such
settings. We propose a dynamic perturbed adaptive method based on a
trunk-branch architecture, where the trunk evolves slowly to capture long-term
structure, and branch modules are re-initialized and updated for each task.
This enables continual test-time adaptation and cross-task transfer without
relying on explicit task labels. Theoretically, we show that this architecture
has strictly higher functional expressivity than static models and LoRA. We
also establish exponential convergence of branch adaptation under the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex and conflicting task
environments, exhibiting fast adaptation and progressive learning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法需要预设聚类数k或依赖阈值，限制了其有效性。

Method: k*-means结合最小描述长度原则，通过分裂和合并聚类自动优化k*，同时优化标准k-means目标。

Result: 实验证明k*-means在未知k时显著优于现有方法，且能准确估计k，运行时间与数据集规模相适应。

Conclusion: k*-means是一种高效且无需参数设置的聚类算法，适用于未知聚类数的场景。

Abstract: Clustering is a widely used and powerful machine learning technique, but its
effectiveness is often limited by the need to specify the number of clusters,
k, or by relying on thresholds that implicitly determine k. We introduce
k*-means, a novel clustering algorithm that eliminates the need to set k or any
other parameters. Instead, it uses the minimum description length principle to
automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, k*, by splitting and
merging clusters while also optimising the standard k-means objective. We prove
that k*-means is guaranteed to converge and demonstrate experimentally that it
significantly outperforms existing methods in scenarios where k is unknown. We
also show that it is accurate in estimating k, and that empirically its runtime
is competitive with existing methods, and scales well with dataset size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理模拟（ABM）的高计算成本限制了其在大规模场景分析和实时决策中的应用，因此需要高效的替代模型来降低计算负担。

Abstract: Multi-agent simulations enables the modeling and analyses of the dynamic
behaviors and interactions of autonomous entities evolving in complex
environments. Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study emergent
phenomena arising from local interactions. However, their high computational
cost poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale simulations
requiring extensive parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty
quantification. The increasing complexity of ABM limits their feasibility for
real-time decision-making and large-scale scenario analysis. To address these
limitations, surrogate models offer an efficient alternative by learning
approximations from sparse simulation data. These models provide
cheap-to-evaluate predictions, significantly reducing computational costs while
maintaining accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, including regression
models, neural networks, random forests and Gaussian processes, have been
applied to construct robust surrogates. Moreover, uncertainty quantification
and sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in enhancing model reliability and
interpretability.
  This article explores the motivations, methods, and applications of surrogate
modeling for ABM, emphasizing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational
efficiency, and interpretability. Through a case study on a segregation model,
we highlight the challenges associated with building and validating surrogate
models, comparing different approaches and evaluating their performance.
Finally, we discuss future perspectives on integrating surrogate models within
ABM to improve scalability, explainability, and real-time decision support
across various fields such as ecology, urban planning and economics.

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer在无监督学习中的应用提供了理论和实践支持，表明其可作为通用工具。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
modern artificial intelligence, among which the capability of implicitly
learning an internal model during inference time is widely believed to play a
key role in the under standing of pre-trained large language models. However,
most recent works have been focusing on studying supervised learning topics
such as in-context learning, leaving the field of unsupervised learning largely
unexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of transformers in solving
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a fundamental unsupervised learning problem
through the lens of statistical estimation. We propose a transformer-based
learning framework called TGMM that simultaneously learns to solve multiple GMM
tasks using a shared transformer backbone. The learned models are empirically
demonstrated to effectively mitigate the limitations of classical methods such
as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or spectral algorithms, at the same time
exhibit reasonable robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove
that transformers can approximate both the EM algorithm and a core component of
spectral methods (cubic tensor power iterations). These results bridge the gap
between practical success and theoretical understanding, positioning
transformers as versatile tools for unsupervised learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive collection of industrial screw driving
datasets designed to advance research in manufacturing process monitoring and
quality control. The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over
34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled
experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving
processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates
specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use
(s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and
surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types
(s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower
workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the
standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware
specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical
data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving
processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of
machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access
pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built
Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading,
preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets
serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive
maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology
evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the
scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing,
this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical
approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.

Motivation: 随着基础架构的能力逐渐被理解，研究转向结合多种架构范式的模型，尤其是结合空间（图结构）和时间（时间演化）维度的时序GNNs。本文旨在通过逻辑工具分析其表达能力。

Method: 将时序GNNs与二维乘积逻辑（如命题时序逻辑PTL和模态逻辑K的乘积）联系起来，分析不同架构（如递归静态GNNs、graph-and-time TGNNs和global TGNNs）的表达能力。

Result: 递归静态GNNs可以表达PTL和K乘积逻辑的所有性质，而其他架构只能表达受限片段。

Conclusion: 首次为时序GNNs提供了逻辑表征，并确立了其相对表达能力的新结果。

Abstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures --
including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural
networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language
theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well
understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple
architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to
analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial
(graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper,
we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by
connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive
power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are
combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over
time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past)
propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast,
architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express
restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and
spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first
logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative
expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在静态数据生成中表现优异，但在持续学习场景中面临灾难性遗忘问题，需要系统性解决方案。

Method: 通过理论分析提出了三种一致性标准（IKC、UKC、LKC），并设计了一个名为CCD的框架，将这些标准融入训练中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CCD在持续学习设置下表现优异，特别是在跨任务知识重叠丰富的任务中。

Conclusion: CCD框架通过一致性标准有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data
generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios
faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired
generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically
address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG)
paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative
diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual
classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process.
In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing
cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis
reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks
are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge
consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label
knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual
Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these
consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms
$\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This
promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new
generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual
settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean
Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.

Method: 设计了针对饱和度和重要性的特定重加权策略，并通过实验分析其效果，最终提出结合两者的SatImp方法。

Result: 饱和度比重重要性更有效，两者结合能进一步提升效果；权重分布的平滑性和粒度对遗忘效果有重要影响。

Conclusion: SatImp方法有效结合了饱和度和重要性的优势，填补了研究空白，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with
large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left
unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the
understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we
identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and
Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data
should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are
most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design
specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective
effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on
well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as
follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based
reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii)
Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods,
whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of
unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the
weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple
reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and
importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of
our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating
directions for future research. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究Hessian主空间与梯度的对齐现象，以及平坦和尖锐方向在Hessian谱中的不同作用，旨在设计更高效的优化器。

Method: 通过Bulk-SGD的消融实验，分析其稳定性，并引入插值梯度方法统一SGD、Dom-SGD和Bulk-SGD。

Result: 平坦方向的更新可加速收敛但可能影响稳定性，插值方法能平衡这些效应。Hessian曲率能量主要集中于主空间。

Conclusion: 研究为设计基于曲率感知的优化器提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted a surprising alignment between gradients and the
top eigenspace of the Hessian -- termed the Dominant subspace -- during neural
network training. Concurrently, there has been growing interest in the distinct
roles of sharp and flat directions in the Hessian spectrum. In this work, we
study Bulk-SGD, a variant of SGD that restricts updates to the orthogonal
complement of the Dominant subspace. Through ablation studies, we characterize
the stability properties of Bulk-SGD and identify critical hyperparameters that
govern its behavior. We show that updates along the Bulk subspace,
corresponding to flatter directions in the loss landscape, can accelerate
convergence but may compromise stability. To balance these effects, we
introduce interpolated gradient methods that unify SGD, Dom-SGD, and Bulk-SGD.
Finally, we empirically connect this subspace decomposition to the Generalized
Gauss-Newton and Functional Hessian terms, showing that curvature energy is
largely concentrated in the Dominant subspace. Our findings suggest a
principled approach to designing curvature-aware optimizers.

Conclusion: FedHQ通过混合量化策略有效解决了FL的效率与准确性权衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized model training approach that
preserves data privacy but struggles with low efficiency. Quantization, a
powerful training optimization technique, has been widely explored for
integration into FL. However, many studies fail to consider the distinct
performance attribution between particular quantization strategies, such as
post-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT). As a
result, existing FL quantization methods rely solely on either PTQ or QAT,
optimizing for speed or accuracy while compromising the other. To efficiently
accelerate FL and maintain distributed convergence accuracy across various FL
settings, this paper proposes a hybrid quantitation approach combining PTQ and
QAT for FL systems. We conduct case studies to validate the effectiveness of
using hybrid quantization in FL. To solve the difficulty of modeling speed and
accuracy caused by device and data heterogeneity, we propose a hardware-related
analysis and data-distribution-related analysis to help identify the trade-off
boundaries for strategy selection. Based on these, we proposed a novel
framework named FedHQ to automatically adopt optimal hybrid strategy allocation
for FL systems. Specifically, FedHQ develops a coarse-grained global
initialization and fine-grained ML-based adjustment to ensure efficiency and
robustness. Experiments show that FedHQ achieves up to 2.47x times training
acceleration and up to 11.15% accuracy improvement and negligible extra
overhead.

Method: 开发了UCB-VV算法用于遗憾设置，SHVV算法用于固定预算设置，并扩展至次高斯分布。

Result: UCB-VV的遗憾上界为O(log n)，SHVV的错误概率上界为exp(-n/(log(K)H)，均达到理论最优。

Conclusion: UCB-VV和SHVV在理论和实验中均表现优异，适用于金融等领域。

Abstract: This paper focuses on selecting the arm with the highest variance from a set
of $K$ independent arms. Specifically, we focus on two settings: (i) regret
setting, that penalizes the number of pulls of suboptimal arms in terms of
variance, and (ii) fixed-budget \ac{BAI} setting, that evaluates the ability of
an algorithm to determine the arm with the highest variance after a fixed
number of pulls. We develop a novel online algorithm called \texttt{UCB-VV} for
the regret setting and show that its upper bound on regret for bounded rewards
evolves as $\mathcal{O}\left(\log{n}\right)$ where $n$ is the horizon. By
deriving the lower bound on the regret, we show that \texttt{UCB-VV} is order
optimal. For the fixed budget \ac{BAI} setting and propose the \texttt{SHVV}
algorithm. We show that the upper bound of the error probability of
\texttt{SHVV} evolves as $\exp\left(-\frac{n}{\log(K) H}\right)$, where $H$
represents the complexity of the problem, and this rate matches the
corresponding lower bound. We extend the framework from bounded distributions
to sub-Gaussian distributions using a novel concentration inequality on the
sample variance. Leveraging the same, we derive a concentration inequality for
the empirical Sharpe ratio (SR) for sub-Gaussian distributions, which was
previously unknown in the literature. Empirical simulations show that
\texttt{UCB-VV} consistently outperforms \texttt{$\epsilon$-greedy} across
different sub-optimality gaps though it is surpassed by \texttt{VTS}, which
exhibits the lowest regret, albeit lacking in theoretical guarantees. We also
illustrate the superior performance of \texttt{SHVV}, for a fixed budget
setting under 6 different setups against uniform sampling. Finally, we conduct
a case study to empirically evaluate the performance of the \texttt{UCB-VV} and
\texttt{SHVV} in call option trading on $100$ stocks generated using \ac{GBM}.

Result: PEARL在三种视觉架构和多种持续学习场景中均大幅优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PEARL通过动态秩分配有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，展示了其在持续学习中的优越性和通用性。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural
networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge
when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are
gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting
with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated
knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these
approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal
resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a
rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA
components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task
weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components
based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter
space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three
vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision
Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms
all considered baselines by a large margin.

Result: 证明了1-Lipschitz ResNets在宽度和深度增加时的稠密性，以及固定宽度时的逼近能力。

Conclusion: 本文首次为1-Lipschitz ResNets提供了通用逼近保证，为其实际应用奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: 1-Lipschitz neural networks are fundamental for generative modelling, inverse
problems, and robust classifiers. In this paper, we focus on 1-Lipschitz
residual networks (ResNets) based on explicit Euler steps of negative gradient
flows and study their approximation capabilities. Leveraging the Restricted
Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, we first show that these 1-Lipschitz ResNets are
dense in the set of scalar 1-Lipschitz functions on any compact domain when
width and depth are allowed to grow. We also show that these networks can
exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove
a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the
residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because
every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained
with off-the-shelf optimisers. This paper provides the first universal
approximation guarantees for 1-Lipschitz ResNets, laying a rigorous foundation
for their practical use.

Abstract: The neural operator (NO) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for solving

Transformer architecture, which offers NOs the capability to capture long-range
dependencies in PDE dynamics. However, existing Transformer-based NOs suffer
from quadratic complexity, lack geometric rigor, and thus suffer from
sub-optimal performance on regular grids. As a remedy, we propose the Geometric
Mamba Neural Operator (GeoMaNO) framework, which empowers NOs with Mamba's
modeling capability, linear complexity, plus geometric rigor. We evaluate
GeoMaNO's performance on multiple standard and popularly employed PDE
benchmarks, spanning from Darcy flow problems to Navier-Stokes problems.
GeoMaNO improves existing baselines in solution operator approximation by as
much as 58.9%.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, users rely on natural language instructions
to guide large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. These
instructions are often complex, diverse, and subject to frequent change.
However, LLMs do not always attend to these instructions reliably, and users
lack simple mechanisms to emphasize their importance beyond modifying prompt
wording or structure. To address this, we present an inference-time method that
enables users to emphasize specific parts of their prompt by steering the
model's attention toward them, aligning the model's perceived importance of
different prompt tokens with user intent. Unlike prior approaches that are
limited to static instructions, require significant offline profiling, or rely
on fixed biases, we dynamically update the proportion of model attention given
to the user-specified parts--ensuring improved instruction following without
performance degradation. We demonstrate that our approach improves instruction
following across a variety of tasks involving multiple instructions and
generalizes across models of varying scales.

Result: 在预训练和迁移学习任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REEF展示了作为图基础模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising
direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets
through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on
explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for
generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training
strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages
relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary
in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store
relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we
introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of
aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens.
In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific
projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node
representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same
relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset
pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more
effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive
experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both
pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a
powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) problems are fundamental in online
decision-making and have been instrumental in finding an optimal policy for
Markov decision processes (MDPs). Function approximations are usually deployed
to handle large or infinite state-action space. In our work, we consider the RL
problems with function approximation and we develop a new algorithm to solve it
efficiently. Our algorithm is based on the linear programming (LP)
reformulation and it resolves the LP at each iteration improved with new data
arrival. Such a resolving scheme enables our algorithm to achieve an
instance-dependent sample complexity guarantee, more precisely, when we have
$N$ data, the output of our algorithm enjoys an instance-dependent
$\tilde{O}(1/N)$ suboptimality gap. In comparison to the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$
worst-case guarantee established in the previous literature, our
instance-dependent guarantee is tighter when the underlying instance is
favorable, and the numerical experiments also reveal the efficient empirical
performances of our algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在微调服务中存在安全威胁，用户上传的数据可能导致模型输出不安全，现有防御方法难以平衡安全性和实用性。

Method: Safe Delta通过调整微调前后的参数变化（delta参数），估计安全退化，选择参数以最大化实用性并限制安全损失，最后应用安全补偿向量。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，Safe Delta能有效保持安全性，同时不影响良性数据集的实用性增益。

Conclusion: Safe Delta是一种有效的后训练防御方法，能够在保持模型实用性的同时解决微调服务中的安全问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI
assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific
applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users
to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services
introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign,
can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing
defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets
(e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice
versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware
post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the
parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta
estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility
while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to
mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse
datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety
while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管带偏置的注意力机制在许多领域中被广泛使用，但其计算效率问题尚未得到针对性优化，限制了其在复杂任务中的应用。

Method: 基于FlashAttention的计算效率理论，提出FlashBias方法，利用低秩压缩感知理论，实现对常见偏置的快速精确计算及一般形式偏置的快速近似计算。

Result: FlashBias在AlphaFold中实现了1.5倍的速度提升，在视觉与语言模型中实现了超过2倍的速度提升，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: FlashBias为带偏置的注意力机制提供了高效的解决方案，显著提升了其在实际任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Attention mechanism has emerged as a foundation module of modern deep
learning models and has also empowered many milestones in various domains.
Moreover, FlashAttention with IO-aware speedup resolves the efficiency issue of
standard attention, further promoting its practicality. Beyond canonical
attention, attention with bias also widely exists, such as relative position
bias in vision and language models and pair representation bias in AlphaFold.
In these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of
attention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven
essential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of
attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent,
which seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the
computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is
determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this
theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank
compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many
widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in
general formalization. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely
optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$
speedup for AlphaFold, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in
vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

Motivation: 港口泊位数据公开文档常不完整或不准确，需数据驱动方法改进。

Method: 利用AIS数据聚类和超参数优化进行无监督空间建模。

Result: 模型在多个港口测试中表现优异，平均Bhattacharyya距离为0.85，优于现有方法的13.56。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精确地定位泊位边界，提升港口运营监控和供应链优化。

Abstract: Port berthing sites are regions of high interest for monitoring and
optimizing port operations. Data sourced from the Automatic Identification
System (AIS) can be superimposed on berths enabling their real-time monitoring
and revealing long-term utilization patterns. Ultimately, insights from
multiple berths can uncover bottlenecks, and lead to the optimization of the
underlying supply chain of the port and beyond. However, publicly available
documentation of port berths, even when available, is frequently incomplete -
e.g. there may be missing berths or inaccuracies such as incorrect boundary
boxes - necessitating a more robust, data-driven approach to port berth
localization. In this context, we propose an unsupervised spatial modeling
method that leverages AIS data clustering and hyperparameter optimization to
identify berthing sites. Trained on one month of freely available AIS data and
evaluated across ports of varying sizes, our models significantly outperform
competing methods, achieving a mean Bhattacharyya distance of 0.85 when
comparing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) trained on separate data splits,
compared to 13.56 for the best existing method. Qualitative comparison with
satellite images and existing berth labels further supports the superiority of
our method, revealing more precise berth boundaries and improved spatial
resolution across diverse port environments.

Method: 通过识别简单实用的条件，证明偏好需用2维奖励函数表示，并推广到d维情况，分析其在MDP和CMDP中的性质。

Result: 在MDP中，多维奖励函数的最优策略保留了标量奖励的许多性质，但在CMDP中则不具备。

Conclusion: 论文为多维奖励函数的表示和应用提供了理论支持，并揭示了其在MDP和CMDP中的不同表现。

Abstract: Recent work has formalized the reward hypothesis through the lens of expected
utility theory, by interpreting reward as utility. Hausner's foundational work
showed that dropping the continuity axiom leads to a generalization of expected
utility theory where utilities are lexicographically ordered vectors of
arbitrary dimension. In this paper, we extend this result by identifying a
simple and practical condition under which preferences cannot be represented by
scalar rewards, necessitating a 2-dimensional reward function. We provide a
full characterization of such reward functions, as well as the general
d-dimensional case, in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under a memorylessness
assumption on preferences. Furthermore, we show that optimal policies in this
setting retain many desirable properties of their scalar-reward counterparts,
while in the Constrained MDP (CMDP) setting -- another common multiobjective
setting -- they do not.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了方程发现的准确性和效率，同时确保方程的物理合理性。

Abstract: Discovering symbolic differential equations from data uncovers fundamental
dynamical laws underlying complex systems. However, existing methods often
struggle with the vast search space of equations and may produce equations that
violate known physical laws. In this work, we address these problems by
introducing the concept of \textit{symmetry invariants} in equation discovery.
We leverage the fact that differential equations admitting a symmetry group can
be expressed in terms of differential invariants of symmetry transformations.
Thus, we propose to use these invariants as atomic entities in equation
discovery, ensuring the discovered equations satisfy the specified symmetry.
Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing equation discovery methods
such as sparse regression and genetic programming, improving their accuracy and
efficiency. We validate the proposed method through applications to various
physical systems, such as fluid and reaction-diffusion, demonstrating its
ability to recover parsimonious and interpretable equations that respect the
laws of physics.

Result: AP-Calculus在因果推断中优于其他结构（如Pearl的因果框架），并能扩展或取代传统的do-calculus。

Conclusion: AP-Calculus为分析特征标签归因、管理虚假相关性等提供了数学基础，适用于大型语言模型等预测模型。

Abstract: This paper introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus), a novel
mathematical framework for determining causal relationships in structured
Bayesian networks. We investigate a specific network architecture with source
nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each
input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. We prove that
for each label, exactly one intermediate node acts as a deconfounder while
others serve as confounders, enabling optimal attribution of features to their
corresponding labels. The framework formalizes the dual nature of intermediate
nodes as both confounders and deconfounders depending on the context, and
establishes separation functions that maximize distinctions between
intermediate representations. We demonstrate that the proposed network
architecture is optimal for causal inference compared to alternative
structures, including those based on Pearl's causal framework. AP-Calculus
provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing feature-label
attributions, managing spurious correlations, quantifying information gain,
ensuring fairness, and evaluating uncertainty in prediction models, including
large language models. Theoretical verification shows that AP-Calculus not only
extends but can also subsume traditional do-calculus for many practical
applications, offering a more direct approach to causal inference in supervised
learning contexts.

Method: 通过理论证明将IGB与MF理论联系起来，并扩展MF/IGB框架到多节点激活函数。

Result: 发现优化的初始化必然存在偏见，并提供了设计初始化方案的实用指南。

Conclusion: 初始化的偏见与快速准确学习条件相关，为架构设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at
initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the
intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field
(MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly
initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode.
Concurrently, untrained DNNs were found to exhibit an initial-guessing bias
(IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single
class. In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the
correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a
network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and
accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the
initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than
neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation
functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes
that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and
average-pooling layers.

Result: 在15个组合环境中，包括近1700万联合动作的环境，SAINT均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SAINT是一种高效且通用的策略架构，适用于复杂的组合动作空间。

Abstract: The combinatorial structure of many real-world action spaces leads to
exponential growth in the number of possible actions, limiting the
effectiveness of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent
approaches for combinatorial action spaces impose factorized or sequential
structures over sub-actions, failing to capture complex joint behavior. We
introduce the Sub-Action Interaction Network using Transformers (SAINT), a
novel policy architecture that represents multi-component actions as unordered
sets and models their dependencies via self-attention conditioned on the global
state. SAINT is permutation-invariant, sample-efficient, and compatible with
standard policy optimization algorithms. In 15 distinct combinatorial
environments across three task domains, including environments with nearly 17
million joint actions, SAINT consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: We propose new graph kernels grounded in the study of metric graphs via
tropical algebraic geometry. In contrast to conventional graph kernels that are
based on graph combinatorics such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs, our graph
kernels are purely based on the geometry and topology of the underlying metric
space. A key characterizing property of our construction is its invariance
under edge subdivision, making the kernels intrinsically well-suited for
comparing graphs that represent different underlying spaces. We develop
efficient algorithms for computing these kernels and analyze their complexity,
showing that it depends primarily on the genus of the input graphs.
Empirically, our kernels outperform existing methods in label-free settings, as
demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. We further
highlight their practical utility through an urban road network classification
task.

Conclusion: 多模态框架能有效利用互补信息，但GNNs可能学习到相似的表征而非独特的物理见解。

Abstract: Molecular graph neural networks (GNNs) often focus exclusively on XYZ-based
geometric representations and thus overlook valuable chemical context available
in public databases like PubChem. This work introduces a multimodal framework
that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas,
physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated
fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to
exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate
that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic
properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN
architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating
on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather
than distinctly different physical insights.

Conclusion: Transformer在解决不适定逆问题中具有潜力，并为理解其知识提取机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformers have shown a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL),
making predictions based on contextual examples. However, while theoretical
analyses have explored this prediction capability, the nature of the inferred
context and its utility for downstream predictions remain open questions. This
paper aims to address these questions by examining ICL for inverse linear
regression (ILR), where context inference can be characterized by unsupervised
learning of underlying weight vectors. Focusing on the challenging scenario of
rank-deficient inverse problems, where context length is smaller than the
number of unknowns in the weight vectors and regularization is necessary, we
introduce a linear transformer to learn the inverse mapping from contextual
examples to the underlying weight vector. Our findings reveal that the
transformer implicitly learns both a prior distribution and an effective
regularization strategy, outperforming traditional ridge regression and
regularization methods. A key insight is the necessity of low task
dimensionality relative to the context length for successful learning.
Furthermore, we numerically verify that the error of the transformer estimator
scales linearly with the noise level, the ratio of task dimension to context
length, and the condition number of the input data. These results not only
demonstrate the potential of transformers for solving ill-posed inverse
problems, but also provide a new perspective towards understanding the
knowledge extraction mechanism within transformers.

Conclusion: 不变分区是知识存储和学习的结构性基础，为表示学习提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central
challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable
without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions,
requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which
such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should
characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge
structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions,
essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that
interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge;
hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as
partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract
knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations,
forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs.
On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these
knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant
partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We
formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the
invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic
structure.

Abstract: The rapid increase in computing power and the ability to store Big Data in
the infrastructure has enabled predictions in a large variety of domains by
Machine Learning. However, in many cases, existing Machine Learning tools are
considered insufficient or incorrect since they exploit only probabilistic
dependencies rather than inference logic. Causal Machine Learning methods seem
to close this gap. In this paper, two prevalent tools based on Causal Machine
Learning methods are compared, as well as their mathematical underpinning
background. The operation of the tools is demonstrated by examining their
response to 18 queries, based on the IDEAL Household Energy Dataset, published
by the University of Edinburgh. First, it was important to evaluate the causal
relations assumption that allowed the use of this approach; this was based on
the preexisting scientific knowledge of the domain and was implemented by use
of the in-built validation tools. Results were encouraging and may easily be
extended to other domains.

Abstract: Natural gradient methods significantly accelerate the training of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), but are often prohibitively costly.
We introduce a suite of techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
energy natural gradient descent (ENGD) for PINNs. First, we leverage the
Woodbury formula to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of ENGD.
Second, we adapt the Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent
algorithm from the variational Monte Carlo literature to accelerate the
convergence. Third, we explore the use of randomized algorithms to further
reduce the computational cost in the case of large batch sizes. We find that
randomization accelerates progress in the early stages of training for
low-dimensional problems, and we identify key barriers to attaining
acceleration in other scenarios. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our
methods outperform previous approaches, achieving the same $L^2$ error as the
original ENGD up to $75\times$ faster.

Motivation: 理解RLLMs的失败模式和原因，以改进其推理能力。

Result: RLLMs普遍虚构未指定的边，错误率显著，部分模型尤为严重。

Conclusion: RLLMs在问题细节表征上存在广泛问题，需改进设计以减少此类错误。

Abstract: Large language models have recently made great strides in reasoning task
performance through chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies trained via reinforcement
learning; however, these "reasoning large language models" (RLLMs) remain
imperfect reasoners, and understanding the frequencies and causes of their
failure modes is important for both users and developers. We test o1-mini,
o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3
Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction
logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and
CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate edges not
specified in the prompt's description of the graph. This phenomenon persists
across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears
to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every
tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. Our results
indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of
problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this
weakness.

Conclusion: FABLE框架有效解决了天气预报模型对抗攻击的地域时空一致性问题，提升了攻击的实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based weather forecasting models have recently demonstrated
significant performance improvements over gold-standard physics-based
simulation tools. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
which raises concerns about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we first
investigate the feasibility of applying existing adversarial attack methods to
weather forecasting models. We argue that a successful attack should (1) not
modify significantly its original inputs, (2) be faithful, i.e., achieve the
desired forecast at targeted locations with minimal changes to non-targeted
locations, and (3) be geospatio-temporally realistic. However, balancing these
criteria is a challenge as existing methods are not designed to preserve the
geospatio-temporal dependencies of the original samples. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework called FABLE (Forecast Alteration By
Localized targeted advErsarial attack), which employs a 3D discrete wavelet
decomposition to extract the varying components of the geospatio-temporal data.
By regulating the magnitude of adversarial perturbations across different
components, FABLE can generate adversarial inputs that maintain
geospatio-temporal coherence while remaining faithful and closely aligned with
the original inputs. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over baseline methods across
various metrics.

*Jared Boyer,T. Konstantin Rusch,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的线性振荡状态空间模型（D-LinOSS），解决了原模型（LinOSS）在能量耗散机制上的局限性，并在长序列任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LinOSS模型在能量耗散机制上存在耦合问题，限制了其在长序列推理中的表现。本文旨在改进这一问题。

Method: 通过引入D-LinOSS模型，学习多时间尺度的能量耗散机制，并分析其频谱分布与稳定性。

Result: D-LinOSS在长序列任务中优于LinOSS，且减少了50%的超参数搜索空间。

Conclusion: D-LinOSS是一种更灵活且高效的振荡状态空间模型，适用于长序列学习任务。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a class of networks for sequence learning that
benefit from fixed state size and linear complexity with respect to sequence
length, contrasting the quadratic scaling of typical attention mechanisms.
Inspired from observations in neuroscience, Linear Oscillatory State-Space
models (LinOSS) are a recently proposed class of SSMs constructed from layers
of discretized forced harmonic oscillators. Although these models perform
competitively, leveraging fast parallel scans over diagonal recurrent matrices
and achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with sequence length up to
50k, LinOSS models rely on rigid energy dissipation ("forgetting") mechanisms
that are inherently coupled to the timescale of state evolution. As forgetting
is a crucial mechanism for long-range reasoning, we demonstrate the
representational limitations of these models and introduce Damped Linear
Oscillatory State-Space models (D-LinOSS), a more general class of oscillatory
SSMs that learn to dissipate latent state energy on multiple timescales. We
analyze the spectral distribution of the model's recurrent matrices and prove
that the SSM layers exhibit stable dynamics under simple, flexible
parameterizations. D-LinOSS consistently outperforms previous LinOSS methods on
long-range learning tasks, without introducing additional complexity, and
simultaneously reduces the hyperparameter search space by 50%.

<details>

Motivation: 现有防御方法未能解决LLMs对有害数据的固有可训练性，导致其在更强攻击下仍易受攻击。

Method: SEAM通过新型损失函数和对抗梯度上升技术，耦合良性及有害数据的优化轨迹，实现自毁效果。

Result: SEAM在低强度攻击下表现出最先进的鲁棒性，高强度攻击下则导致性能崩溃，使模型无法使用。

Conclusion: SEAM为LLMs提供了一种有效的防御机制，使其在对抗有害微调攻击时更具韧性。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attacks pose a major threat to the security of large
language models (LLMs), allowing adversaries to compromise safety guardrails
with minimal harmful data. While existing defenses attempt to reinforce LLM
alignment, they fail to address models' inherent "trainability" on harmful
data, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attacks with increased learning rates
or larger harmful datasets. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce
SEAM, a novel alignment-enhancing defense that transforms LLMs into
self-destructive models with intrinsic resilience to misalignment attempts.
Specifically, these models retain their capabilities for legitimate tasks while
exhibiting substantial performance degradation when fine-tuned on harmful data.
The protection is achieved through a novel loss function that couples the
optimization trajectories of benign and harmful data, enhanced with adversarial
gradient ascent to amplify the self-destructive effect. To enable practical
training, we develop an efficient Hessian-free gradient estimate with
theoretical error bounds. Extensive evaluation across LLMs and datasets
demonstrates that SEAM creates a no-win situation for adversaries: the
self-destructive models achieve state-of-the-art robustness against
low-intensity attacks and undergo catastrophic performance collapse under
high-intensity attacks, rendering them effectively unusable. (warning: this
paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）在资源受限地区早期检测困难，现有研究缺乏针对孟加拉语的语音数据集和鲁棒的机器学习方法。

Conclusion: BenSparX为孟加拉语PD检测提供了首个数据集和高效框架，推动了文化包容性医疗解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing global health challenge, with
Bangladesh experiencing a notable rise in PD-related mortality. Early detection
of PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where
voice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective
alternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other
major languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a
significant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare
solutions. Moreover, most prior studies employed only a narrow set of acoustic
features, with limited or no hyperparameter tuning and feature selection
strategies, and little attention to model explainability. This restricts the
development of a robust and generalizable machine learning model. To address
this gap, we present BenSparX, the first Bengali conversational speech dataset
for PD detection, along with a robust and explainable machine learning
framework tailored for early diagnosis. The proposed framework incorporates
diverse acoustic feature categories, systematic feature selection methods, and
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with extensive hyperparameter
optimization. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability and trust in model
predictions, the framework incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
analysis to quantify the contribution of individual acoustic features toward PD
detection. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an
accuracy of 95.77%, F1 score of 95.57%, and AUC-ROC of 0.982. We further
externally validated our approach by applying the framework to existing PD
datasets in other languages, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, the dataset has
been made publicly available at https://github.com/Riad071/BenSParX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR-RL在训练和测试环境差异问题中表现出色，但现有研究多集中于SA-rectangular模型，而S-rectangular模型在实际应用中更准确地捕捉分布差异并生成更有效的鲁棒随机策略。

Method: 采用经验值迭代算法，针对基于散度的S-rectangular DR-RL模型，分析其样本复杂度。

Result: 建立了样本复杂度界限$\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$，首次在S-rectangular模型中实现了对$|\mathcal{S}|$、$|\mathcal{A}|$和$\varepsilon$的最优依赖。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和数值实验验证了算法的快速学习性能，为S-rectangular DR-RL的实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained
significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies
between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism,
and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with
SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical
analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity
and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more
accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications
and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we
study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based
S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of
$\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$,
where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$
denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the
discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample
complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve
optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$
simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through
numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical
worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed
algorithm.

Conclusion: 通过新机制，RL智能体能够表现出更自然的风险评估与规避行为，缩小了与生物代理的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural
question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which
have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this
question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in
a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a
striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of
self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency
gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which
exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging
this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms
that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our
approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic
environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns
that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，OOD动作的过度乐观估计问题限制了性能提升，现有方法可能引入过多约束或偏差。

Method: 利用动态模型想象OOD动作值，并用最大行为值进行裁剪，保持合理评估同时避免过度乐观。

Result: 理论证明ILQ收敛，且OOD动作的估计误差与分布内动作相当；实验在D4RL基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: ILQ方法有效平衡了OOD动作的评估，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning seeks to derive improved policies entirely
from historical data but often struggles with over-optimistic value estimates
for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This issue is typically mitigated via
policy constraint or conservative value regularization methods. However, these
approaches may impose overly constraints or biased value estimates, potentially
limiting performance improvements. To balance exploitation and restriction, we
propose an Imagination-Limited Q-learning (ILQ) method, which aims to maintain
the optimism that OOD actions deserve within appropriate limits. Specifically,
we utilize the dynamics model to imagine OOD action-values, and then clip the
imagined values with the maximum behavior values. Such design maintains
reasonable evaluation of OOD actions to the furthest extent, while avoiding its
over-optimism. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the proposed ILQ
under tabular Markov decision processes. Particularly, we demonstrate that the
error bound between estimated values and optimality values of OOD state-actions
possesses the same magnitude as that of in-distribution ones, thereby
indicating that the bias in value estimates is effectively mitigated.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range
of tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Result: 机器学习模型在预测自杀风险方面表现出合理准确性，但存在研究空白，如忽视假阳性和假阴性指标。

Conclusion: 机器学习识别了多种自杀风险因素，但需更全面的预防策略和进一步研究。

Abstract: Suicide remains one of the main preventable causes of death among active
service members and veterans. Early detection and prediction are crucial in
suicide prevention. Machine learning techniques have yielded promising results
in this area recently. This study aims to assess and summarize current research
and provides a comprehensive review regarding the application of machine
learning techniques in assessing and predicting suicidal ideation, attempts,
and mortality among members of military and veteran populations.
  A keyword search using PubMed, IEEE, ACM, and Google Scholar was conducted,
and the PRISMA protocol was adopted for relevant study selection. Thirty-two
articles met the inclusion criteria. These studies consistently identified risk
factors relevant to mental health issues such as depression, post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, prior attempts, physical health
problems, and demographic characteristics.
  Machine learning models applied in this area have demonstrated reasonable
predictive accuracy. However, additional research gaps still exist. First, many
studies have overlooked metrics that distinguish between false positives and
negatives, such as positive predictive value and negative predictive value,
which are crucial in the context of suicide prevention policies. Second, more
dedicated approaches to handling survival and longitudinal data should be
explored. Lastly, most studies focused on machine learning methods, with
limited discussion of their connection to clinical rationales.
  In summary, machine learning analyses have identified a wide range of risk
factors associated with suicide in military populations. The diversity and
complexity of these factors also demonstrates that effective prevention
strategies must be comprehensive and flexible.

Motivation: 当前奖励模型计算成本高且参数多，限制了实际应用，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出ELHSR模型，利用LLM隐藏状态信息，参数极少，训练样本需求少。

Result: ELHSR性能显著优于基线模型，计算效率提升多个数量级，且在仅使用logits时表现稳健。

Conclusion: ELHSR是一种高效且通用的奖励模型，可单独使用或与传统模型结合，提升性能。

Abstract: High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential
of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating
significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically
operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and
parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the
Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly
parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in
LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform
baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only
a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency
improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than
baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when
trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs.
In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to
achieve additional performance gains.

Result: 理论和实验验证了ACU在遗忘效果、模型保真度和系统效率上的优越性。

Conclusion: ACU为持续遗忘提供了一种高效、精确且隐私保护的解决方案，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence demands that models incrementally
update knowledge by Continual Learning (CL) to adapt to open-world
environments. To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning
(CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular
knowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods
primarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant
limitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to
the retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent
constraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these
methods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model
fidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by
adversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify
that the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from
their reliance on gradient-based updates. To bridge the research gap at its
root, we propose a novel gradient-free method for CU, named Analytic Continual
Unlearning (ACU), for efficient and exact forgetting with historical data
privacy preservation. In response to each unlearning request, our ACU
recursively derives an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution in an
interpretable manner using the least squares method. Theoretical and
experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our ACU on unlearning
effectiveness, model fidelity, and system efficiency.

Conclusion: AFCL通过梯度无关方法有效解决了联邦持续学习中的时空异质性问题，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to
collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic
real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both
spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data
heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly
degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic
forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the
root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of
gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a
gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by
deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted
features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a
lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation,
the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with
single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves
spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that,
regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients
and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and
identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the
consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across
various benchmark datasets and settings.

Conclusion: SchoenbAt作为点积核注意力的替代方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，优于其他高效注意力方法。

Abstract: Kernelized attention extends the attention mechanism by modeling sequence
correlations through kernel functions, making significant progresses in
optimizing attention. Under the guarantee of harmonic analysis theory, kernel
functions can be expanded with basis functions, inspiring random feature-based
approaches to enhance the efficiency of kernelized attention while maintaining
predictive performance. However, current random feature-based works are limited
to the Fourier basis expansions under Bochner's theorem. We propose
Schoenberg's theorem-based attention (SchoenbAt), which approximates
dot-product kernelized attention with the polynomial basis under Schoenberg's
theorem via random Maclaurin features and applies a two-stage regularization to
constrain the input space and restore the output scale, acting as a drop-in
replacement of dot-product kernelized attention. Our theoretical proof of the
unbiasedness and concentration error bound of SchoenbAt supports its efficiency
and accuracy as a kernelized attention approximation, which is also empirically
validated under various random feature dimensions. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate that SchoenbAt significantly enhances computational speed
while preserving competitive performance in terms of precision, outperforming
several efficient attention methods.

Result: 实验表明C-ABL在训练稳定性、收敛速度和准确性上优于传统ABL。

Conclusion: C-ABL通过结构化知识库有效解决了ABL的训练挑战。

Abstract: Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning
in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs,
which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back
for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training
process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is
large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While
prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they
typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we
propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly
leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL
training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of
sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction
space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a
stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL
outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training
stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex
knowledge setting.

*Zhen Zhao,Wenqi Huang,Zicheng Wang,Jiaxuan Hou,Peng Li,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SenseFlow提出了一种新型物理信息与自集成迭代框架，用于高精度电力潮流估计，解决了现有方法未充分考虑的电力系统特性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力潮流估计对电力系统的稳定性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究未能充分解决网络稀疏性和Slack节点的独特重要性等问题。

Method: SenseFlow结合了物理信息电力潮流网络（FlowNet）和自集成迭代估计（SeIter），通过迭代过程逐步预测高精度电压幅值和相位角。FlowNet采用虚拟节点注意力和Slack门控前馈模块，SeIter则通过参数指数移动平均创建鲁棒集成模型。

Result: 实验表明，SenseFlow在多种电网配置下均优于现有方法，实现了高精度电力潮流估计。

Conclusion: SenseFlow为电力潮流估计提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂电网环境。

Abstract: Power flow estimation plays a vital role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of electrical power systems, particularly in the context of growing
network complexities and renewable energy integration. However, existing
studies often fail to adequately address the unique characteristics of power
systems, such as the sparsity of network connections and the critical
importance of the unique Slack node, which poses significant challenges in
achieving high-accuracy estimations. In this paper, we present SenseFlow, a
novel physics-informed and self-ensembling iterative framework that integrates
two main designs, the Physics-Informed Power Flow Network (FlowNet) and
Self-Ensembling Iterative Estimation (SeIter), to carefully address the unique
properties of the power system and thereby enhance the power flow estimation.
Specifically, SenseFlow enforces the FlowNet to gradually predict
high-precision voltage magnitudes and phase angles through the iterative SeIter
process. On the one hand, FlowNet employs the Virtual Node Attention and
Slack-Gated Feed-Forward modules to facilitate efficient global-local
communication in the face of network sparsity and amplify the influence of the
Slack node on angle predictions, respectively. On the other hand, SeIter
maintains an exponential moving average of FlowNet's parameters to create a
robust ensemble model that refines power state predictions throughout the
iterative fitting process. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseFlow
outperforms existing methods, providing a promising solution for high-accuracy
power flow estimation across diverse grid configurations.

*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-TaLoRA是一种高效参数微调方法，用于解决联邦类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘和非独立同分布数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设静态数据分布，无法应对现实中新类不断出现的场景，且存在灾难性遗忘和性能下降问题。

Method: 通过任务无关的低秩残差适应（Fed-TaLoRA），仅微调共享的任务无关LoRA参数，结合残差权重更新机制和模型校准。

Result: 在多种数据异构场景下，Fed-TaLoRA显著优于现有方法，同时大幅降低资源需求。

Conclusion: Fed-TaLoRA为资源受限的联邦类增量学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) reduces communication and
computation costs in federated fine-tuning of pre-trained models by updating
only a small subset of model parameters. However, existing approaches assume
static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios
where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class
Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic
forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients.
Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or
suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose
Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel
parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL
scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters
across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while
enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical
analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism
that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our
methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies:
task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic
placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource
requirements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督方法，通过条件流匹配实现跨模态模型对齐，在数据稀缺时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态模型复用因内部表示对齐困难而受限，现有方法需大量配对数据或局限于特定领域。

Method: 采用条件流匹配学习不同模态潜在空间之间的条件流，包括解决最优传输问题和使用标记示例进行高效对齐。

Result: 在MNIST、ImageNet等数据集上，下游任务性能与端到端训练模型相当，尤其在标记数据稀缺时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态模型对齐提供了数据高效的解决方案，仅需少量监督。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across modalities
such as language and vision. However, model reuse across distinct modalities
(e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning
internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training
data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised
approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional
flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or
biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings:
($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an
inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using
labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity,
our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of
end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks
across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when
labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a
data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal
supervision.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理大规模和动态演变的图，计算和内存成本高，需要重新学习结构。

Method: 结合聚类和粗化技术，限制边形成于结构相关的节点子集，支持48种灵活配置。

Result: 在26个数据集和多种图神经网络架构上验证，GraphFLEx实现了最先进的性能和显著的可扩展性。

Conclusion: GraphFLEx为大规模动态图的结构学习提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph structure learning is a core problem in graph-based machine learning,
essential for uncovering latent relationships and ensuring model
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are ill-suited for
large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs, as they often require complete
re-learning of the structure upon the arrival of new nodes and incur
substantial computational and memory costs. In this work, we propose GraphFLEx:
a unified and scalable framework for Graph Structure Learning in Large and
Expanding Graphs. GraphFLEx mitigates the scalability bottlenecks by
restricting edge formation to structurally relevant subsets of nodes identified
through a combination of clustering and coarsening techniques. This
dramatically reduces the search space and enables efficient, incremental graph
updates. The framework supports 48 flexible configurations by integrating
diverse choices of learning paradigms, coarsening strategies, and clustering
methods, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph settings and learning
objectives. Extensive experiments across 26 diverse datasets and Graph Neural
Network architectures demonstrate that GraphFLEx achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly improved scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如最大团转换和搜索算法）在处理大规模MCES问题时存在可扩展性问题，NGA旨在克服这些限制。

Method: NGA通过堆叠神经组件模拟经典渐进分配（GA）过程，并引入可学习温度的高维参数化。

Result: 实验表明，NGA在MCES计算、图相似性估计和图检索任务中显著提升了性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: NGA为MCES计算提供了重要进展，并为其他分配问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem is a crucial challenge with
significant implications in domains such as biology and chemistry. Traditional
approaches, which include transformations into max-clique and search-based
algorithms, suffer from scalability issues when dealing with larger instances.
This paper introduces ``Neural Graduated Assignment'' (NGA), a simple,
scalable, unsupervised-training-based method that addresses these limitations
by drawing inspiration from the classical Graduated Assignment (GA) technique.
Central to NGA is stacking of neural components that closely resemble the GA
process, but with the reparameterization of learnable temperature into higher
dimension. We further theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of NGA,
showing its design leads to fast convergence, better exploration-exploitation
tradeoff, and ability to escape local optima. Extensive experiments across MCES
computation, graph similarity estimation, and graph retrieval tasks reveal that
NGA not only significantly improves computation time and scalability on large
instances but also enhances performance compared to existing methodologies. The
introduction of NGA marks a significant advancement in the computation of MCES
and offers insights into other assignment problems.

Motivation: 现有免训练方法在减少幻觉时性能不稳定且对超参数敏感，限制了实用性。

Method: 通过聚合先前层的表示构建动态语义参考，并纠正语义偏离的层以实现层间一致性。

Result: 在MME和POPE等基准测试中，DCLA显著减少幻觉并提升模型可靠性。

Conclusion: DCLA是一种高效且无需外部知识的幻觉缓解方法，适用于多种LVLM。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
they remain susceptible to hallucinations-generating content that is
inconsistent with the input image. Existing training-free hallucination
mitigation methods often suffer from unstable performance and high sensitivity
to hyperparameter settings, limiting their practicality and broader adoption.
In this paper, we propose a novel decoding mechanism, Decoding with Inter-layer
Consistency via Layer Aggregation (DCLA), which requires no retraining,
fine-tuning, or access to external knowledge bases. Specifically, our approach
constructs a dynamic semantic reference by aggregating representations from
previous layers, and corrects semantically deviated layers to enforce
inter-layer consistency. The method allows DCLA to robustly mitigate
hallucinations across multiple LVLMs. Experiments on hallucination benchmarks
such as MME and POPE demonstrate that DCLA effectively reduces hallucinations
while enhancing the reliability and performance of LVLMs.

approach integrates a standard RL policy with a theoretically-backed
alternative policy, inheriting formal stability guarantees while often
achieving better performance than either policy individually. We prove that our
combined policy converges to a specified goal set with known probability and
provide precise bounds on maximum deviation and convergence time. Empirical
validation on control tasks demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining
stability guarantees.

Result: 提出的方法在非线性映射中提供近似保证，降低计算复杂度并支持模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过理论和实验验证，本文方法为非线性模型的重要数据点识别提供了有效工具。

Abstract: While norm-based and leverage-score-based methods have been extensively
studied for identifying "important" data points in linear models, analogous
tools for nonlinear models remain significantly underdeveloped. By introducing
the concept of the adjoint operator of a nonlinear map, we address this gap and
generalize norm-based and leverage-score-based importance sampling to nonlinear
settings. We demonstrate that sampling based on these generalized notions of
norm and leverage scores provides approximation guarantees for the underlying
nonlinear mapping, similar to linear subspace embeddings. As direct
applications, these nonlinear scores not only reduce the computational
complexity of training nonlinear models by enabling efficient sampling over
large datasets but also offer a novel mechanism for model explainability and
outlier detection. Our contributions are supported by both theoretical analyses
and experimental results across a variety of supervised learning scenarios.

Result: 分析表明，该包装器继承了备用策略的目标达成保证，同时保持或提升基础策略的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外系统知识或在线约束优化，易于部署于多种强化学习架构和任务。

Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents
that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard
reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous
safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing
base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy
with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this
switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the
base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves
that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while
preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it
operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained
optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement
learning architectures and tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CDR设计方法未联合优化结合能，且依赖计算昂贵的在线强化学习，AbFlowNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AbFlowNet将扩散步骤视为GFlowNet状态，直接整合能量信号，统一扩散与奖励优化。

Result: 实验显示，AbFlowNet在氨基酸恢复、几何重建和结合能改进上均优于基线扩散模型。

Conclusion: AbFlowNet无需伪标签或在线强化学习，显著降低了能量误差，为抗体设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an
antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational
methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly
optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather,
binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy
estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework
that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step
as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard
diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals
into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization
in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the
base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric
reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. ABFlowNet
also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1%
without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive
online RL regimes.

Motivation: 现有令牌剪枝方法通常仅关注单一阶段的注意力机制，忽略了全局信息流，导致高剪枝率下性能显著下降。

Method: STAR采用两阶段剪枝策略：早期基于视觉自注意力剪除冗余低级特征，后期基于跨模态注意力去除任务无关令牌。

Result: 实验表明，STAR在多种LVLM架构和基准测试中实现了显著加速，同时保持甚至提升性能。

Conclusion: STAR通过全局视角的令牌剪枝，有效平衡计算效率与模型性能。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) leverage rich visual token
representations to achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, these tokens
also introduce significant computational overhead during inference. Existing
training-free token pruning methods typically adopt a single-stage strategy,
focusing either on visual self-attention or visual-textual cross-attention.
However, such localized perspectives often overlook the broader information
flow across the model, leading to substantial performance degradation,
especially under high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose STAR (Stage-wise
Attention-guided token Reduction), a training-free, plug-and-play framework
that approaches token pruning from a global perspective. Instead of pruning at
a single point, STAR performs attention-guided reduction in two complementary
stages: an early-stage pruning based on visual self-attention to remove
redundant low-level features, and a later-stage pruning guided by cross-modal
attention to discard task-irrelevant tokens. This holistic approach allows STAR
to significantly reduce computational cost while better preserving
task-critical information. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLM
architectures and benchmarks show that STAR achieves strong acceleration while
maintaining comparable, and in some cases even improved performance.

Result: DisCO在数学推理任务中显著优于GRPO及其变体，平均提升7%和6%。

Conclusion: DisCO通过消除难度偏差和增强稳定性，为大型推理模型的强化学习提供了更优方案。

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread
attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement
learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the
GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation
of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO
and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by
these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization
(DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of
discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its
recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a
discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons
clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used
as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained
optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable
training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its
variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting
discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO
and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a
constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of
advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a
significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated
answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly
outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average
gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B
model.

Result: 在Spider和BIRD基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有奖励模型。

Conclusion: Graph-Reward-SQL框架通过优化奖励模型和引入中间监督，提升了Text-to-SQL任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However,
existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry
reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by
repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory
overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of
RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel Text-to-SQL RL fine-tuning
framework named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward
model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals
while significantly reducing inference time and GPU memory usage. Building on
this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that
provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE)
subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and structural clarity
of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks,
including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing reward models.

Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large
language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent
need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the
learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an
entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially
governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and
discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter
symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance
phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These
phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural
representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic
Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory
observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning
optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of
entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent
phenomena in deep learning.

Conclusion: PINN方法为扭转分析提供了一种高效、准确的替代方案，可根据具体需求选择不同的求解器。

Abstract: The Saint-Venant torsion theory is a classical theory for analyzing the
torsional behavior of structural components, and it remains critically
important in modern computational design workflows. Conventional numerical
methods, including the finite element method (FEM), typically rely on
mesh-based approaches to obtain approximate solutions. However, these methods
often require complex and computationally intensive techniques to overcome the
limitations of approximation, leading to significant increases in computational
cost. The objective of this study is to develop a series of novel numerical
methods based on physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving the
Saint-Venant torsion equations. Utilizing the expressive power and the
automatic differentiation capability of neural networks, the PINN can solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) along with boundary conditions without
the need for intricate computational techniques. First, a PINN solver was
developed to compute the torsional constant for bars with arbitrary
cross-sectional geometries. This was followed by the development of a solver
capable of handling cases with sharp geometric transitions; variable-scaling
PINN (VS-PINN). Finally, a parametric PINN was constructed to address the
limitations of conventional single-instance PINN. The results from all three
solvers showed good agreement with reference solutions, demonstrating their
accuracy and robustness. Each solver can be selectively utilized depending on
the specific requirements of torsional behavior analysis.

Abstract: Image Generation models are a trending topic nowadays, with many people
utilizing Artificial Intelligence models in order to generate images. There are
many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which
depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent
Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative
Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can
generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may
violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing
the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case
of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the
model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted.
Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms
are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to
remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the
gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss
function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the
final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model,
removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such
that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The
weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank
Adaptation.We perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the
Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50
seconds using 4-5 images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双曲几何的残差量化方法（HRQ），用于更有效地表示层次数据，相比传统欧几里得方法（RQ），在层次建模和发现任务中性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层次数据广泛存在于多个领域，但传统的残差量化方法（RQ）依赖欧几里得几何，可能导致与层次分支结构的不匹配。因此，需要一种更自然的方法来捕捉层次关系。

Method: 提出Hyperbolic Residual Quantization（HRQ），通过双曲几何的嵌入网络、残差计算和距离度量，实现对层次数据的更自然表示。

Result: 在WordNet超名词树监督层次建模和层次发现任务中，HRQ性能优于传统RQ，最高提升20%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何的引入显著提升了离散表示学习对潜在层次结构的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical data arise in countless domains, from biological taxonomies and
organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual
Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken
representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a
multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce
fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching,
necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we
propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a
hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic
operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual
computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an
inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that
HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete
hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ
on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where
the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy
discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not
directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both
scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks
compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling
task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into
discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture
latent hierarchies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at analyzing graph-structured data but
struggle on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to
different classes. While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized
GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this
context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN
embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need
to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring
framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with
theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden
applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a
homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through
extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and
reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN
performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and
show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for
heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while
remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.

Result: 证明KKT点嵌入原理在神经元分裂中成立，并展示训练过程中映射关系的动态保持。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了网络宽度、参数冗余及不同规模同质网络解的结构联系。

Abstract: Understanding the convergence points and optimization landscape of neural
networks is crucial, particularly for homogeneous networks where
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the associated maximum-margin problem often
characterize solutions. This paper investigates the relationship between such
KKT points across networks of different widths generated via neuron splitting.
We introduce and formalize the \textbf{KKT point embedding principle},
establishing that KKT points of a homogeneous network's max-margin problem
($P_{\Phi}$) can be embedded into the KKT points of a larger network's problem
($P_{\tilde{\Phi}}$) via specific linear isometric transformations
corresponding to neuron splitting. We rigorously prove this principle holds for
neuron splitting in both two-layer and deep homogeneous networks. Furthermore,
we connect this static embedding to the dynamics of gradient flow training with
smooth losses. We demonstrate that trajectories initiated from appropriately
mapped points remain mapped throughout training and that the resulting
$\omega$-limit sets of directions are correspondingly mapped ($T(L(\theta(0)))
= L(\boldsymbol{\eta}(0))$), thereby preserving the alignment with KKT
directions dynamically when directional convergence occurs. Our findings offer
insights into the effects of network width, parameter redundancy, and the
structural connections between solutions found via optimization in homogeneous
networks of varying sizes.

Result: 新方法不仅消除了误导性结果，还降低了复杂度并保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在解决变分问题时具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Recently, innovative adaptations of the Ritz Method incorporating deep
learning have been developed, known as the Deep Ritz Method. This approach
employs a neural network as the test function for variational problems.
However, the neural network does not inherently satisfy the boundary conditions
of the variational problem. To resolve this issue, the Deep Ritz Method
introduces a penalty term into the functional of the variational problem, which
can lead to misleading results during the optimization process. In this work,
an ansatz is proposed that inherently satisfies the boundary conditions of the
variational problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed ansatz not only
eliminates misleading outcomes but also reduces complexity while maintaining
accuracy, showcasing its practical effectiveness in addressing variational
problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the specific challenges of
adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In
this work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw
inspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy
to difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end,
we construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according
to the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle
multimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages
careful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and
clearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus
reward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint,
alongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and
medium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a
greater impact on training. Our experiments with the Qwen2.5-VL-3B and
Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on 20k samples from the NeuraLadder dataset show that
Observe-R1 outperforms a series of larger reasoning models on both reasoning
and general benchmarks, achieving superior clarity and conciseness in reasoning
chains. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our strategies,
highlighting the robustness and generalization of our approach. The dataset and
code will be released at https://github.com/zrguo/Observe-R1.

Conclusion: SGDPO通过理论分析和实验验证，有效解决了DPO的局限性，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is broadly utilized for aligning Large
Language Models (LLMs) with human values because of its flexibility. Despite
its effectiveness, it has been observed that the capability of DPO to generate
human-preferred response is limited and the results of DPO are far from
resilient. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel
Self-Guided Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, i.e., SGDPO, which
incorporates a pilot term to steer the gradient flow during the optimization
process, allowing for fine-grained control over the updates of chosen and
rejected rewards. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed
method and elucidate its operational mechanism. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on various models and benchmarks. The extensive
experimental results demonstrate the consistency between the empirical results
and our theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed
approach (up to 9.19% higher score).

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto model for
learning from structured data, their decisional process remains opaque to the
end user, undermining their deployment in safety-critical applications. In the
case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that
explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a
chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess
the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to
synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts.
In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI
benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both
15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000
additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our
benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.

Motivation: LoRA及其变体在微调大语言模型时存在性能不足和内存开销问题，尤其是梯度近似和动量整合的挑战。

Method: 提出AltLoRA，采用交替投影方法避免联合更新设计中的梯度近似问题，并整合动量而不增加内存复杂度。

Result: 理论分析证明AltLoRA具有收敛性，实验表明其在多任务中优于LoRA及其变体，接近全微调性能。

Conclusion: AltLoRA在性能和内存效率上取得平衡，缩小了与全微调的差距。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective technique for reducing
memory overhead in fine-tuning large language models. However, it often suffers
from sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is
constrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to
mitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to
approximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and
different solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation
studies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design,
approaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a
higher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in
integrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost.
In this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids
the difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design,
meanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our
theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that
AltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation
invariance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that
AltLoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants, narrowing the gap toward full
fine-tuning while preserving superior memory efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多采样方法计算成本高，而LLMs在潜在理解区域（ZPD）内学习效果最佳，因此需要高效的数据选择方法。

Method: 提出UFO-RL框架，利用单次不确定性估计快速评估数据，并选择ZPD内的数据用于训练。

Result: 仅使用10%的数据即可达到或超越全数据训练效果，训练时间减少16倍，同时提升稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UFO-RL为LLMs的RL微调提供了一种高效实用的策略，专注于有价值的数据学习。

Abstract: Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to
multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data
selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory,
we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension
zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive
multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel
framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation
to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data
evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated
ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected
by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training,
reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and
generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for
scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.

TL;DR: 论文提出用k-means离散化替代传统的分位数分箱策略，以提升梯度提升决策树（GBDT）的预测性能，尤其在回归任务和低分箱预算场景中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分位数分箱策略可能忽略关键边界值，影响预测性能，而k-means离散化能更好地捕捉这些值。

Method: 使用k-means离散化初始化分箱，并在33个OpenML任务和合成数据集上进行测试，控制模态、偏斜和分箱预算。

Result: 在回归任务中，k-means无显著损失且在部分案例中表现显著（如MSE下降55%）；分类任务中两者表现相当；合成实验中k-means的MSE提升显著（20%-90%）。

Conclusion: 建议将k-means作为默认分箱方法，尤其在回归任务和低分箱预算场景中，因其性能优势且仅需一次性计算开销。

Abstract: Modern gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) accelerate split finding with
histogram-based binning, which reduces complexity from O(N) to O(B) given a
fixed bin budget B. However, the predominant quantile binning strategy-designed
to distribute data points evenly among bins-may overlook critical boundary
values that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we propose
replacing quantile binning with a k-means discretizer initialized with quantile
bins. We test this swap on 33 OpenML tasks plus synthetics that control for
modality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no
statistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in four cases-most
strikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though
k-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15
classification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs
0.68) with gaps $\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large
MSE gains-typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or
bin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exact splitting
when extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that
quantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means
flag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the
32-64-bin GPU regime-because it is a "safe default" with large upside, yet adds
only a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\approx$ 2s to bin 10M rows on one core).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is
crucial for long-term decision making under potential environment mismatches,
yet its finite-sample complexity study remains largely unexplored. Existing
works offer algorithms with asymptotic guarantees, but the absence of
finite-sample analysis hinders its principled understanding and practical
deployment, especially in data-limited settings. We close this gap by proposing
Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI), the first algorithm with provable finite-sample
complexity guarantee. Under standard uncertainty sets -- including
contamination sets and $\ell_p$-norm balls -- RHI attains an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy with near-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote
the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias
span. This result gives the first polynomial sample complexity guarantee for
robust average-reward RL. Moreover, our RHI's independence from prior knowledge
distinguishes it from many previous average-reward RL studies. Our work thus
constitutes a significant advancement in enhancing the practical applicability
of robust average-reward methods to complex, real-world problems.

Abstract: The latency of the exchanges in Market Making (MM) is inevitable due to
hardware limitations, system processing times, delays in receiving data from
exchanges, the time required for order transmission to reach the market, etc.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods for Market Making (MM) overlook
the impact of these latency, which can lead to unintended order cancellations
due to price discrepancies between decision and execution times and result in
undesired inventory accumulation, exposing MM traders to increased market risk.
Therefore, these methods cannot be applied in real MM scenarios. To address
these issues, we first build a realistic MM environment with random delays of
30-100 milliseconds for order placement and market information reception, and
implement a batch matching mechanism that collects orders within every 500
milliseconds before matching them all at once, simulating the batch auction
mechanisms adopted by some exchanges. Then, we propose Relaver, an RL-based
method for MM to tackle the latency and inventory risk issues. The three main
contributions of Relaver are: i) we introduce an augmented state-action space
that incorporates order hold time alongside price and volume, enabling Relaver
to optimize execution strategies under latency constraints and time-priority
matching mechanisms, ii) we leverage dynamic programming (DP) to guide the
exploration of RL training for better policies, iii) we train a market trend
predictor, which can guide the agent to intelligently adjust the inventory to
reduce the risk. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Relaver} significantly improves the
performance of state-of-the-art RL-based MM strategies across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in
Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the
original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint
embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space.
Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear
guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core
mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions
for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process,
e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then
demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a
minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve
asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that
in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint
embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker
alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not
only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the
empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging

*Rongwei Lu,Yutong Jiang,Jinrui Zhang,Chunyang Li,Yifei Zhu,Bin Chen,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为γ-FedHT的低成本压缩器，用于解决联邦学习中硬阈值压缩导致的精度下降问题，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的梯度压缩可以缓解通信瓶颈，但现有稀疏压缩器（如Top-k）计算复杂度高，而硬阈值压缩虽然复杂度低，却会导致精度下降。

Method: 提出γ-FedHT，一种步长感知的低成本压缩器，结合误差反馈机制，确保收敛性。

Result: 实验证明γ-FedHT在非独立同分布数据集上比Top-k提升精度高达7.42%，且收敛速率与FedAVG相同。

Conclusion: γ-FedHT是一种高效且低成本的压缩方法，适用于联邦学习中的通信优化。

Abstract: Gradient compression can effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks in
Federated Learning (FL). Contemporary state-of-the-art sparse compressors, such
as Top-$k$, exhibit high computational complexity, up to
$\mathcal{O}(d\log_2{k})$, where $d$ is the number of model parameters. The
hard-threshold compressor, which simply transmits elements with absolute values
higher than a fixed threshold, is thus proposed to reduce the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(d)$. However, the hard-threshold compression causes accuracy
degradation in FL, where the datasets are non-IID and the stepsize $\gamma$ is
decreasing for model convergence. The decaying stepsize reduces the updates and
causes the compression ratio of the hard-threshold compression to drop rapidly
to an aggressive ratio. At or below this ratio, the model accuracy has been
observed to degrade severely. To address this, we propose $\gamma$-FedHT, a
stepsize-aware low-cost compressor with Error-Feedback to guarantee
convergence. Given that the traditional theoretical framework of FL does not
consider Error-Feedback, we introduce the fundamental conversation of
Error-Feedback. We prove that $\gamma$-FedHT has the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ ($T$ representing total training iterations) under
$\mu$-strongly convex cases and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ under
non-convex cases, \textit{same as FedAVG}. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that $\gamma$-FedHT improves accuracy by up to $7.42\%$ over Top-$k$ under
equal communication traffic on various non-IID image datasets.

*Zongkai Liu,Fanqing Meng,Lingxiao Du,Zhixiang Zhou,Chao Yu,Wenqi Shao,Qiaosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CPGD的新算法，通过引入基于KL散度的策略漂移约束和剪裁机制，解决了基于规则的强化学习中训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的强化学习方法（如GRPO、REINFORCE++和RLOO）存在训练不稳定的问题，导致策略更新过大或剪裁不当，引发训练崩溃。

Method: CPGD算法通过KL散度动态正则化策略更新，并对策略更新的对数比进行剪裁，防止过度更新。

Result: 实验表明，CPGD有效缓解了训练不稳定性，同时显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: CPGD为语言模型的强化学习后训练提供了一种稳定且高效的方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly
improved the reasoning capability of language models (LMs) with rule-based
rewards. However, existing RL methods -- such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and RLOO --
often suffer from training instability, where large policy updates and improper
clipping can lead to training collapse. To address this issue, we propose
Clipped Policy Gradient Optimization with Policy Drift (CPGD), a novel
algorithm designed to stabilize policy learning in LMs. CPGD introduces a
policy drift constraint based on KL divergence to dynamically regularize policy
updates, and leverages a clip mechanism on the logarithm of the ratio to
prevent excessive policy updates. We provide theoretical justification for CPGD
and demonstrate through empirical analysis that it mitigates the instability
observed in prior approaches. Furthermore, we show that CPGD significantly
improves performance while maintaining training stability. Our implementation
balances theoretical rigor with practical usability, offering a robust
alternative for RL in the post-training of LMs. We release our code at
https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRM依赖标签数据，而本文旨在解决无标签数据下的不变性学习问题。

Method: 提出PICA（线性方法）和VIAE（深度生成模型），基于无监督结构因果模型，支持环境条件样本生成和干预。

Result: 在合成数据集和修改版MNIST上验证了方法的有效性，能够捕捉不变结构并跨环境泛化。

Conclusion: 无监督IRM框架在无标签数据下实现了鲁棒表示学习，扩展了IRM的应用范围。

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk
Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where
labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn
representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments.
In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution
alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We
introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component
Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under
Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep
generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and
environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel
``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned
sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset
and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in
capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and
generalizing across environments without access to labels.

TL;DR: InnateCoder利用基础模型中的人类知识，以零样本方式学习程序化策略，提高采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要从零开始学习，效率低下。InnateCoder旨在通过利用基础模型中的先验知识，加速学习过程。

Method: InnateCoder从基础模型中提取人类知识，生成程序化策略（选项），并通过组合这些选项构建更复杂的策略。

Result: 在MicroRTS和Karel the Robot实验中，InnateCoder表现出比不利用选项或从经验学习选项的系统更高的采样效率。

Conclusion: InnateCoder通过利用人类知识生成程序化策略，显著提高了强化学习中的采样效率。

Abstract: Outside of transfer learning settings, reinforcement learning agents start
their learning process from a clean slate. As a result, such agents have to go
through a slow process to learn even the most obvious skills required to solve
a problem. In this paper, we present InnateCoder, a system that leverages human
knowledge encoded in foundation models to provide programmatic policies that
encode "innate skills" in the form of temporally extended actions, or options.
In contrast to existing approaches to learning options, InnateCoder learns them
from the general human knowledge encoded in foundation models in a zero-shot
setting, and not from the knowledge the agent gains by interacting with the
environment. Then, InnateCoder searches for a programmatic policy by combining
the programs encoding these options into larger and more complex programs. We
hypothesized that InnateCoder's way of learning and using options could improve
the sampling efficiency of current methods for learning programmatic policies.
Empirical results in MicroRTS and Karel the Robot support our hypothesis, since
they show that InnateCoder is more sample efficient than versions of the system
that do not use options or learn them from experience.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过预算友好模型生成忠实解释的新方法，解决了现有模型无关技术因多次调用LLMs导致高成本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，解释其预测成为关键挑战，而现有模型无关技术因需多次调用LLMs导致经济成本高昂。

Method: 通过预算友好模型采样生成忠实解释，并进行实证研究验证其可行性。

Result: 代理解释不仅成本低，还能在下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的模型无关解释方法提供了新范式，结合预算友好模型的信息。

Abstract: With Large language models (LLMs) becoming increasingly prevalent in various
applications, the need for interpreting their predictions has become a critical
challenge. As LLMs vary in architecture and some are closed-sourced,
model-agnostic techniques show great promise without requiring access to the
model's internal parameters. However, existing model-agnostic techniques need
to invoke LLMs many times to gain sufficient samples for generating faithful
explanations, which leads to high economic costs. In this paper, we show that
it is practical to generate faithful explanations for large-scale LLMs by
sampling from some budget-friendly models through a series of empirical
studies. Moreover, we show that such proxy explanations also perform well on
downstream tasks. Our analysis provides a new paradigm of model-agnostic
explanation methods for LLMs, by including information from budget-friendly
models.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了持续学习中的关键挑战，提出了结合低秩适应、整合和顺序合并的新方法，显著提高了可扩展性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来深度学习模型需要持续学习和适应，但现有方法如重放成本高且未充分利用多任务微调技术。

Method: 应用低秩适应于持续学习，提出整合（减少重放样本）和顺序合并（结合任务算术），并展示其协同效应。

Result: 整合方法减少55%的重放样本需求，顺序合并与重放结合效果良好，整体工具集性能优于独立方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了持续学习的可扩展性和效率，为未来模型提供了实用工具集。

Abstract: Future deep learning models will be distinguished by systems that perpetually
learn through interaction, imagination, and cooperation, blurring the line
between training and inference. This makes continual learning a critical
challenge, as methods that efficiently maximize bidirectional transfer across
learning trajectories will be essential. Replay is on track to play a
foundational role in continual learning, allowing models to directly reconcile
new information with past knowledge. In practice, however, replay is quite
unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively.
Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the
multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable
techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled
toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks.
In this paper, we begin by applying and analyzing low rank adaptation in a
continual learning setting. Next, we introduce consolidation, a phasic approach
to replay which leads to up to 55\% less replay samples being needed for a
given performance target. Then, we propose sequential merging, an offshoot of
task arithmetic which is tailored to the continual learning setting and is
shown to work well in combination with replay. Finally, we demonstrate that the
developed strategies can operate synergistically, resulting in a highly
scalable toolset that outperforms standalone variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论工作未解释连续CoTs在推理任务中优于离散CoTs的原因，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 使用两层Transformer模型，通过连续CoTs生成叠加态向量，实现并行BFS。

Result: 连续CoTs仅需D步（图直径）即可解决问题，而离散CoTs需要O(n²)步。

Conclusion: 连续CoTs通过叠加态编码多路径搜索，显著提升了推理效率，且训练过程中无需显式监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts
(CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the
questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete
tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a
theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in
various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental
graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as
special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$
steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem,
where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of
constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps
where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each
continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search
frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while
discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state,
which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be
trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify
that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution
obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers
as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs,
without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths
simultaneously.

of supported network types, hardware platforms, and application scenarios. We
hope our review offers a clear synthesis of the evolving energy-aware DL
landscape and serves as a foundation for future research in energy-constrained

Motivation: TGNs在动态图中由于不规则的监督信号导致梯度更新稀疏，训练效率低下。

Method: 提出HAL方法，通过历史标签分布生成伪目标，动态丰富训练批次，减少梯度方差，加速收敛。

Result: 在TGB基准测试中，HAL将TGNv2的训练速度提升至多15倍，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: HAL是一种高效、轻量、架构无关且理论支持的解决方案，适用于时序图学习中的标签稀疏问题。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), while being accurate, face significant
training inefficiencies due to irregular supervision signals in dynamic graphs,
which induce sparse gradient updates. We first theoretically establish that
aggregating historical node interactions into pseudo-labels reduces gradient
variance, accelerating convergence. Building on this analysis, we propose
History-Averaged Labels (HAL), a method that dynamically enriches training
batches with pseudo-targets derived from historical label distributions. HAL
ensures continuous parameter updates without architectural modifications by
converting idle computation into productive learning steps. Experiments on the
Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) validate our findings and an assumption about
slow change of user preferences: HAL accelerates TGNv2 training by up to 15x
while maintaining competitive performance. Thus, this work offers an efficient,
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and theoretically motivated solution to
label sparsity in temporal graph learning.

Motivation: 现有方法通常要求在所有分数范围内实现完全公平，但这可能损害预测性能且不符合实际公平需求。

Method: 采用约束优化方法，通过非精确凸差算法（IDCA）训练模型，确保在特定分数范围内实现公平。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该框架在关键范围内实现了公平，同时保持了高预测性能。

Conclusion: 部分公平框架更符合实际需求，能够在关键区域实现公平而不牺牲整体性能。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has become a critical concern, particularly in
high-stakes applications. Existing approaches often focus on achieving full
fairness across all score ranges generated by predictive models, ensuring
fairness in both high and low-scoring populations. However, this stringent
requirement can compromise predictive performance and may not align with the
practical fairness concerns of stakeholders. In this work, we propose a novel
framework for building partially fair machine learning models, which enforce
fairness within a specific score range of interest, such as the middle range
where decisions are most contested, while maintaining flexibility in other
regions. We introduce two statistical metrics to rigorously evaluate partial
fairness within a given score range, such as the top 20%-40% of scores. To
achieve partial fairness, we propose an in-processing method by formulating the
model training problem as constrained optimization with difference-of-convex
constraints, which can be solved by an inexact difference-of-convex algorithm
(IDCA). We provide the complexity analysis of IDCA for finding a nearly KKT
point. Through numerical experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that our framework achieves high predictive performance while enforcing partial
fairness where it matters most.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现无监督嵌入翻译，但需注意其对数据安全的潜在风险。

Abstract: We introduce the first method for translating text embeddings from one vector
space to another without any paired data, encoders, or predefined sets of
matches. Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a
universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure
conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations
achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures,
parameter counts, and training datasets.
  The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while
preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector
databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract
sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for
classification and attribute inference.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于截断统计的差分隐私算法设计提供了通用蓝图。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for differentially private (DP) statistical
estimation via data truncation, addressing a key challenge in DP estimation
when the data support is unbounded. Traditional approaches rely on
problem-specific sensitivity analysis, limiting their applicability. By
leveraging techniques from truncated statistics, we develop computationally
efficient DP estimators for exponential family distributions, including
Gaussian mean and covariance estimation, achieving near-optimal sample
complexity. Previous works on exponential families only consider bounded or
one-dimensional families. Our approach mitigates sensitivity through truncation
while carefully correcting for the introduced bias using maximum likelihood
estimation and DP stochastic gradient descent. Along the way, we establish
improved uniform convergence guarantees for the log-likelihood function of
exponential families, which may be of independent interest. Our results provide
a general blueprint for DP algorithm design via truncated statistics.

Conclusion: Alternator++通过显式建模噪声项，显著提升了时间序列任务的性能，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling
time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as
state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This
paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances
the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise
terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea
of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes
the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the
noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise
trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time
series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong
baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.

Abstract: Real-world systems, from aerospace to railway engineering, are modeled with
partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the physics of the system.
Estimating robust solutions for such problems is essential. Deep learning-based
architectures, such as neural PDE solvers, have recently gained traction as a
reliable solution method. The current state of development of these approaches,
however, primarily focuses on improving accuracy. The environmental impact of
excessive computation, leading to increased carbon emissions, has largely been
overlooked. This paper introduces a carbon emission measure for a range of PDE
solvers. Our proposed metric, EcoL2, balances model accuracy with emissions
across data collection, model training, and deployment. Experiments across both
physics-informed machine learning and operator learning architectures
demonstrate that the proposed metric presents a holistic assessment of model
performance and emission cost. As such solvers grow in scale and deployment,
EcoL2 represents a step toward building performant scientific machine learning
systems with lower long-term environmental impact.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巨型DNN在云端AI服务中不可或缺，但其服务成本高昂，尤其是能源消耗远超训练阶段。现有方法无法同时优化能源效率和推理准确性。

Method: HybridServe采用基于置信度的混合模型服务数据流，优先使用能源效率高的小型模型，同时通过数据流规划器优化模型分区和复制。

Conclusion: HybridServe通过混合模型服务，显著降低了能源消耗，同时保持了高准确性，为大规模DNN服务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Giant Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become indispensable for accurate and
robust support of large-scale cloud based AI services. However, serving giant
DNNs is prohibitively expensive from an energy consumption viewpoint easily
exceeding that of training, due to the enormous scale of GPU clusters needed to
hold giant DNN model partitions and replicas. Existing approaches can either
optimize energy efficiency or inference accuracy but not both. To overcome this
status quo, we propose HybridServe, a novel hybrid DNN model serving system
that leverages multiple sized versions (small to giant) of the model to be
served in tandem. Through a confidence based hybrid model serving dataflow,
HybridServe prefers to serve inference requests with energy-efficient smaller
models so long as accuracy is not compromised, thereby reducing the number of
replicas needed for giant DNNs. HybridServe also features a dataflow planner
for efficient partitioning and replication of candidate models to maximize
serving system throughput. Experimental results using a prototype
implementation of HybridServe show that it reduces energy footprint by up to
19.8x compared to the state-of-the-art DNN model serving systems while matching
the accuracy of serving solely with giant DNNs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了自监督学习（SSL）中维度崩溃问题，提出通过动态调整特征解相关和样本均匀分布的损失权重来优化表示空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习的关键是避免维度崩溃，但目前对训练动态及其对下游任务性能的影响缺乏理解。

Method: 提出AdaDim方法，动态权衡特征解相关和样本均匀分布的损失权重。

Result: 最佳SSL模型并非具有最高H(R)或最低I(R;Z)，而是达到两者的中间最优值。

Conclusion: 通过分析训练动态，AdaDim方法能更有效地优化SSL表示空间。

Abstract: A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing
dimensional collapse, which is where higher-dimensional representation spaces
span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies
involve guiding a model to produce representations ($R$) with a higher
dimensionality. Dimensionality is either optimized through a
dimension-contrastive approach that encourages feature decorrelation or through
a sample-contrastive method that promotes a uniform spread of sample
representations. Both families of SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head
that maps $R$ into a lower-dimensional embedding space $Z$. Recent work has
characterized the projection head as a filter of irrelevant features from the
SSL objective by reducing mutual information, $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current
literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high
$H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of the problem is lacking in
terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences
both terms, as well as how the values of $H(R)$ and $I(R;Z)$ arrived at the end
of training reflect the downstream performance of an SSL model. We address both
gaps in the literature by demonstrating that increases in $H(R)$ due to feature
decorrelation at the start of training lead to a higher $I(R;Z)$, while
increases in $H(R)$ due to samples distributing uniformly in a high-dimensional
space at the end of training cause $I(R;Z)$ to plateau or decrease.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have
the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but arrive at an optimal
intermediate point for both. We develop a method called AdaDim to exploit these
observed training dynamics by adaptively weighting between losses based on
feature decorrelation and uniform sample spread.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaPEFT是一种基于Hessian信息的参数高效微调方法，通过多任务优化选择最有影响力的参数子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效选择参数子集以优化PEFT方法的性能。

Method: 将子集选择建模为多任务问题，利用ε约束法和二阶泰勒近似转化为0-1背包问题，并通过Pareto最优性求解。

Result: 提出的AdaPEFT方法能够适应不同任务和模型，且所选子集在不同训练范围和模型规模中具有可迁移性。

Conclusion: AdaPEFT通过优化参数子集选择，显著提升了PEFT方法的效率和性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a highly effective approach for
adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks with minimal
computational overhead. At the core, PEFT methods freeze most parameters and
only trains a small subset (say $<0.1\%$ of total parameters). Notably,
different PEFT methods select different subsets, resulting in varying levels of
performance. This variation prompts a key question: how to effectively select
the most influential subset to train?
  We formulate the subset selection as a multi-task problem: maximizing the
performance and minimizing the number of trainable parameters. We leverage a
series of transformations -- including $\epsilon$-constraint method and
second-order Taylor approximation -- to arrive at the classical 0-1 knapsack
problem, which we solve through the lens of Pareto optimality. Consequently, we
propose AdaPEFT, a Hessian-informed PEFT that adapts to various tasks and
models, in which the selected subset empirically transfers across training
horizons and model sizes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法和指标，用于定量分析数据增强对卷积神经网络在图像分类任务中学习模式的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强被广泛采用，但缺乏研究分析其对神经网络学习模式的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用类激活图（CAM）识别和测量模型对图像像素的重要性，并通过提取指标比较不同数据增强策略的效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效分析数据增强的影响，并识别其对模型的不同影响模式。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为定量分析数据增强对神经网络的影响提供了新视角。

Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the last few years as an
effective tool for the task of image classification due to the impressive
performance they have achieved on this task. In image classification tasks, it
is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of
trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting.
Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks
a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the
patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The
primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics
that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data
augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An
important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class
activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the
importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when
executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics
over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models
trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies.
Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data
augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us
to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.

TL;DR: FreKoo通过频域分析和Koopman算子解决动态环境中的概念漂移问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型在动态环境中性能下降，现有方法难以处理复杂的真实漂移（如长期结构和局部不确定性）。

Method: FreKoo利用傅里叶变换将参数演化分解为不同频带，低频部分通过Koopman算子学习，高频部分通过时间正则化平滑。

Result: 实验表明FreKoo在复杂漂移和不确定性的真实场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreKoo通过频域分析和理论支持，有效解决了动态环境中的概念漂移问题。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models struggle to maintain performance in dynamic
environments where temporal distribution shifts, \emph{i.e., concept drift},
are prevalent. Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to enable model
generalization across evolving domains, yet existing approaches typically
assume smooth incremental changes, struggling with complex real-world drifts
involving long-term structure (incremental evolution/periodicity) and local
uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreKoo, which
tackles these challenges via a novel frequency-domain analysis of parameter
trajectories. It leverages the Fourier transform to disentangle parameter
evolution into distinct spectral bands. Specifically, low-frequency component
with dominant dynamics are learned and extrapolated using the Koopman operator,
robustly capturing diverse drift patterns including both incremental and
periodicity. Simultaneously, potentially disruptive high-frequency variations
are smoothed via targeted temporal regularization, preventing overfitting to
transient noise and domain uncertainties. In addition, this dual spectral
strategy is rigorously grounded through theoretical analysis, providing
stability guarantees for the Koopman prediction, a principled Bayesian
justification for the high-frequency regularization, and culminating in a
multiscale generalization bound connecting spectral dynamics to improved
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate FreKoo's significant
superiority over SOTA TDG approaches, particularly excelling in real-world
streaming scenarios with complex drifts and uncertainties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的插件式检测框架，利用目标模型内部的层间不一致性，仅需良性数据进行校准，显著提升了对抗样本检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到对抗样本的攻击，现有检测方法依赖外部模型或复杂架构，效率低且泛化性差。

Method: 基于“少数大偏移假设”，提出两种互补策略：恢复测试（RT）和Logit层测试（LT），以揭示对抗样本引起的内部扰动。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上，该方法在标准及自适应威胁模型下均达到最优检测性能，计算开销可忽略且不影响干净数据准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、轻量且通用，为对抗样本检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial
examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect
predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to
adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex
architectures, heavy augmentations, or adversarial data, limiting their
efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection
framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target
model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is
grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial
perturbations typically induce large representation shifts in a small subset of
layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery
Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to expose internal disruptions
caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under
both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art
detection performance with negligible computational overhead and no compromise
to clean accuracy.

*Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)的简单路由方法，用于选择最适合的大语言模型（LLMs），并在多样化任务中表现优于复杂的路由策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs规模和专业化的增长，高效的路由选择变得至关重要，但现有复杂路由方法依赖不一致的训练数据和评估设置，难以比较和泛化。

Method: 通过kNN方法进行路由选择，并引入一套标准化路由基准，涵盖指令遵循、问答、推理任务以及多模态路由数据集。

Result: kNN方法在嵌入空间的局部性特性支持下，能以较低样本复杂度实现强路由决策，甚至优于复杂方法。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了复杂架构的趋势，强调在投资复杂解决方案前应充分评估简单基线方法，并提供了标准化基准和代码以支持复现和进一步探索。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and specialization,
routing--selecting the best model for a given input--has become essential for
efficient and effective deployment. While recent methods rely on complex
learned routing strategies, their dependence on disparate training data and
evaluation setups makes comparison and generalization difficult. In this work,
we revisit LLM routing through the lens of simplicity. We show that a
well-tuned k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach not only matches but often
outperforms state-of-the-art learned routers across diverse tasks. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce a suite of standardized routing benchmarks
spanning instruction-following, question-answering, and reasoning tasks, as
well as the first multi-modal routing dataset involving visual inputs. Our
findings reveal that the locality properties of model performance in embedding
space enable simple non-parametric methods to achieve strong routing decisions
with lower sample complexity than parametric approaches. This challenges the
prevailing trend toward sophisticated architectures and highlights the
importance of thoroughly evaluating simple baselines before investing in
complex solutions. To support reproducibility and further exploration, we will
release all benchmarks and code upon publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADOPS的新方法，用于在稀疏奖励环境中更有效地利用内在动机（IM），解决了传统PBRS方法在复杂探索环境中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PBRS方法（如GRM和PIES）在复杂、探索密集且持续时间长的环境中表现不佳，可能导致次优策略。

Method: 提出ADOPS方法，将内在奖励转换为保持最优性的形式，适用于动作依赖的场景，突破了PBRS的限制。

Result: ADOPS在Montezuma's Revenge等极端稀疏奖励环境中表现优异，能够保持最优策略集。

Conclusion: ADOPS是一种更灵活且有效的奖励塑形方法，适用于复杂稀疏奖励环境，优于传统PBRS方法。

Abstract: Recent RL research has utilized reward shaping--particularly complex shaping
rewards such as intrinsic motivation (IM)--to encourage agent exploration in
sparse-reward environments. While often effective, ``reward hacking'' can lead
to the shaping reward being optimized at the expense of the extrinsic reward,
resulting in a suboptimal policy. Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS)
techniques such as Generalized Reward Matching (GRM) and Policy-Invariant
Explicit Shaping (PIES) have mitigated this. These methods allow for
implementing IM without altering optimal policies. In this work we show that
they are effectively unsuitable for complex, exploration-heavy environments
with long-duration episodes. To remedy this, we introduce Action-Dependent
Optimality Preserving Shaping (ADOPS), a method of converting intrinsic rewards
to an optimality-preserving form that allows agents to utilize IM more
effectively in the extremely sparse environment of Montezuma's Revenge. We also
prove ADOPS accommodates reward shaping functions that cannot be written in a
potential-based form: while PBRS-based methods require the cumulative
discounted intrinsic return be independent of actions, ADOPS allows for
intrinsic cumulative returns to be dependent on agents' actions while still
preserving the optimal policy set. We show how action-dependence enables
ADOPS's to preserve optimality while learning in complex, sparse-reward
environments where other methods struggle.

Motivation: 现实应用中，图数据可能包含过时、不准确或隐私敏感信息，需要高效删除这些数据，但现有方法存在不完全或过度遗忘问题。

Method: 提出AGU框架，灵活适应不同遗忘任务和图神经网络架构，确保完全遗忘删除元素并保留剩余图的完整性。

Result: 在七个真实世界图上实验表明，AGU在有效性、效率和遗忘能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGU为图神经网络中的遗忘任务提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph unlearning, which deletes graph elements such as nodes and edges from
trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial for real-world applications
where graph data may contain outdated, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive
information. However, existing methods often suffer from (1) incomplete or over
unlearning due to neglecting the distinct objectives of different unlearning
tasks, and (2) inaccurate identification of neighbors affected by deleted
elements across various GNN architectures. To address these limitations, we
propose AGU, a novel Adaptive Graph Unlearning framework that flexibly adapts
to diverse unlearning tasks and GNN architectures. AGU ensures the complete
forgetting of deleted elements while preserving the integrity of the remaining
graph. It also accurately identifies affected neighbors for each GNN
architecture and prioritizes important ones to enhance unlearning performance.
Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs demonstrate that AGU
outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and
unlearning capability.

Result: 在多数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了特征生成中的关键问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Feature generation involves creating new features from raw data to capture
complex relationships among the original features, improving model robustness
and machine learning performance. Current methods using reinforcement learning
for feature generation have made feature exploration more flexible and
efficient. However, several challenges remain: first, during feature expansion,
a large number of redundant features are generated. When removing them, current
methods only retain the best features each round, neglecting those that perform
poorly initially but could improve later. Second, the state representation used
by current methods fails to fully capture complex feature relationships. Third,
there are significant differences between discrete and continuous features in
tabular data, requiring different operations for each type. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel dual-agent reinforcement learning method for
feature generation. Two agents are designed: the first generates new features,
and the second determines whether they should be preserved. A self-attention
mechanism enhances state representation, and diverse operations distinguish
interactions between discrete and continuous features. The experimental results
on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. The
code is available at https://github.com/extess0/DARL.

Conclusion: 潜在标记方法能有效提升LLMs的适应性，且对现有Transformer基础设施的复杂度影响极小。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as
a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we
introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens
that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive
decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The
proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained
Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at
inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing
infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks
accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method
noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution
generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the
adaptability of LLMs.

Conclusion: ToT算法为解决深度学习模型的不可解释性和高风险领域应用提供了一种潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) can automatically construct intelligent agents, deep
neural networks (alternatively, DL models), that can outperform humans in
certain tasks. However, the operating principles of DL remain poorly
understood, making its decisions incomprehensible. As a result, it poses a
great risk to deploy DL in high-stakes domains in which mistakes or errors may
lead to critical consequences. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm that can
help DL models make more robust decisions by allowing them to abstain from
answering when they are uncertain. Our algorithm, named `Two out of Three
(ToT)', is inspired by the sensitivity of the human brain to conflicting
information. ToT creates two alternative predictions in addition to the
original model prediction and uses the alternative predictions to decide
whether it should provide an answer or not.

Conclusion: SNNs在无线通信安全中具有潜力，但需结合防御技术（如自编码器）以应对对抗攻击。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool that can solve complex problems, and
thus, it seems natural to assume that DL can be used to enhance the security of
wireless communication. However, deploying DL models to edge devices in
wireless networks is challenging, as they require significant amounts of
computing and power resources. Notably, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are
known to be efficient in terms of power consumption, meaning they can be an
alternative platform for DL models for edge devices. In this study, we ask if
SNNs can be used in physical layer authentication. Our evaluation suggests that
SNNs can learn unique physical properties (i.e., `fingerprints') of RF
transmitters and use them to identify individual devices. Furthermore, we find
that SNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that an autoencoder
can be used clean out adversarial perturbations to harden SNNs against them.

Conclusion: TransferTraj通过创新的模块设计和统一的任务迁移方案，显著提升了轨迹学习的迁移能力。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports
various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning
model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining,
avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar
performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique
spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns
and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks
faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required
for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve
learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region
transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.
  To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS
trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability.
For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module
within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network
modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context
distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating
relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for
handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we
propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output
structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and
trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and
transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on
three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot,
and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.

Conclusion: 对抗性学习可以转化为跨域迁移的正则化力量，为迁移学习提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a
fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning
systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats
that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also
serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in
enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We
analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training,
improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing
overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and
domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home --
demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance
under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results
highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming
perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for
cross-domain transferability.

Conclusion: 该方法为非侵入式，不影响模型质量，能有效识别模型使用。

Abstract: AI developers are releasing large language models (LLMs) under a variety of
different licenses. Many of these licenses restrict the ways in which the
models or their outputs may be used. This raises the question how license
violations may be recognized. In particular, how can we identify that an API or
product uses (an adapted version of) a particular LLM? We present a new method
that enable model developers to perform such identification via fingerprints:
statistical patterns that are unique to the developer's model and robust to
common alterations of that model. Our method permits model identification in a
black-box setting using a limited number of queries, enabling identification of
models that can only be accessed via an API or product. The fingerprints are
non-invasive: our method does not require any changes to the model during
training, hence by design, it does not impact model quality. Empirically, we
find our method provides a high degree of robustness to common changes in the
model or inference settings. In our experiments, it substantially outperforms
prior art, including invasive methods that explicitly train watermarks into the
model.

TL;DR: DimGrow是一种轻量级方法，通过动态调整特征字段的嵌入维度，避免了传统方法中需要训练内存密集型SuperNet的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如剪枝或神经架构搜索）需要训练SuperNet，这在大型特征空间中不可行。DimGrow旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DimGrow从每个特征字段的一个维度开始训练，通过重要性评分逐步扩展或缩小维度，仅在重要性超过阈值时才增加维度。

Result: 在三个推荐数据集上的实验表明，DimGrow有效且比基于SuperNet的方法节省训练内存。

Conclusion: DimGrow提供了一种高效、内存友好的维度分配方法，适用于大规模特征空间。

Abstract: Key feature fields need bigger embedding dimensionality, others need smaller.
This demands automated dimension allocation. Existing approaches, such as
pruning or Neural Architecture Search (NAS), require training a
memory-intensive SuperNet that enumerates all possible dimension combinations,
which is infeasible for large feature spaces. We propose DimGrow, a lightweight
approach that eliminates the SuperNet requirement. Starting training model from
one dimension per feature field, DimGrow can progressively expand/shrink
dimensions via importance scoring. Dimensions grow only when their importance
consistently exceed a threshold, ensuring memory efficiency. Experiments on
three recommendation datasets verify the effectiveness of DimGrow while it

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习（FGL）和图基础模型（GFM）各有局限性，但互补性强。结合两者可以提升性能，但面临知识纠缠的挑战。

Method: 提出FedGFM+框架，包含AncDAI（全局锚点初始化）和AdaDPP（本地自适应提示池）模块，以减少知识纠缠。

Result: 在8个多样化的基准测试中，FedGFM+优于20个基线方法，涵盖监督学习、FGL和联邦GFM变体。

Conclusion: FedGFM+通过解决知识纠缠问题，成功整合了FGL和GFM的优势，展现出强大的跨领域适应能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric
paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL)
enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task
heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM)
offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines,
missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable
benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM
training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where
multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering
downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core
modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based
domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes
its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors.
Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We
theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains,
providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2)
AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a
lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During
fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects
relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream
adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated
GFM variants.

TL;DR: RoVo是一种新型的主动防御技术，通过在高维嵌入向量中注入对抗性扰动来保护语音信号，有效抵御语音合成攻击和语音增强模型的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI语音合成技术的进步，语音欺骗攻击（如语音钓鱼和假新闻）的风险增加，现有防御方法效果有限。

Method: RoVo在高维嵌入向量中注入对抗性扰动，重构为受保护的语音信号。

Result: 实验显示，RoVo将防御成功率（DSR）提高了70%以上，在商业语音验证API上达到99.5%的DSR，且对语音增强模型保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RoVo在复杂威胁场景中有效保护语音信号，同时保持语音的自然性和可用性。

Abstract: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep
Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice
phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing
defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have
limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by
speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo
(Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial
perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals,
reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends
against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech
enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat.
  In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by
over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech
synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial
speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack.
Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech
enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study
confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected
speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在医疗和机器人等领域潜力巨大，但缺乏可解释性阻碍了其应用。反事实解释为理解RL决策提供了可能，但在连续动作空间中研究不足。

Method: 利用连续动作的距离度量，计算替代动作序列，同时考虑预定义策略等约束。

Result: 在糖尿病控制和月球着陆两个RL领域验证了方法的有效性、效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了RL应用的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in domains like
healthcare and robotics but often struggles with adoption due to its lack of
interpretability. Counterfactual explanations, which address "what if"
scenarios, provide a promising avenue for understanding RL decisions but remain
underexplored for continuous action spaces. We propose a novel approach for
generating counterfactual explanations in continuous action RL by computing
alternative action sequences that improve outcomes while minimizing deviations
from the original sequence. Our approach leverages a distance metric for
continuous actions and accounts for constraints such as adhering to predefined
policies in specific states. Evaluations in two RL domains, Diabetes Control
and Lunar Lander, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization
of our approach, enabling more interpretable and trustworthy RL applications.

Abstract: Advances in deep generative modelling have made it increasingly plausible to
train human-level embodied agents. Yet progress has been limited by the absence
of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that
reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this,
we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing
multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video,
game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each
modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of
synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset
comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global
participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of
an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the
dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for
benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness,
language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward
training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time,
paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域适应方法假设源图和目标图间分布偏移较小，难以应对现实中的大偏移；渐进域适应方法虽有效，但未扩展到非IID图数据。

Method: 采用Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW)距离作为非IID图的域差异度量，推导误差界并确定FGW测地线为最优路径，提出生成路径的算法。

Result: Gadget框架显著提升现有图域适应方法性能，节点分类准确率最高提升6.8%。

Conclusion: Gadget为非IID图数据的渐进域适应提供了理论和实践基础，有效应对大分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks, despite their impressive performance, are highly
vulnerable to distribution shifts on graphs. Existing graph domain adaptation
(graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a \textit{mild} shift between source
and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with
\textit{large} shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a
promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source
model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains.
Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically
distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to
\textit{non-IID graphs without a given path} an open challenge. To bridge this
gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First
(\textit{theoretical foundation}), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance
is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we
derive an error bound revealing that the target domain error is proportional to
the length of the path. Second (\textit{optimal path}), guided by the error
bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be
efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be
seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on
graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8\% in node
classification accuracy on real-world datasets.

Method: 提出可靠迁移框架，结合信任评估模型和CGDM算法，优化迁移决策。

Result: CGDM算法显著降低系统延迟并提升抗网络攻击能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了车载AI代理迁移中的资源调度和安全性挑战。

Abstract: Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent
transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles,
users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are
endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution
capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to
provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents
require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle
mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in
RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among
them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may
expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose
a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic
migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between
vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on
the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs,
thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We
then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable
markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion
Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical
results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline
methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber
attacks.

Motivation: 边缘计算中多输入多输出（MIMO）检测任务需要高效能模型部署，现有量化方法因依赖参数化分布假设和静态量化步长导致性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，KAQ框架在精度上优于传统方法，并成功降低了模型推理延迟。

Conclusion: KAQ框架为资源受限的边缘设备提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著提升了模型部署的性能和效率。

Abstract: The development of edge computing places critical demands on energy-efficient
model deployment for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection tasks.
Deploying deep unfolding models such as PGD-Nets and ADMM-Nets into
resource-constrained edge devices using quantization methods is challenging.
Existing quantization methods based on quantization aware training (QAT) suffer
from performance degradation due to their reliance on parametric distribution
assumption of activations and static quantization step sizes. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based adaptive quantization
(KAQ) framework for deep unfolding networks. By utilizing a joint kernel
density estimation (KDE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) approach to align
activation distributions between full-precision and quantized models, the need
for prior distribution assumptions is eliminated. Additionally, a dynamic step
size updating method is introduced to adjust the quantization step size based
on the channel conditions of wireless networks. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the accuracy of proposed KAQ framework outperforms traditional
methods and successfully reduces the model's inference latency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OTA的方法，通过改进价值函数来提升离线目标导向强化学习在长时任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标导向强化学习（GCRL）在长时任务中表现不佳，主要原因是高层策略无法生成合适的子目标，且优势信号不准确。

Method: 提出OTA方法，将时间抽象引入时间差分学习过程，通过改进价值更新使其具备选项感知能力，从而缩短有效时域长度。

Result: 在OGBench基准测试中，OTA方法在迷宫导航和视觉机器人操作等复杂任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: OTA通过改进价值函数，显著提升了离线GCRL在长时任务中的性能。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a practical
learning paradigm where goal-reaching policies are trained from abundant
unlabeled (reward-free) datasets without additional environment interaction.
However, offline GCRL still struggles with long-horizon tasks, even with recent
advances that employ hierarchical policy structures, such as HIQL. By
identifying the root cause of this challenge, we observe the following
insights: First, performance bottlenecks mainly stem from the high-level
policy's inability to generate appropriate subgoals. Second, when learning the
high-level policy in the long-horizon regime, the sign of the advantage signal
frequently becomes incorrect. Thus, we argue that improving the value function
to produce a clear advantage signal for learning the high-level policy is
essential. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution:
Option-aware Temporally Abstracted value learning, dubbed OTA, which
incorporates temporal abstraction into the temporal-difference learning
process. By modifying the value update to be option-aware, the proposed
learning scheme contracts the effective horizon length, enabling better
advantage estimates even in long-horizon regimes. We experimentally show that
the high-level policy extracted using the OTA value function achieves strong
performance on complex tasks from OGBench, a recently proposed offline GCRL
benchmark, including maze navigation and visual robotic manipulation
environments.

Abstract: Advanced epidemic forecasting is critical for enabling precision containment
strategies, highlighting its strategic importance for public health security.
While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential
for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal
epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic
transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch
architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex
epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the
multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we
propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic
forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception
of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which
strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive
experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on
real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of
LLMs.

Motivation: 数据增强在单源域泛化中广泛应用，但现有方法在训练过程中性能波动显著，导致模型选择困难。作者认为波动源于模型无法有效积累多样化增强数据的学习知识。

Method: 提出PEER方法，使用代理模型学习增强数据，主模型通过参数平均逐步积累知识，并通过最大化两模型输出表示的互信息来缓解特征扭曲。

Result: 实验表明PEER能有效减少OOD性能波动，并在多个数据集（PACS、Digits、Office-Home、VLCS）上实现优于现有方法的泛化性能。

Conclusion: PEER通过简单随机增强即达到SOTA性能，优于依赖复杂数据增强策略的现有方法。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a popular tool for single source domain generalization,
which expands the source domain by generating simulated ones, improving
generalization on unseen target domains. In this work, we show that the
performance of such augmentation-based methods in the target domains
universally fluctuates during training, posing challenges in model selection
under realistic scenarios. We argue that the fluctuation stems from the
inability of the model to accumulate the knowledge learned from diverse
augmentations, exacerbating feature distortion during training. Based on this
observation, we propose a novel generalization method, coined Parameter-Space
Ensemble with Entropy Regularization (PEER), that uses a proxy model to learn
the augmented data on behalf of the main model. The main model is updated by
averaging its parameters with the proxy model, progressively accumulating
knowledge over the training steps. Maximizing the mutual information between
the output representations of the two models guides the learning process of the
proxy model, mitigating feature distortion during training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PEER in reducing the OOD performance
fluctuation and enhancing generalization across various datasets, including
PACS, Digits, Office-Home, and VLCS. Notably, our method with simple random
augmentation achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior approaches
on sDG that utilize complex data augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare,
manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods
for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the
first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data
follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We
introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a
high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers
using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and
RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also
propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming
scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real
datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel
method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.
MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust
multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing
approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved
robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses
online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation
Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and
dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids
retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior
efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in
cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a
Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a
method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.

Conclusion: ProDS通过偏好对齐显著提升数据选择效果。

Abstract: Instruction data selection aims to identify a high-quality subset from the
training set that matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset on
target tasks. Existing methods focus on the instruction-to-response mapping,
but neglect the human preference for diverse responses. In this paper, we
propose Preference-oriented Data Selection method (ProDS) that scores training
samples based on their alignment with preferences observed in the target set.
Our key innovation lies in shifting the data selection criteria from merely
estimating features for accurate response generation to explicitly aligning
training samples with human preferences in target tasks. Specifically, direct
preference optimization (DPO) is employed to estimate human preferences across
diverse responses. Besides, a bidirectional preference synthesis strategy is
designed to score training samples according to both positive preferences and
negative preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our
superiority to existing task-agnostic and targeted methods.

Motivation: 传统RL方法在固定数据集上优化的策略泛化性差，无法适应市场的非平稳性。

Method: MetaTrader采用双层学习框架，同时优化原始数据集和多样化变换数据上的性能，并引入新的TD方法解决价值高估问题。

Result: 在两个公开股票数据集上，MetaTrader优于现有RL方法和传统股票预测模型。

Conclusion: MetaTrader通过改进泛化能力和解决价值高估问题，在投资组合优化任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown significant promise for sequential
portfolio optimization tasks, such as stock trading, where the objective is to
maximize cumulative returns while minimizing risks using historical data.
However, traditional RL approaches often produce policies that merely memorize
the optimal yet impractical buying and selling behaviors within the fixed
dataset. These offline policies are less generalizable as they fail to account
for the non-stationary nature of the market. Our approach, MetaTrader, frames
portfolio optimization as a new type of partial-offline RL problem and makes
two technical contributions. First, MetaTrader employs a bilevel learning
framework that explicitly trains the RL agent to improve both in-domain profits
on the original dataset and out-of-domain performance across diverse
transformations of the raw financial data. Second, our approach incorporates a
new temporal difference (TD) method that approximates worst-case TD estimates
from a batch of transformed TD targets, addressing the value overestimation
issue that is particularly challenging in scenarios with limited offline data.
Our empirical results on two public stock datasets show that MetaTrader
outperforms existing methods, including both RL-based approaches and
traditional stock prediction models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的跨变量补丁嵌入（CVPE）模块，通过修改补丁嵌入过程，将跨变量上下文注入到通道独立（CI）模型中，从而提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在时间序列预测中主要关注时间依赖性，而忽略了变量间的复杂关系。虽然近期模型尝试通过注意力机制同时建模时间和变量依赖，但它们完全依赖通道（CD），容易过拟合。

Method: 提出CVPE模块，通过在补丁嵌入层添加可学习的位置编码和轻量级路由器注意力块，将跨变量上下文注入CI模型。将CVPE集成到Time-LLM模型中验证其有效性。

Result: 在七个真实数据集上的实验表明，仅添加CVPE模块的Time-LLM显著优于原始基线模型。

Conclusion: CVPE模块能有效捕捉跨变量依赖，提升CI模型的性能，且无需其他改动。

Abstract: Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due
to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing
models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate
relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by
explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a
sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel
dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to
overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE),
a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into
channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding
process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a
lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We
then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to
demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and
enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven
real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original
baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However,
existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the
performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately
assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several
evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a
phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human
preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy.
The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable
benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and
rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires
multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and
(iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse
representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However,
we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of
overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain
downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to
use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.

TL;DR: FedSVD通过SVD重新参数化LoRA，解决了DP-SGD中的噪声放大问题，提升了联邦学习中的模型性能和稳定性。

Method: 提出FedSVD，客户端仅优化B矩阵，服务器通过SVD重新参数化BA，生成新的A和B。

Result: FedSVD在多种隐私设置和基准测试中表现优于基线，提升了稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: FedSVD通过SVD重新参数化有效解决了噪声放大问题，适用于隐私和非隐私场景。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which introduces a product of two trainable
low-rank matrices into frozen pre-trained weights, is widely used for efficient
fine-tuning of language models in federated learning (FL). However, when
combined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA
faces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients,
and the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this
effect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model
expressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we
propose FedSVD, a simple yet effective method that introduces a global
reparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our
approach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the
server. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using
the previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new
adaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an
updated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components. This reparameterization
avoids quadratic noise amplification, while allowing $A$ to better capture the
principal directions of the aggregate updates. Moreover, the orthonormal
structure of $A$ bounds the gradient norms of $B$ and preserves more signal
under DP-SGD, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. As a result, FedSVD
consistently improves stability and performance across a variety of privacy
settings and benchmarks, outperforming relevant baselines under both private
and non-private regimes.

Method: 引入Koopman自编码器，将神经表示视为动态系统状态，通过线性空间操作和拓扑保持正则化学习代理模型。

Result: 代理模型能复现神经网络中观察到的渐进拓扑简化，并在Yin-Yang和MNIST任务中实现目标类别遗忘。

Conclusion: Koopman自编码器为神经网络表示动态建模提供了有效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores a simple question: can we model the internal
transformations of a neural network using dynamical systems theory? We
introduce Koopman autoencoders to capture how neural representations evolve
through network layers, treating these representations as states in a dynamical
system. Our approach learns a surrogate model that predicts how neural
representations transform from input to output, with two key advantages. First,
by way of lifting the original states via an autoencoder, it operates in a
linear space, making editing the dynamics straightforward. Second, it preserves
the topologies of the original representations by regularizing the autoencoding
objective. We demonstrate that these surrogate models naturally replicate the
progressive topological simplification observed in neural networks. As a
practical application, we show how our approach enables targeted class
unlearning in the Yin-Yang and MNIST classification tasks.

Result: 研究发现iForest对中心异常敏感性较低，参数适应性优于k-NN。

Conclusion: 本文为iForest的有效性提供了理论支持，并为进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly
detector valued for its exceptional runtime efficiency and performance on
large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation
explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper theoretically
investigates the conditions and extent of iForest's effectiveness by analyzing
its inductive bias through the formulation of depth functions and growth
processes. Since directly analyzing the depth function proves intractable due
to iForest's random splitting mechanism, we model the growth process of iForest
as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function using
transition probabilities. Our case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest
exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater
parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor anomaly detectors. Our
study provides theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and
establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯混合模型（GEM）的新方法，用于检测GUI代理中的分布外（OOD）指令，显著提升了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理在执行超出其能力范围或违反环境约束的指令时可能导致任务失败或安全威胁，传统OOD检测方法效果不佳。

Method: 通过观察GUI代理的输入语义空间聚类模式，提出GEM方法，利用高斯混合模型拟合输入嵌入距离以反映能力边界。

Result: 在8个数据集上测试，平均准确率提升23.70%，并在9种不同骨干网络上验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GEM方法在GUI代理的OOD检测中表现出色，具有广泛适用性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing
paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing
user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when
encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental
constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer
task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD
detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods
perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and
evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution
input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect
to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a
novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding
distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary.
Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers,
our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the
best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our
method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available

TL;DR: FiMi-RM框架通过自主学习和纠正奖励模型中的长度偏差，解决了RLHF中的奖励黑客问题，特别是长度偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF中的奖励模型常因长度偏差而无法真实反映人类偏好，现有方法未能准确建模或纠正这种偏差。

Method: FiMi-RM分三阶段：训练含偏差的奖励模型，用轻量级模型捕捉非线性长度-奖励关系，并整合以去偏。

Result: 实验显示FiMi-RM平衡了长度-奖励分布，提升了长度控制胜率并减少冗余。

Conclusion: FiMi-RM有效解决了长度偏差问题，提升了奖励模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align
large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from
reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward
model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human
preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where
reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response
quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these
approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply
assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate
nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose
FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a
framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our
approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model
which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting
model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward.
Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias.
Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced
length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms,
our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces
verbosity without compromising its performance.

Result: LoRA对后门攻击更鲁棒，但对无目标数据投毒更脆弱。

Conclusion: LoRA的低秩结构在安全性上具有双重性，需在实际应用中权衡其效率与安全性。

Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains
over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance
and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks
remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we
theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank
structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data
poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models
LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the
analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish
connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against
training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better
robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more
vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information
geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: Conformal symmetries, i.e.\ coordinate transformations that preserve angles,
play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision
and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is
equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift
data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to
exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space
and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact
that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general
geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing
layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient
framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical
physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities,
and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the
trained network.

Conclusion: PhyDA展示了结合生成建模与领域物理知识的重要性，为改进实际数据同化系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by
reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves
as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in
diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing
approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that
govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically
inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework
designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA
introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective
that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing
deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential
equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational
sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's
ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the
ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and
better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with
domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising
direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.

Conclusion: TinyAlign为开发更高效的轻量级VLMs提供了实用方法，并为理解多模态系统对齐瓶颈提供了新视角。

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for
resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision
and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language
model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily
depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be
suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In
this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual
information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model
inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal
inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this
challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context
from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment.
Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces
training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance.
Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only
40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our
work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight
VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and
address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

Motivation: 当前训练算法的鲁棒性不足，且大规模BONNs参数多、计算和功耗高，需要一种高效且鲁棒的优化方法。

Method: 通过剪枝矩阵块和直接优化种群个体，提出了CAP算法，并结合动态噪声影响进行优化。

Result: CAP算法在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上分别剪枝60%和80%参数，性能仅下降3.289%和4.693%，且在噪声环境下表现出最强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAP算法在大规模网络模型和复杂任务中具有显著潜力，同时使用仅含内部相位调制器的MZI可进一步减少系统面积和参数。

Abstract: MZI-based block optical neural networks (BONNs), which can achieve
large-scale network models, have increasingly drawn attentions. However, the
robustness of the current training algorithm is not high enough. Moreover,
large-scale BONNs usually contain numerous trainable parameters, resulting in
expensive computation and power consumption. In this article, by pruning matrix
blocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an
on-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based
pruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs. The calculated results
demonstrate that the CAP algorithm can prune 60% and 80% of the parameters for
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively, while only degrades the
performance by 3.289% and 4.693%. Considering the influence of dynamic noise in
phase shifters, our proposed CAP algorithm (performance degradation of 22.327%
for MNIST dataset and 24.019% for Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing a poor
fabricated chip and electrical control with a standard deviation of 0.5)
exhibits strongest robustness compared with both our previously reported block
adjoint training algorithm (43.963% and 41.074%) and the covariance matrix
adaptation evolution strategy (25.757% and 32.871%), respectively. Moreover,
when 60% of the parameters are pruned, the CAP algorithm realizes 88.5%
accuracy in experiment for the simplified MNIST dataset, which is similar to
the simulation result without noise (92.1%). Additionally, we simulationally
and experimentally demonstrate that using MZIs with only internal phase
shifters to construct BONNs is an efficient way to reduce both the system area
and the required trainable parameters. Notably, our proposed CAP algorithm show
excellent potential for larger-scale network models and more complex tasks.

Abstract: Initialization plays a critical role in Deep Neural Network training,
directly influencing convergence, stability, and generalization. Common
approaches such as Glorot and He initializations rely on randomness, which can
produce uneven weight distributions across layer connections. In this paper, we
introduce the Sinusoidal initialization, a novel deterministic method that
employs sinusoidal functions to construct structured weight matrices expressly
to improve the spread and balance of weights throughout the network while
simultaneously fostering a more uniform, well-conditioned distribution of
neuron activation states from the very first forward pass. Because Sinusoidal
initialization begins with weights and activations that are already evenly and
efficiently utilized, it delivers consistently faster convergence, greater
training stability, and higher final accuracy across a wide range of models,
including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and large
language models. On average, our experiments show an increase of 4.8 % in final
validation accuracy and 20.9 % in convergence speed. By replacing randomness
with structure, this initialization provides a stronger and more reliable
foundation for Deep Learning systems.

SALSA-generated molecules have comparable chemical property profiles to known

Abstract: Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is
crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In
this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more
effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model
performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically
shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture
global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the
raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ
technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network
(TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a
lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world
datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to
linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance
and computational cost. The code is available at:

Conclusion: RGNMR是一种高效且鲁棒的RMC方法，具有理论和实践上的优势。

Abstract: Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may
be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing
RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of
observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed
rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even
mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method,
denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$
is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a
Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On
the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions,
$\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank
matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for
factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several
simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and
in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries,
overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous
domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input
changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a
novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance.
Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a
given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant
generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task
agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency
effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS
dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier
reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method
is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.

Abstract: Operator learning is a rapidly growing field that aims to approximate
nonlinear operators related to partial differential equations (PDEs) using
neural operators. These rely on discretization of input and output functions
and are, usually, expensive to train for large-scale problems at
high-resolution. Motivated by this, we present a Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC)
approach to train neural operators by leveraging a hierarchy of resolutions of
function dicretization. Our framework relies on using gradient corrections from
fewer samples of fine-resolution data to decrease the computational cost of
training while maintaining a high level accuracy. The proposed MLMC training
procedure can be applied to any architecture accepting multi-resolution data.
Our numerical experiments on a range of state-of-the-art models and test-cases
demonstrate improved computational efficiency compared to traditional
single-resolution training approaches, and highlight the existence of a Pareto
curve between accuracy and computational time, related to the number of samples
per resolution.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely
discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and
engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid
dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space
often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several
neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent
space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity,
they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly
sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast,
convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but
are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we
propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized
PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous
convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an
epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution
operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and
irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or
outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements
in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Inference scaling further accelerates Large Language Models (LLMs) toward
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with large-scale Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to unleash long Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Most contemporary reasoning
approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However,
the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves
multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of
manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this
paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL
algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional
regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the
policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling
policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing
exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online
Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward
Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly
affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both
theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO,
including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and
optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of
96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理未标记的野生数据时，模型容易偏向拟合OOD数据，且OOD数据识别阈值选择困难。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证了LoD的可行性和优越性。

Conclusion: LoD框架有效解决了模型偏向拟合OOD数据和阈值选择问题，提升了模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Using unlabeled wild data containing both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) data to improve the safety and reliability of models
has recently received increasing attention. Existing methods either design
customized losses for labeled ID and unlabeled wild data then perform joint
optimization, or first filter out OOD data from the latter then learn an OOD
detector. While achieving varying degrees of success, two potential issues
remain: (i) Labeled ID data typically dominates the learning of models,
inevitably making models tend to fit OOD data as IDs; (ii) The selection of
thresholds for identifying OOD data in unlabeled wild data usually faces
dilemma due to the unavailability of pure OOD samples. To address these issues,
we propose a novel loss-difference OOD detection framework (LoD) by
\textit{intentionally label-noisifying} unlabeled wild data. Such operations
not only enable labeled ID data and OOD data in unlabeled wild data to jointly
dominate the models' learning but also ensure the distinguishability of the
losses between ID and OOD samples in unlabeled wild data, allowing the classic
clustering technique (e.g., K-means) to filter these OOD samples without
requiring thresholds any longer. We also provide theoretical foundation for
LoD's viability, and extensive experiments verify its superiority.

Abstract: Brain-inspired computing aims to mimic cognitive functions like associative
memory, the ability to recall complete patterns from partial cues. Memristor
technology offers promising hardware for such neuromorphic systems due to its
potential for efficient in-memory analog computing. Hopfield Neural Networks
(HNNs) are a classic model for associative memory, but implementations on
conventional hardware suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, while prior
memristor-based HNNs faced challenges with vulnerability to hardware defects
due to offline training, limited storage capacity, and difficulty processing
analog patterns. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate on integrated
memristor hardware a new hardware-adaptive learning algorithm for associative
memories that significantly improves defect tolerance and capacity, and
naturally extends to scalable multilayer architectures capable of handling both
binary and continuous patterns. Our approach achieves 3x effective capacity
under 50% device faults compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, its
extension to multilayer architectures enables superlinear capacity scaling
(\(\propto N^{1.49}\ for binary patterns) and effective recalling of continuous
patterns (\propto N^{1.74}\ scaling), as compared to linear capacity scaling
for previous HNNs. It also provides flexibility to adjust capacity by tuning
hidden neurons for the same-sized patterns. By leveraging the massive
parallelism of the hardware enabled by synchronous updates, it reduces energy
by 8.8x and latency by 99.7% for 64-dimensional patterns over asynchronous
schemes, with greater improvements at scale. This promises the development of
more reliable memristor-based associative memory systems and enables new
applications research due to the significantly improved capacity, efficiency,
and flexibility.

Abstract: This study presents novel Augmented Regression Models using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), where Tracemean features derived from the Neurochaos Learning
framework are integrated with traditional regression algorithms : Linear
Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Support Vector Regression
(SVR). Our approach was evaluated using ten diverse real-life datasets and a
synthetically generated dataset of the form $y = mx + c + \epsilon$. Results
show that incorporating the Tracemean feature (mean of the chaotic neural
traces of the neurons in the NL architecture) significantly enhances regression
performance, particularly in Augmented Lasso Regression and Augmented SVR,
where six out of ten real-life datasets exhibited improved predictive accuracy.
Among the models, Augmented Chaotic Ridge Regression achieved the highest
average performance boost (11.35 %). Additionally, experiments on the simulated
dataset demonstrated that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the augmented models
consistently decreased and converged towards the Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) as the sample size increased. This work demonstrates the potential of
chaos-inspired features in regression tasks, offering a pathway to more
accurate and computationally efficient prediction models.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic
choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their
search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A
prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable
super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm
optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result
in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter
choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control
policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses,
focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling
multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the
problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We
decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art
deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies.
We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a
challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find
policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same
benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive
a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default
theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest
existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem
sizes up to $40{,}000$.

Conclusion: 本文为量化格式设计提供了理论支持，并验证了变量长度编码和最优位宽分配的实际效果。

Abstract: Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training
and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of
quantisation formats is large and the formats are often chosen empirically. In
this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of
quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the
classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of
popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using
variable-length codes. Framing the optimisation problem as minimising the KL
divergence between the original and quantised model outputs, the objective is
aligned with minimising the squared quantisation error of the model parameters.
We therefore develop and evaluate squared-error-optimal formats for known
distributions, observing significant improvement of variable-length codes over
fixed-length codes. Uniform quantisation followed by lossless compression with
a variable-length code is shown to be optimal. However, we find that commonly
used block formats and sparse outlier formats also outperform fixed-length
codes, implying they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using
the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive
the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the
model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when tested with
direct-cast quantisation of language models.

Motivation: 现有的CoT及其扩展方法虽然能提升推理准确性，但令牌成本高，难以在延迟敏感场景中部署。因此，需要一种更高效的推理策略。

Method: 提出Fractured Sampling，通过三个正交维度（推理轨迹数量、每个轨迹的最终解数量、推理截断深度）在完整CoT和仅生成解之间插值。

Result: 在五个推理基准和多个模型规模上，Fractured Sampling显著提升了Pass@k与令牌预算的权衡，实现了对数线性增益。

Conclusion: Fractured Sampling为高效且可扩展的LLM推理提供了新方向，优化了计算资源分配。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional
computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy
by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches
incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive
settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning
before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full
CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight,
we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that
interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal
axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final
solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are
truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks
and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently
achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling
gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate
computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for
more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deep generative models are promising tools for science and engineering, but
their reliance on abundant, high-quality data limits applicability. We present
a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability
distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to
supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach
is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed
function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational
autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder
within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE
training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that
yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints
when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two
challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse
sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect
measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant
improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and
enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is
intractable without constraints.

Conclusion: LiBOG为Meta-BBO提供了一种实用的终身学习范式，解决了现实场景中的动态问题分布挑战。

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) garners attention due to its success in
automating the configuration and generation of black-box optimizers,
significantly reducing the human effort required for optimizer design and
discovering optimizers with higher performance than classic human-designed
optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO methods conduct one-off training under
the assumption that a stationary problem distribution with extensive and
representative training problem samples is pre-available. This assumption is
often impractical in real-world scenarios, where diverse problems following
shifting distribution continually arise. Consequently, there is a pressing need
for methods that can continuously learn from new problems encountered
on-the-fly and progressively enhance their capabilities. In this work, we
explore a novel paradigm of lifelong learning in MetaBBO and introduce LiBOG, a
novel approach designed to learn from sequentially encountered problems and
generate high-performance optimizers for Black-Box Optimization (BBO). LiBOG
consolidates knowledge both across tasks and within tasks to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate LiBOG's
effectiveness in learning to generate high-performance optimizers in a lifelong
learning manner, addressing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining
plasticity to learn new tasks.

Conclusion: SASR通过动态平衡SFT和RL，有效提升模型推理能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical
problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are
respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to
mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training
schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization
across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to
these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human
reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training
framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the
two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish
basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm
based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to
seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the
training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR
ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core
reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results
demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

Conclusion: 明确内容-相对位置混合是有效PE设计的关键原则，为Transformer中位置结构整合提供了新见解。

Abstract: Positional encoding (PE) is essential for enabling Transformers to model
sequential structure. However, the mechanisms by which different PE schemes
couple token content and positional information-and how these mechanisms
influence model dynamics-remain theoretically underexplored. In this work, we
present a unified framework that analyzes PE through the spectral properties of
Toeplitz and related matrices derived from attention logits. We show that
multiplicative content-position coupling-exemplified by Rotary Positional
Encoding (RoPE) via a Hadamard product with a Toeplitz matrix-induces spectral
contraction, which theoretically improves optimization stability and
efficiency. Guided by this theory, we construct synthetic tasks that contrast
content-position dependent and content-position independent settings, and
evaluate a range of PE methods. Our experiments reveal strong alignment with
theory: RoPE consistently outperforms other methods on position-sensitive tasks
and induces "single-head deposit" patterns in early layers, indicating
localized positional processing. Further analyses show that modifying the
method and timing of PE coupling, such as MLA in Deepseek-V3, can effectively
mitigate this concentration. These results establish explicit content-relative
mixing with relative-position Toeplitz signals as a key principle for effective
PE design and provide new insight into how positional structure is integrated
in Transformer architectures.

learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals.
This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both
detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic
embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic
embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is
important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens,
a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also
introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from
multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary
model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves
zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task
innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains:
5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly
detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series
retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters,
making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency
enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for
efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic flow parameters and real time identification
of congestion states are essential for the efficient operation of intelligent
transportation systems. This paper proposes a Periodic Pattern Transformer
Network (PPTNet) for traffic flow prediction, integrating periodic pattern
extraction with the Transformer architecture, coupled with a fuzzy inference
method for real-time congestion identification. Firstly, a high-precision
traffic flow dataset (Traffic Flow Dataset for China's Congested Highways and
Expressways, TF4CHE) suitable for congested highway scenarios in China is
constructed based on drone aerial imagery data. Subsequently, the proposed
PPTNet employs Fast Fourier Transform to capture multi-scale periodic patterns
and utilizes two-dimensional Inception convolutions to efficiently extract
intra and inter periodic features. A Transformer decoder dynamically models
temporal dependencies, enabling accurate predictions of traffic density and
speed. Finally, congestion probabilities are calculated in real-time using the
predicted outcomes via a Mamdani fuzzy inference-based congestion
identification module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
PPTNet significantly outperforms mainstream traffic prediction methods in
prediction accuracy, and the congestion identification module effectively
identifies real-time road congestion states, verifying the superiority and
practicality of the proposed method in real-world traffic scenarios. Project

Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate
complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models
like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent
advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising
the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal
computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful
paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually
designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to
develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient
descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and
training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal
computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful
training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix
multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural
network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the
cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward
realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding
universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated
discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自动选择混合精度配置的方法，通过泰勒展开和整数规划优化推理时间和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络时，降低位宽会牺牲准确性，混合精度通过动态调整不同层的精度来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于泰勒展开的敏感度度量，结合硬件感知的时间增益预测，通过整数规划选择最优配置。

Result: 在Intel Gaudi 2加速器上验证了该方法对大型语言模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for Neural Network (NN) compression, reducing model
size and computational demands by using lower bit-width data types, though
aggressive reduction often hampers accuracy. Mixed Precision (MP) mitigates
this tradeoff by varying the numerical precision across network layers. This
study focuses on automatically selecting an optimal MP configuration within
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for inference. The first key contribution is a
novel sensitivity metric derived from a first-order Taylor series expansion of
the loss function as a function of quantization errors in weights and
activations. This metric, based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the loss, is
efficiently calculated per layer using high-precision forward and backward
passes over a small calibration dataset. The metric is additive across layers,
with low calibration memory overhead as weight optimization is unnecessary. The
second contribution is an accurate hardware-aware method for predicting MP time
gain by modeling it as additive for sequential sub-graphs. An algorithm
partitions the model graph into sequential subgraphs, measuring time gain for
each configuration using a few samples. After calibrating per-layer sensitivity
and time gain, an Integer Programming (IP) problem is formulated to maximize
time gain while keeping loss MSE below a set threshold. Memory gain and
theoretical time gain based on Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations are
also considered. Rigorous experiments on the Intel Gaudi 2 accelerator validate
the approach on several Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Jie Yan,Xin Liu,Zhong-Yuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniFC是一个模型无关的联邦聚类框架，通过编码数据共享保护隐私，并解决非独立同分布数据带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦聚类需要在不共享原始数据的情况下发现全局聚类结构，但现有方法因数据异构性和模型特定性而受限。

Method: 利用Lagrange编码计算，客户端仅共享编码数据，精确重构全局距离矩阵，同时保护隐私。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，OmniFC在鲁棒性、有效性和通用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniFC提供了一个统一的框架，适用于多种集中式聚类方法，并具有隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Federated clustering (FC) aims to discover global cluster structures across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, making privacy preservation a
fundamental requirement. There are two critical challenges: (1) privacy leakage
during collaboration, and (2) robustness degradation due to aggregation of
proxy information from non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID)
local data, leading to inaccurate or inconsistent global clustering. Existing
solutions typically rely on model-specific local proxies, which are sensitive
to data heterogeneity and inherit inductive biases from their centralized
counterparts, thus limiting robustness and generality. We propose Omni
Federated Clustering (OmniFC), a unified and model-agnostic framework.
Leveraging Lagrange coded computing, our method enables clients to share only
encoded data, allowing exact reconstruction of the global distance matrix--a
fundamental representation of sample relationships--without leaking private
information, even under client collusion. This construction is naturally
resilient to Non-IID data distributions. This approach decouples FC from
model-specific proxies, providing a unified extension mechanism applicable to
diverse centralized clustering methods. Theoretical analysis confirms both
reconstruction fidelity and privacy guarantees, while comprehensive experiments
demonstrate OmniFC's superior robustness, effectiveness, and generality across
various benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正交生存学习工具箱，用于在生存分析中估计异质性处理效应（HTEs），具有理论保证、灵活权重函数和模型无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生存分析中，由于时间到事件数据的截断性，估计异质性处理效应具有挑战性，需要更稳健的方法。

Method: 开发了一个包含多种正交生存学习器的工具箱，支持自定义权重函数，并与任意机器学习模型结合。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了学习器在不同低重叠情况下的有效性，包括生存重叠和截断重叠。

Conclusion: 为实践者提供了一个适用于随机和观察性研究的工具箱，支持截断时间到事件数据的HTE估计。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for personalized
decision-making. However, this task is challenging in survival analysis, which
includes time-to-event data with censored outcomes (e.g., due to study
dropout). In this paper, we propose a toolbox of novel orthogonal survival
learners to estimate HTEs from time-to-event data under censoring. Our learners
have three main advantages: (i) we show that learners from our toolbox are
guaranteed to be orthogonal and thus come with favorable theoretical
properties; (ii) our toolbox allows for incorporating a custom weighting
function, which can lead to robustness against different types of low overlap,
and (iii) our learners are model-agnostic (i.e., they can be combined with
arbitrary machine learning models). We instantiate the learners from our
toolbox using several weighting functions and, as a result, propose various
neural orthogonal survival learners. Some of these coincide with existing
survival learners (including survival versions of the DR- and R-learner), while
others are novel and further robust w.r.t. low overlap regimes specific to the
survival setting (i.e., survival overlap and censoring overlap). We then
empirically verify the effectiveness of our learners for HTE estimation in
different low-overlap regimes through numerical experiments. In sum, we provide
practitioners with a large toolbox of learners that can be used for randomized
and observational studies with censored time-to-event data.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决MLLMs在非平稳RFT过程中由于概念漂移导致的推理偏差问题。

Method: 方法包括将CoT的自回归令牌流形式化为非平稳分布，并提出CPO方法，通过概念图驱动的LLM专家生成反事实推理轨迹，实现稳定RFT。

Result: 实验表明CPO在鲁棒性、泛化性和协调性方面表现优异，并贡献了大规模数据集CXR-CounterFact（CCF）。

Conclusion: 结论是CPO能有效解决非平稳RFT中的概念漂移问题，并在医学领域展示了显著效果。

Abstract: This paper uncovers a critical yet overlooked phenomenon in multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs): detrimental concept drift within chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning during non-stationary reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where
reasoning token distributions evolve unpredictably, thereby introducing
significant biases in final predictions. To address this, we are pioneers in
establishing the theoretical bridge between concept drift theory and RFT
processes by formalizing CoT's autoregressive token streams as non-stationary
distributions undergoing arbitrary temporal shifts. Leveraging this framework,
we propose a novel counterfact-aware RFT that systematically decouples
beneficial distribution adaptation from harmful concept drift through concept
graph-empowered LLM experts generating counterfactual reasoning trajectories.
Our solution, Counterfactual Preference Optimization (CPO), enables stable RFT
in non-stationary environments, particularly within the medical domain, through
custom-tuning of counterfactual-aware preference alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our superior performance of robustness, generalization
and coordination within RFT. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset
CXR-CounterFact (CCF), comprising 320,416 meticulously curated counterfactual
reasoning trajectories derived from MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public.

Abstract: We propose a novel benchmarking methodology for graph neural networks (GNNs)
based on the graph alignment problem, a combinatorial optimization task that
generalizes graph isomorphism by aligning two unlabeled graphs to maximize
overlapping edges. We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and
present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic
random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given
graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing
difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our
experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard
convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph
alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training,
where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on
three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the
PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support
reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package
to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于两阶段CATE估计器的最优决策问题，发现其可能对决策不理想，并提出了一种新的学习目标和神经网络方法以优化决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中常用CATE估计器做决策，但其决策性能缺乏理论支持，尤其是两阶段CATE估计器可能不适合决策。

Method: 提出了一种新的两阶段学习目标，平衡CATE估计误差和决策性能，并设计了一种神经网络方法优化目标。

Result: 理论和实验验证了新方法的有效性，首次展示了两阶段CATE估计器如何适应最优决策。

Conclusion: 两阶段CATE估计器需针对决策优化，新方法为此提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Decision-making across various fields, such as medicine, heavily relies on
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). Practitioners commonly make
decisions by checking whether the estimated CATE is positive, even though the
decision-making performance of modern CATE estimators is poorly understood from
a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study optimal decision-making
based on two-stage CATE estimators (e.g., DR-learner), which are considered
state-of-the-art and widely used in practice. We prove that, while such
estimators may be optimal for estimating CATE, they can be suboptimal when used
for decision-making. Intuitively, this occurs because such estimators
prioritize CATE accuracy in regions far away from the decision boundary, which
is ultimately irrelevant to decision-making. As a remedy, we propose a novel
two-stage learning objective that retargets the CATE to balance CATE estimation
error and decision performance. We then propose a neural method that optimizes
an adaptively-smoothed approximation of our learning objective. Finally, we
confirm the effectiveness of our method both empirically and theoretically. In
sum, our work is the first to show how two-stage CATE estimators can be adapted
for optimal decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显著性方法在时间序列分析中效果有限，因为语义特征常存在于其他域（如频域）。论文旨在通过跨域积分梯度方法提供更丰富的解释性。

Method: 提出了跨域积分梯度方法，支持任何可逆、可微变换的域上的特征归因，并扩展到复数域以实现频域归因。

Result: 在心率提取、癫痫检测和时间序列预测三个任务中，该方法能捕捉传统方法无法发现的语义特征。

Conclusion: 跨域积分梯度方法为时间序列模型提供了更丰富的解释性，弥补了传统方法的不足，并开源了实现库。

Abstract: Traditional saliency map methods, popularized in computer vision, highlight
individual points (pixels) of the input that contribute the most to the model's
output. However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically
meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain
Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method
enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an
invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our
derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain,
enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical
guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals
interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot
capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction,
electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable
plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results
demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide
semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with
traditional time-domain saliency.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少参数量的同时，实现了与现有最优方案相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: 通过展开优化算法并结合图学习模块，提出了一种高效且可解释的交通预测方法。

Abstract: To forecast traffic with both spatial and temporal dimensions, we unroll a
mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm into a lightweight and interpretable
transformer-like neural net. Specifically, we construct two graphs: an
undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across
geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential
relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future
samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both
$\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and
$\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness
(low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative
algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and
unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We
insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which
are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments
show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast
performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter
counts drastically. Our code is available in

Result: FreeKV在多种场景和模型中实现接近无损的准确性，速度比现有KV检索方法快13倍。

Conclusion: FreeKV通过算法和系统优化，有效解决了长上下文部署中的KV缓存问题，显著提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding
context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long
contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache
whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression
methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur
considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant
efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization
framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the
algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV
selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with
fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs
hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data
transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve
efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy
across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup
compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏（KD）在生成模型（如大语言模型）中通过权衡精度与召回率提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KD的实证效果显著，但其在生成模型中的工作机制尚不明确，本文旨在提供一种最小化解释。

Method: 通过高斯混合模拟和大规模语言模型实验，分析KD如何影响生成模型的精度与召回率。

Result: KD导致学生模型在精度（样本质量）与召回率（分布覆盖）之间权衡，尤其在样本质量优先的场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: KD在生成模型中的有效性可通过精度-召回率权衡解释，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and
deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models
(LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented--enabling smaller
student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers--the
underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly
understood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in
generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians,
we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and
recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more
selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood
regions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single
entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale
language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results
reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where
precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage.
This precision-recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where
sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream
generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the
effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在在线数据流中的应用增加，算法的公平性成为伦理和法律关注的重点。同时，类别不平衡也需要处理以确保预测性能。现有方法通常单独处理这些问题，而C-SMOTE方法在解决类别不平衡时可能引入算法偏差。

Method: CFSMOTE是一种公平感知的连续SMOTE变体，通过情境测试和在过采样过程中平衡公平相关群体，同时解决类别不平衡和公平性问题。

Result: 实验表明，CFSMOTE在多个常见群体公平性指标上显著优于普通C-SMOTE，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFSMOTE提供了一种有效的方法，无需仅优化单一公平性指标，从而避免了潜在的权衡问题。

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly applied in an online fashion to deal with
evolving data streams, the fairness of these algorithms is a matter of growing
ethical and legal concern. In many use cases, class imbalance in the data also
needs to be dealt with to ensure predictive performance. Current fairness-aware
stream learners typically attempt to solve these issues through in- or
post-processing by focusing on optimizing one specific discrimination metric,
addressing class imbalance in a separate processing step. While C-SMOTE is a
highly effective model-agnostic pre-processing approach to mitigate class
imbalance, as a side effect of this method, algorithmic bias is often
introduced.
  Therefore, we propose CFSMOTE - a fairness-aware, continuous SMOTE variant -
as a pre-processing approach to simultaneously address the class imbalance and
fairness concerns by employing situation testing and balancing
fairness-relevant groups during oversampling. Unlike other fairness-aware
stream learners, CFSMOTE is not optimizing for only one specific fairness
metric, therefore avoiding potentially problematic trade-offs. Our experiments
show significant improvement on several common group fairness metrics in
comparison to vanilla C-SMOTE while maintaining competitive performance, also
in comparison to other fairness-aware algorithms.

Result: 发现了三个关键结果：(i) 全数据预测器与刻板预测器的接近性，(ii) 训练模型倾向于仅学习多数特征的区域主导性，(iii) 额外训练需求的下界。

Conclusion: 通过深度学习的实验验证了结果，表明偏见放大问题在理论和实践中均存在。

Abstract: Despite growing empirical evidence of bias amplification in machine learning,
its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. We develop a formal
framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training
can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect
minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our
analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between
``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region
where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and
(iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are
illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image
classification tasks.

Result: μPC成功训练了128层残差网络，在简单分类任务中表现优异，且支持权重和学习率的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: μPC为局部算法提供了新思路，可扩展至卷积和Transformer架构，代码已开源。

Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many
alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local
information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation.
However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep
networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings.
Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for
the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can
be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023;
Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis
of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make
standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite
addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of
very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks
with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks.
Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity
learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for
other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer
architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for
PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).

TL;DR: NeSyDMs通过离散扩散建模符号间依赖关系，解决了传统神经符号预测器中的独立性假设问题，提升了预测准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经符号预测器假设符号间独立，导致无法建模交互和不确定性，影响预测置信度和泛化能力。

Method: 提出神经符号扩散模型（NeSyDMs），利用离散扩散过程建模符号依赖关系，同时保留独立性假设以实现可扩展学习。

Result: 在合成和真实世界任务（如视觉路径规划和自动驾驶）中，NeSyDMs在神经符号预测器中达到最优准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: NeSyDMs通过建模符号依赖关系，显著提升了神经符号预测器的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic
reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy
predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract,
thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often
leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution
generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we
introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy
predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols.
Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each
step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing
symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and
rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among
NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了带有归一化层的深度神经网络的通用逼近定理（UAT），证明了仅由并行层归一化（PLN）和线性层组成的无限宽网络具有通用逼近能力，并探讨了单隐藏层网络逼近L-Lipchitz连续函数所需的最小神经元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UAT分析仅基于线性和非线性激活函数，忽略了现代网络中常用的归一化层。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究归一化层对DNN逼近能力的影响。

Method: 通过理论证明，研究了仅由并行层归一化（PLN）和线性层组成的无限宽网络的逼近能力，并比较了PLN与传统激活函数的性能。

Result: PLN不仅具有通用逼近能力，还能同时作为激活函数和归一化层使用。实验表明，PLN在Transformer架构中替换LN能提升性能。

Conclusion: PLN在理论和实践中均表现出优越性，为神经网络架构设计提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Universal approximation theorem (UAT) is a fundamental theory for deep neural
networks (DNNs), demonstrating their powerful representation capacity to
represent and approximate any function. The analyses and proofs of UAT are
based on traditional network with only linear and nonlinear activation
functions, but omitting normalization layers, which are commonly employed to
enhance the training of modern networks. This paper conducts research on UAT of
DNNs with normalization layers for the first time. We theoretically prove that
an infinitely wide network -- composed solely of parallel layer normalization
(PLN) and linear layers -- has universal approximation capacity. Additionally,
we investigate the minimum number of neurons required to approximate
$L$-Lipchitz continuous functions, with a single hidden-layer network. We
compare the approximation capacity of PLN with traditional activation functions
in theory. Different from the traditional activation functions, we identify
that PLN can act as both activation function and normalization in deep neural
networks at the same time. We also find that PLN can improve the performance
when replacing LN in transformer architectures, which reveals the potential of
PLN used in neural architectures.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在固定数据集上提取高性能策略时，常因分布外样本导致性能下降。现有离线模型强化学习方法在稀疏奖励和长时程任务中表现不佳。

Method: TempDATA框架在潜在空间中生成时间结构化的增强转换，通过学习捕捉状态空间中轨迹和转换级别的时间距离的潜在抽象。

Result: 实验表明，TempDATA在D4RL AntMaze等任务中优于现有离线模型强化学习方法，性能与扩散基轨迹增强和目标条件强化学习相当或更优。

Conclusion: TempDATA通过潜在空间的时间结构化增强转换，显著提升了离线模型强化学习在稀疏奖励和长时程任务中的性能。

Abstract: The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a
high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance
degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL
(MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching
state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics
model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in
sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL
framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA),
that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space
rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns
a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and
transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA
outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing
the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned
RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Forward-Backward表示方法，通过引入基于Transformer的信念估计器和动态特定策略编码空间分区，解决了行为基础模型在动态变化环境中的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基础模型（BFMs）在零样本任务中表现出色，但在动态变化环境下表现不佳，限制了其在现实场景（如机器人技术）中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种结合Transformer信念估计器的FB模型，并将策略编码空间分区为动态特定簇，以提高对动态变化的适应能力。

Result: 在动态变化环境中，该方法在零样本任务中的表现比基线方法提高了2倍。

Conclusion: 改进的FB模型能够有效适应训练中观察到的动态变化，并泛化到未见过的动态环境，提升了行为基础模型的实用性。

Abstract: Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) proved successful in producing policies
for arbitrary tasks in a zero-shot manner, requiring no test-time training or
task-specific fine-tuning. Among the most promising BFMs are the ones that
estimate the successor measure learned in an unsupervised way from
task-agnostic offline data. However, these methods fail to react to changes in
the dynamics, making them inefficient under partial observability or when the
transition function changes. This hinders the applicability of BFMs in a
real-world setting, e.g., in robotics, where the dynamics can unexpectedly
change at test time. In this work, we demonstrate that Forward-Backward (FB)
representation, one of the methods from the BFM family, cannot distinguish
between distinct dynamics, leading to an interference among the latent
directions, which parametrize different policies. To address this, we propose a
FB model with a transformer-based belief estimator, which greatly facilitates
zero-shot adaptation. We also show that partitioning the policy encoding space
into dynamics-specific clusters, aligned with the context-embedding directions,
yields additional gain in performance. These traits allow our method to respond
to the dynamics observed during training and to generalize to unseen ones.
Empirically, in the changing dynamics setting, our approach achieves up to a 2x
higher zero-shot returns compared to the baselines for both discrete and
continuous tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出RIFLES方法，通过预测客户端可用性优化联邦学习中的客户端选择，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的客户端选择策略短视，导致效率低下，RIFLES旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RIFLES通过CNN-LSTM模型预测客户端可用性，提出自适应选择策略，将问题转化为调度问题。

Result: 实验显示RIFLES在准确性和测试损失等指标上提升10%-50%。

Conclusion: RIFLES首次将联邦学习视为调度问题，显著优化了客户端选择效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that allows decentralized collaborative model training across a set of
distributed clients, by avoiding raw data exchange. A fundamental component of
FL is the selection of a subset of clients in each round for model training by
a central server. Current selection strategies are myopic in nature in that
they are based on past or current interactions, often leading to inefficiency
issues such as straggling clients. In this paper, we address this serious
shortcoming by proposing the RIFLES approach that builds a novel availability
forecasting layer to support the client selection process. We make the
following contributions: (i) we formalise the sequential selection problem and
reduce it to a scheduling problem and show that the problem is NP-complete,
(ii) leveraging heartbeat messages from clients, RIFLES build an availability
prediction layer to support (long term) selection decisions, (iii) we propose a
novel adaptive selection strategy to support efficient learning and resource
usage. To circumvent the inherent exponential complexity, we present RIFLES, a
heuristic that leverages clients' historical availability data by using a
CNN-LSTM time series forecasting model, allowing the server to predict the
optimal participation times of clients, thereby enabling informed selection
decisions. By comparing against other FL techniques, we show that RIFLES
provide significant improvement by between 10%-50% on a variety of metrics such
as accuracy and test loss. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work
to investigate FL as a scheduling problem.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的模型EMDP-GA，用于处理AI代理在未知未知状态下的问题，通过非信息价值扩展（NIVE）方法初始化新发现状态的价值函数，并证明了其性能与现有技术相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理在强化学习中遇到未知未知状态时缺乏处理能力的问题。

Method: 提出EMDP-GA模型，采用NIVE方法扩展价值函数，并结合上置信界动量Q学习进行训练。

Result: 证明了方法的遗憾与现有技术一致，计算和空间复杂度也相当。

Conclusion: 未知未知状态可以被有效且高效地处理。

Abstract: An AI agent might surprisingly find she has reached an unknown state which
she has never been aware of -- an unknown unknown. We mathematically ground
this scenario in reinforcement learning: an agent, after taking an action
calculated from value functions $Q$ and $V$ defined on the {\it {aware
domain}}, reaches a state out of the domain. To enable the agent to handle this
scenario, we propose an {\it episodic Markov decision {process} with growing
awareness} (EMDP-GA) model, taking a new {\it noninformative value expansion}
(NIVE) approach to expand value functions to newly aware areas: when an agent
arrives at an unknown unknown, value functions $Q$ and $V$ whereon are
initialised by noninformative beliefs -- the averaged values on the aware
domain. This design is out of respect for the complete absence of knowledge in
the newly discovered state. The upper confidence bound momentum Q-learning is
then adapted to the growing awareness for training the EMDP-GA model. We prove
that (1) the regret of our approach is asymptotically consistent with the state
of the art (SOTA) without exposure to unknown unknowns in an extremely
uncertain environment, and (2) our computational complexity and space
complexity are comparable with the SOTA -- these collectively suggest that
though an unknown unknown is surprising, it will be asymptotically properly
discovered with decent speed and an affordable cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在训练规模定律下性能有所提升，但在推理能力上仍面临挑战，如灾难性遗忘和新训练数据不足。测试时扩展成为替代方案。

Method: 提出LatentSeek框架，利用策略梯度在潜在空间中迭代更新表示，通过自生成奖励信号引导。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME2024等基准测试中，LatentSeek表现优于Chain-of-Thought提示和微调方法，且高效收敛。

Conclusion: LatentSeek是一种轻量级、可扩展且有效的解决方案，展示了潜在空间测试时扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose
a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI.
Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law,
significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training
algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of
novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning
performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating.
Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose
leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to
the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that
enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA)
within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy
gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated
reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks,
including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures.
Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our
analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging
within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also
benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of
test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a
lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 动态系统重建（DSR）需要从观测数据推断生成模型，但现有方法缺乏零样本和上下文推理能力。DynaMix旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DynaMix采用多变量ALRNN混合专家架构，通过预训练实现零样本泛化，无需对新系统进行重新训练。

Result: DynaMix在长期统计和短期预测上优于现有时间序列模型，且参数更少、推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于动态系统原理的模型（如DynaMix）在时间序列预测领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are
governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer
generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their
long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any
new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference
capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate
ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR
model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided
context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the
long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation
models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and
orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation
models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts,
even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used
for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training
corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems,
and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also
for advancing the TS prediction field.

Motivation: 解决Adam等优化器在训练中因自适应稳定性边缘导致的振荡和收敛缓慢问题。

Method: 引入基于速度的高阶惩罚项，动态调整学习率，结合Adam的逐参数缩放，形成混合优化器。

Result: VRAdam在图像分类、语言建模等任务中表现优于AdamW等标准优化器。

Conclusion: VRAdam通过速度正则化有效提升训练稳定性和性能。

Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer
for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for
kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics.
Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called
adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations
and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on
the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically
slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that
the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping
oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary
without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global
damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we
demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard
optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image
classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling
using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.

Motivation: 时间分辨单细胞组学数据为细胞命运提供了高通量、全基因组的测量，但技术本身的破坏性和细胞动态变化（如分裂、死亡）使得推断真实的生物物理模型具有挑战性。

Result: 在模拟和真实单细胞RNA-seq数据集上的评估表明，该方法比现有方法具有更高的准确性，且训练过程简单。

Conclusion: 不平衡概率流推断为从破坏性测量中推断生物物理模型提供了一种有效且准确的方法。

Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide
measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the
processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive,
allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic
dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing
their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to
inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach,
\emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for
biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging
a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately
disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the
applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and
real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we
find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step
training scheme.

Result: MDL原则能有效选择完美解而非近似解，且不受优化算法影响。

Conclusion: MDL原则提供了更优的归纳偏置，能有效抑制过拟合并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable
solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic,
perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We
show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when
trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or
none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions
but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast,
applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model
complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization
method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations,
independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing
regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to
effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注模型性能与资源增长的渐近关系或最优训练时间，而忽略了训练动态的丰富性。本文旨在通过谱复杂度范数分析整个训练过程，揭示更全面的性能演化规律。

Method: 通过分析卷积神经网络（CNN）、残差网络（ResNet）和视觉变换器（Vision Transformer）在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的训练动态，结合单层感知器的理论模型，研究谱复杂度的增长与泛化行为的关系。

Result: 发现了两条新的动态标度律，能够解释性能在训练过程中的演化，并统一了收敛时的测试误差标度律。结果在多种架构和数据集上一致，理论模型也支持这一发现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅扩展了对深度学习标度律的理解，还为泛化能力的涌现提供了机制性解释，对模型设计和优化具有指导意义。

Abstract: Scaling laws in deep learning - empirical power-law relationships linking
model performance to resource growth - have emerged as simple yet striking
regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are
particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since
they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the
foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies
focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training
time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by
analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity
norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance
evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error
scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization
emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision
Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide
analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained
with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral
complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior
observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to
classical learning rules in the perceptron.

Conclusion: 多目标优化方法在复杂PIML场景中具有显著优势，为PIML提供了新范式。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow
modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven
approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically
incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven
loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a
trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model
predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is
limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats
data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML
loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable
trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two
loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by
reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem,
treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several
multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient
descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto
front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both
macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs
achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods.
Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their
scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.

Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has
become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this
paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing
memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a
unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states
using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing
weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize
memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from
bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to
quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete
weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization
and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized
Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous
quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative
clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based
and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to
full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by
more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Residual-Noise Fingerprinting (RN-F)的新方法，用于检测大型语言模型（LLMs）中的数据污染问题，其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染（测试数据与训练数据重叠）影响了LLMs应用的可靠性，现有方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: RN-F是一种单次、无梯度的检测方法，利用残差信号模式，无需额外浮点运算。

Result: 在多个LLMs和污染数据集上的实验表明，RN-F在污染检测指标上比现有方法提升高达10.5%。

Conclusion: RN-F是一种轻量级、模型无关且高效的数据污染检测框架，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational in modern artificial
intelligence, powering a wide range of applications from code generation and
virtual assistants to scientific research and enterprise automation. However,
concerns about data contamination--where test data overlaps with training
data--have raised serious questions about the reliability of these
applications. Despite awareness of this issue, existing methods fall short in
effectively identifying or mitigating contamination. In this paper, we propose
Residual-Noise Fingerprinting (RN-F), a novel framework for detecting
contaminated data in LLMs. RN-F is a single-pass, gradient-free detection
method that leverages residual signal patterns without introducing additional
floating-point operations. Our approach is lightweight, model-agnostic, and
efficient. We evaluate RN-F on multiple LLMs across various contaminated
datasets and show that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving performance improvements of up to 10.5% in contamination
detection metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅优化固定令牌预算下的最终性能，导致训练和部署效率低下，需改进。

Method: 截断完整思考过程以适应采样令牌预算，引入密集奖励，分离优化思考和总结策略，并采用BRPO技术。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AnytimeReasoner优于GRPO，提升训练和令牌效率。

Conclusion: AnytimeReasoner框架有效提升推理效率和灵活性，适用于动态令牌预算场景。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end
of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance
under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to
optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency
and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To
achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled
token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the
optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces
verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more
effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking
and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward.
Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget
Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency
of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results
in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions,
enhancing both training and token efficiency.

Abstract: Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant
computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address
climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches
for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that
incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a
continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple
mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity
reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these
models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We
benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference
generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic
interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate
policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection
significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when
modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological
advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions,
allowing for better representation of technology transitions and
uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in
the face of climate change.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经网络架构Neural Functional，用于学习函数到标量的映射，并展示了其在PDE替代模型中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，神经PDE替代模型的架构多基于神经网络或算子学习，但缺乏对函数到标量映射的学习能力。

Method: 结合算子学习和神经场的见解，提出Neural Functional架构，能够隐式学习泛函导数。

Result: 在1D和2D PDE中，Hamiltonian Neural Functional表现出更好的稳定性和能量守恒性。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅适用于PDE，还可能应用于分子动力学或设计优化等领域。

Abstract: Many architectures for neural PDE surrogates have been proposed in recent
years, largely based on neural networks or operator learning. In this work, we
derive and propose a new architecture, the Neural Functional, which learns
function to scalar mappings. Its implementation leverages insights from
operator learning and neural fields, and we show the ability of neural
functionals to implicitly learn functional derivatives. For the first time,
this allows for an extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to neural PDE surrogates
by learning the Hamiltonian functional and optimizing its functional
derivatives. We demonstrate that the Hamiltonian Neural Functional can be an
effective surrogate model through improved stability and conserving energy-like
quantities on 1D and 2D PDEs. Beyond PDEs, functionals are prevalent in
physics; functional approximation and learning with its gradients may find
other uses, such as in molecular dynamics or design optimization.

TL;DR: FlowPure是一种基于连续归一化流（CNFs）的新型对抗净化方法，利用条件流匹配（CFM）训练，优于现有扩散模型方法，并在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 对抗鲁棒性是机器学习系统的重要挑战，现有基于扩散模型的净化方法依赖固定噪声过程，FlowPure旨在通过灵活利用攻击知识提升鲁棒性。

Method: FlowPure使用CNFs和CFM训练，从对抗样本映射到干净样本，支持特定攻击知识的优化和通用高斯扰动训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，FlowPure在预处理盲盒和白盒场景中优于现有方法，且不损害良性样本准确率，还能高效检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: FlowPure不仅是一种高效的净化方法，还具有对抗检测潜力，为对抗防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains
a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal
of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial
purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this,
state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise
during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a
denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we
propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing
Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings
from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior
diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can
leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats,
while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian
perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and
can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our
results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also
holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying
preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据通常具有未知或近似对称性，而现有等变网络需预先固定变换群（如连续SO(2)旋转），导致性能下降。

Method: RECON利用类-姿态分解和数据驱动归一化，将任意参考系对齐到共同的自然姿态，生成可比较和可解释的对称性描述符。

Result: 在2D图像基准测试中有效发现对称性，并首次扩展到3D变换群。

Conclusion: RECON为更灵活的等变建模铺平了道路。

Abstract: Real-world data often exhibits unknown or approximate symmetries, yet
existing equivariant networks must commit to a fixed transformation group prior
to training, e.g., continuous $SO(2)$ rotations. This mismatch degrades
performance when the actual data symmetries differ from those in the
transformation group. We introduce RECON, a framework to discover each input's
intrinsic symmetry distribution from unlabeled data. RECON leverages class-pose
decompositions and applies a data-driven normalization to align arbitrary
reference frames into a common natural pose, yielding directly comparable and
interpretable symmetry descriptors. We demonstrate effective symmetry discovery
on 2D image benchmarks and -- for the first time -- extend it to 3D
transformation groups, paving the way towards more flexible equivariant
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏可扩展性，且仅关注模型构建，未能全面评估机器学习工程实践中的多样化能力。

Method: 框架通过整合多领域任务和多样化挑战（如数据处理、代码翻译等），并支持多种研究产物的评估（如文件、代码、模型），结合数值和LLM评估方法。

Result: TimeSeriesGym不仅适用于时间序列应用，还可扩展到其他数据类型，提升了AI代理评估的全面性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架开源，旨在促进未来对AI代理机器学习工程能力的研究。

Abstract: We introduce TimeSeriesGym, a scalable benchmarking framework for evaluating
Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents on time series machine learning engineering
challenges. Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model
building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research
artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more
relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales
along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering
requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from
diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to
evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding
research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather
than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support
designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation
mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code,
and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based
evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with
contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications,
our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly
enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation.
We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the
ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.

Result: 在2D泊松方程基准测试中，L2平方误差显著降低，计算效率大幅提升。

Conclusion: KHRONOS在边缘计算、在线控制和计算机视觉等领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by
the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS
(Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an
AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS
constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical
composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes
and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation
benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L2 square
errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-10. This represents a 100 time gain over Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs
with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters.
This also represents a 1e4 times improvement in L2 square error compared to
standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by
inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to
an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid,
iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with
sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS scalability, expressivity, and
interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online
control, computer vision, and beyond.

Motivation: 研究在标签数据稀缺时，应选择利用未标记数据（SSL）还是预训练模型（如VLMs）。

Method: 提出Few-shot SSL框架，公平比较两种范式，控制标签数据量。

Result: 预训练VLMs在大多数情况下优于SSL方法，除非数据质量差。

Conclusion: 建议未来SSL研究与预训练模型比较并探索更深层次整合，如利用预训练知识增强伪标签。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process
by exploiting unlabeled data, and has achieved promising results on various
tasks such as image classification. Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm
has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained
models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks.
Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce
in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?}
To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as
representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL}
-- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by
controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across
various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL
methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks
clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to
compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using
pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research,
we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework. Codes are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SART框架通过优化LLM的推理过程，解决了多分支推理导致的效率问题，提升了准确性和服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，LLM通过多分支推理提升输出质量，但导致时间和内存消耗大幅增加，影响服务效率。

Method: SART采用冗余采样与早期停止策略生成简短推理分支，并动态修剪低质量分支以减少内存消耗。

Result: 实验显示，SART在保持相同准确性的情况下，效率提升最高28.2倍，平均15.7倍。

Conclusion: SART框架有效平衡了LLM推理的准确性和效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling suggest that Large Language Models
(LLMs) can gain better capabilities by generating Chain-of-Thought reasoning
(analogous to human thinking) to respond a given request, and meanwhile
exploring more reasoning branches (i.e., generating multiple responses and
ensembling them) can improve the final output quality. However, when
incorporating the two scaling dimensions, we find that the system efficiency is
dampened significantly for two reasons. Firstly, the time cost to generate the
final output increases substantially as many reasoning branches would be
trapped in the over-thinking dilemma, producing excessively long responses.
Secondly, generating multiple reasoning branches for each request increases
memory consumption, which is unsuitable for LLM serving since we can only batch
a limited number of requests to process simultaneously. To address this, we
present SART, a serving framework for efficient and accurate LLM reasoning. The
essential idea is to manage the thinking to be short and right, rather than
long. For one thing, we devise a redundant sampling with early stopping
approach based on empirical observations and theoretic analysis, which
increases the likelihood of obtaining short-thinking responses when sampling
reasoning branches. For another, we propose to dynamically prune low-quality
branches so that only right-thinking branches are maintained, reducing the
memory consumption and allowing us to batch more requests. Experimental results
demonstrate that SART not only improves the accuracy of LLM reasoning but also
enhances the serving efficiency, outperforming existing methods by up to 28.2
times and on average 15.7 times in terms of efficiency when achieving the same
level of accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用噪声样本中的有价值信息并优化校正过程，实现了更稳健的学习和模型性能提升。

Abstract: Falsely annotated samples, also known as noisy labels, can significantly harm
the performance of deep learning models. Two main approaches for learning with
noisy labels are global noise estimation and data filtering. Global noise
estimation approximates the noise across the entire dataset using a noise
transition matrix, but it can unnecessarily adjust correct labels, leaving room
for local improvements. Data filtering, on the other hand, discards potentially
noisy samples but risks losing valuable data. Our method identifies potentially
noisy samples based on their loss distribution. We then apply a selection
process to separate noisy and clean samples and learn a noise transition matrix
to correct the loss for noisy samples while leaving the clean data unaffected,
thereby improving the training process. Our approach ensures robust learning
and enhanced model performance by preserving valuable information from noisy
samples and refining the correction process. We applied our method to standard
image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) and a biological scRNA-seq
cell-type annotation dataset. We observed a significant improvement in model
accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: As the complexity and number of machine learning (ML) models grows,
well-documented ML models are essential for developers and companies to use or

Motivation: MoE架构中专家并行的通信开销占总运行时间的很大比例（超过40%），限制了分布式训练和推理的可扩展性。

Result: Occult在多个MoE-LLM上实现了1.5倍以上的加速，且质量与标准微调相当或更优。

Conclusion: Occult有效减少了通信成本，显著提升了MoE模型的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures could achieve impressive computational
efficiency with expert parallelism, which relies heavily on all-to-all
communication across devices. Unfortunately, such communication overhead
typically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the
scalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models
(consuming over $40\%$ runtime in large-scale training). In this paper, we
first define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic
limitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce
communication costs. Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one
token, we call them "collaborated", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and
inter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device. Our
pilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of
intra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale. It motivates us
to strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE
training and inference, dubbed Occult. Our designs are capable of either
delivering exact results with reduced communication cost or controllably
minimizing the cost with collaboration pruning, materialized by modified
fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various MoE-LLMs demonstrate that
Occult can be faster than popular state-of-the-art inference or training
frameworks (more than $1.5\times$ speed up across multiple tasks and models)
with comparable or superior quality compared to the standard fine-tuning. Code

Conclusion: KDM通过Koopman理论实现了高效且高质量的生成，为扩散模型的蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance,
yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A
prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline
distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity,
and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a
principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed
through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools
can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose
structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on
these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel
offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework
for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM
encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator
propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples.
This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions,
the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman
representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with
semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory
alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across
standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in
a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the
experimental setups are provided in our GitHub -

access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation
(DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly
effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity
generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this
foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a
principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of
corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD
operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted
data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces
high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its
teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific
datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is
compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient
Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible
integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean
data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit
regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a
sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing
generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.

Motivation: 梯度下降是深度学习的主要学习方法，但其作为ODE求解器（欧拉方法）存在局限性。高阶RK方法虽强大，但在深度学习中应用较少，本文旨在探索其潜力。

Method: 研究了高阶RK方法在深度学习中的性能，结合现代神经网络优化器的关键要素（如预处理、自适应学习率和动量）改进其表现。

Result: 评估了高阶RK方法的性能，并提出了克服其局限性的方法。

Conclusion: 高阶RK方法在深度学习中具有潜力，通过结合现代优化技术可以进一步提升其性能。

Abstract: Modern deep learning algorithms use variations of gradient descent as their
main learning methods. Gradient descent can be understood as the simplest
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver; namely, the Euler method applied
to the gradient flow differential equation. Since Euler, many ODE solvers have
been devised that follow the gradient flow equation more precisely and more
stably. Runge-Kutta (RK) methods provide a family of very powerful explicit and
implicit high-order ODE solvers. However, these higher-order solvers have not
found wide application in deep learning so far. In this work, we evaluate the
performance of higher-order RK solvers when applied in deep learning, study
their limitations, and propose ways to overcome these drawbacks. In particular,
we explore how to improve their performance by naturally incorporating key
ingredients of modern neural network optimizers such as preconditioning,
adaptive learning rates, and momentum.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于非周期性强化学习的方法，用于改进Goemans-Williamson算法的超平面舍入策略，从而在无需训练数据的情况下获得更好的MaxCut解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MaxCut问题的NP难性使得启发式算法和基于学习的方法面临通用性和可扩展性问题。本文旨在通过强化学习优化GW算法的超平面选择，以提升切割质量。

Method: 采用非周期性强化学习框架，通过马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）优化超平面选择，替代GW算法中的随机超平面舍入。

Result: 该方法在大规模、不同密度和度分布的图上，一致性地获得了比GW算法更好的切割结果。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习优化超平面选择，本文方法显著提升了MaxCut问题的求解质量，且无需依赖训练数据。

Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal
solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms
are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain
expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled
datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with
generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for
MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite
program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly
sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node
assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a
non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to
select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced
by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our
method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying
densities and degree distributions.

Motivation: 单细胞快照数据的破坏性测量和细胞增殖/死亡导致数据未配对和不平衡，学习其动态具有挑战性。

Method: 提出VGFM，通过流匹配联合学习状态转移和质量增长，利用静态半松弛最优传输理论构建理想动态。

Result: 实验表明VGFM能捕捉质量和状态变化的生物动态，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGFM为单细胞动态建模提供了有效的新范式。

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics of single cells from snapshot data has
gained increasing attention in scientific and machine learning research. The
destructive measurement technique and cell proliferation/death result in
unpaired and unbalanced data between snapshots, making the learning of the
underlying dynamics challenging. In this paper, we propose joint
Velocity-Growth Flow Matching (VGFM), a novel paradigm that jointly learns
state transition and mass growth of single-cell populations via flow matching.
VGFM builds an ideal single-cell dynamics containing velocity of state and
growth of mass, driven by a presented two-period dynamic understanding of the
static semi-relaxed optimal transport, a mathematical tool that seeks the
coupling between unpaired and unbalanced data. To enable practical usage, we
approximate the ideal dynamics using neural networks, forming our joint
velocity and growth matching framework. A distribution fitting loss is also
employed in VGFM to further improve the fitting performance for snapshot data.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate
that VGFM can capture the underlying biological dynamics accounting for mass
and state variations over time, outperforming existing approaches for
single-cell dynamics modeling.

Motivation: 现有基于LMO的优化方法（如Muon和Scion）在实践中有优势，但理论分析存在不足，如忽略分层LMO应用和不现实的平滑性假设。

Method: 提出Gluon方法，引入新的广义平滑性模型，匹配分层几何结构，并提供收敛保证。

Result: 理论步长与实际调优值一致，实验验证了假设的有效性。

Conclusion: Gluon成功缩小了理论与实践的差距，为大规模任务提供了更可靠的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about
radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)
framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf
Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements,
offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency,
better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical
performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training. However, a
significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical
understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of
these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness
assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes. To address both, we
propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior
theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined
generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural
networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and
$\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical
predictive power. Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match
the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al. (2025). Our experiments with
NanoGPT and CNN confirm that our assumption holds along the optimization
trajectory, ultimately closing the gap between theory and practice.

Conclusion: CoT²框架通过动态实例级集成和可解释推理，提升了表格预测性能，接近专家决策水平。

Abstract: Tabular data, a fundamental data format in machine learning, is predominantly
utilized in competitions and real-world applications. The performance of
tabular models--such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural
networks--can vary significantly across datasets due to differences in feature
distributions and task characteristics. Achieving top performance on each
dataset often requires specialized expert knowledge. To address this
variability, practitioners often aggregate the predictions of multiple models.
However, conventional aggregation strategies typically rely on static
combination rules and lack instance-level adaptability. In this work, we
propose an in-context ensemble framework for tabular prediction that leverages
large language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic, instance-specific integration
of external model predictions. Without access to raw tabular features or
semantic information, our method constructs a context around each test instance
using its nearest neighbors and the predictions from a pool of external models.
Within this enriched context, we introduce Chain of Tabular Thoughts (CoT$^2$),
a prompting strategy that guides LLMs through multi-step, interpretable
reasoning, making still further progress toward expert-level decision-making.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms well-tuned baselines and
standard ensemble techniques across a wide range of tabular datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出将learnware范式应用于语言模型，通过重用专业小模型（SLMs）解决大语言模型（LLMs）在专业领域的局限性，实验结果显示其性能优于基础SLMs和部分LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在专业领域面临数据稀缺、隐私和高计算成本等问题，而专业小模型（SLMs）虽能解决部分问题，但缺乏系统化利用方式。learnware范式提供了一种协作且隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 构建了一个包含约100个8B参数SLMs的learnware系统，覆盖金融、医疗和数学领域。每个learnware包含模型及其能力描述，用户可通过描述选择合适模型而无需共享数据。

Result: 实验表明，系统在任务特定推理中优于基础SLMs，并在金融任务中超越Qwen1.5-110B等LLMs至少14%，在医疗任务中超越Flan-PaLM-540B。

Conclusion: learnware范式为语言模型提供了一种高效、隐私保护的重用机制，尤其在专业领域表现优异，未来可进一步扩展应用场景。

Abstract: The learnware paradigm offers a novel approach to machine learning by
enabling users to reuse a set of well-trained models for tasks beyond the
models' original purposes. It eliminates the need to build models from scratch,
instead relying on specifications (representations of a model's capabilities)
to identify and leverage the most suitable models for new tasks. While
learnware has proven effective in many scenarios, its application to language
models has remained largely unexplored. At the same time, large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable universal question-answering abilities, yet
they face challenges in specialized scenarios due to data scarcity, privacy
concerns, and high computational costs, thus more and more specialized small
language models (SLMs) are being trained for specific domains. To address these
limitations systematically, the learnware paradigm provides a promising
solution by enabling maximum utilization of specialized SLMs, and allowing
users to identify and reuse them in a collaborative and privacy-preserving
manner.
  This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply the learnware paradigm to
language models. We simulated a learnware system comprising approximately 100
learnwares of specialized SLMs with 8B parameters, fine-tuned across finance,
healthcare, and mathematics domains. Each learnware contains an SLM and a
specification, which enables users to identify the most relevant models without
exposing their own data. Experimental results demonstrate promising
performance: by selecting one suitable learnware for each task-specific
inference, the system outperforms the base SLMs on all benchmarks. Compared to
LLMs, the system outperforms Qwen1.5-110B, Qwen2.5-72B, and
Llama3.1-70B-Instruct by at least 14% in finance domain tasks, and surpasses
Flan-PaLM-540B (ranked 7th on the Open Medical LLM Leaderboard) in medical
domain tasks.

Result: 在图像分类和表格回归实验中，SPPI显著提升了预测效率，生成更紧凑且信息量更大的预测集。

Conclusion: SPPI在数据稀缺情况下优于传统共形预测，且无需对数据分布做假设。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide
uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper
introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPPI), a novel framework
that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve
sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an
empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real
data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score
transporter into the calibration process, SPPI provably achieves finite-sample
coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic
data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPPI yields
substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard
conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification and tabular
regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in
data-scarce settings.

Result: BLEU分数显著提升，词汇量扩大，模型准确性提高2.1-2.3倍。

Conclusion: 为实用非侵入式B2T系统扫除关键障碍，提供数据质量和词汇规模的新见解。

Abstract: Despite major advances in surgical brain-to-text (B2T), i.e. transcribing
speech from invasive brain recordings, non-invasive alternatives have yet to
surpass even chance on standard metrics. This remains a barrier to building a
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication
in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first
non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines,
raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven
by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with
LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary
B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective
vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale
non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and
improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we
offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size.
Together, our results remove a major obstacle to realising practical
non-invasive B2T systems.

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，单次评估FID达3.43，显著优于现有一步模型。

Conclusion: MeanFlow缩小了一步与多步模型的差距，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative
modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow
fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods.
A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived
and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow
model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or
curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it
achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet
256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous
state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially
narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step
predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the
foundations of these powerful models.

Abstract: We propose a neural approach for estimating spatially varying light selection

particularly for complex scenes with many light sources. Our method uses a
neural network to predict the light selection distribution at each shading
point based on local information, trained by minimizing the KL-divergence
between the learned and target distributions in an online manner. To
efficiently manage hundreds or thousands of lights, we integrate our neural
approach with light hierarchy techniques, where the network predicts

Additionally, we introduce a residual learning strategy that leverages initial

Conclusion: UniHM通过创新方法解决了场景感知运动合成的挑战，为复杂3D场景中的运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in complex scenes presents a fundamental challenge,
extending beyond conventional Text-to-Motion tasks by requiring the integration
of diverse modalities such as static environments, movable objects, natural
language prompts, and spatial waypoints. Existing language-conditioned motion
models often struggle with scene-aware motion generation due to limitations in
motion tokenization, which leads to information loss and fails to capture the
continuous, context-dependent nature of 3D human movement. To address these
issues, we propose UniHM, a unified motion language model that leverages
diffusion-based generation for synthesizing scene-aware human motion. UniHM is
the first framework to support both Text-to-Motion and Text-to-Human-Object
Interaction (HOI) in complex 3D scenes. Our approach introduces three key
contributions: (1) a mixed-motion representation that fuses continuous 6DoF
motion with discrete local motion tokens to improve motion realism; (2) a novel
Look-Up-Free Quantization VAE (LFQ-VAE) that surpasses traditional VQ-VAEs in
both reconstruction accuracy and generative performance; and (3) an enriched
version of the Lingo dataset augmented with HumanML3D annotations, providing
stronger supervision for scene-specific motion learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that UniHM achieves comparative performance on the OMOMO benchmark
for text-to-HOI synthesis and yields competitive results on HumanML3D for
general text-conditioned motion generation.

Abstract: Human aesthetic preferences for 3D shapes are central to industrial design,
virtual reality, and consumer product development. However, most computational
models of 3D aesthetics lack empirical grounding in large-scale human
judgments, limiting their practical relevance. We present a large-scale study
of human preferences. We collected 22,301 pairwise comparisons across five
object categories (chairs, tables, mugs, lamps, and dining chairs) via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Building on a previously published
dataset~\cite{dev2020learning}, we introduce new non-linear modeling and
cross-category analysis to uncover the geometric drivers of aesthetic
preference. We apply the Bradley-Terry model to infer latent aesthetic scores
and use Random Forests with SHAP analysis to identify and interpret the most
influential geometric features (e.g., symmetry, curvature, compactness). Our
cross-category analysis reveals both universal principles and domain-specific
trends in aesthetic preferences. We focus on human interpretable geometric
features to ensure model transparency and actionable design insights, rather
than relying on black-box deep learning approaches. Our findings bridge
computational aesthetics and cognitive science, providing practical guidance
for designers and a publicly available dataset to support reproducibility. This
work advances the understanding of 3D shape aesthetics through a human-centric,
data-driven framework.

Conclusion: SpikeX及其协同设计方法为SNN的高效硬件实现提供了新思路，展示了利用稀疏性和协同优化的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising biologically plausible models of
computation which utilize a spiking binary activation function similar to that
of biological neurons. SNNs are well positioned to process spatiotemporal data,
and are advantageous in ultra-low power and real-time processing. Despite a
large body of work on conventional artificial neural network accelerators, much
less attention has been given to efficient SNN hardware accelerator design. In
particular, SNNs exhibit inherent unstructured spatial and temporal firing
sparsity, an opportunity yet to be fully explored for great hardware processing
efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel systolic-array SNN accelerator
architecture, called SpikeX, to take on the challenges and opportunities
stemming from unstructured sparsity while taking into account the unique
characteristics of spike-based computation. By developing an efficient dataflow
targeting expensive multi-bit weight data movements, SpikeX reduces memory
access and increases data sharing and hardware utilization for computations
spanning across both time and space, thereby significantly improving energy
efficiency and inference latency. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of
SNN network and hardware co-design, we develop a co-optimization methodology
facilitating not only hardware-aware SNN training but also hardware accelerator
architecture search, allowing joint network weight parameter optimization and
accelerator architectural reconfiguration. This end-to-end network/accelerator
co-design approach offers a significant reduction of 15.1x-150.87x in
energy-delay-product(EDP) without comprising model accuracy.

Result: 在五个主流数据集上的实验表明，MEDL达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MEDL通过多源证据融合和渐进学习策略，有效解决了伪标签质量问题，提升了半监督医学分割的准确性。

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised medical segmentation co-learning frameworks have
realized that model performance can be diminished by the biases in model
recognition caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Due to the averaging nature of
their pseudo-label integration strategy, they fail to explore the reliability
of pseudo-labels from different sources. In this paper, we propose a mutual
evidential deep learning (MEDL) framework that offers a potentially viable
solution for pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning from two
perspectives. First, we introduce networks with different architectures to
generate complementary evidence for unlabeled samples and adopt an improved
class-aware evidential fusion to guide the confident synthesis of evidential
predictions sourced from diverse architectural networks. Second, utilizing the
uncertainty in the fused evidence, we design an asymptotic Fisher
information-based evidential learning strategy. This strategy enables the model
to initially focus on unlabeled samples with more reliable pseudo-labels,
gradually shifting attention to samples with lower-quality pseudo-labels while
avoiding over-penalization of mislabeled classes in high data uncertainty
samples. Additionally, for labeled data, we continue to adopt an
uncertainty-driven asymptotic learning strategy, gradually guiding the model to
focus on challenging voxels. Extensive experiments on five mainstream datasets
have demonstrated that MEDL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Junliang Ye,Lei Wang,Md Zakir Hossain*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FreqSelect是一种轻量级自适应模块，通过选择性过滤空间频率带提升fMRI数据重建自然图像的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于fMRI信号的噪声和低分辨率与视觉刺激的丰富性不匹配，重建自然图像仍具挑战性。现有方法对所有频率成分平等处理，限制了效果。

Method: 引入FreqSelect模块，动态选择预测性强的频率带并抑制无关噪声，无需额外监督，可集成到VAE-扩散模型中。

Result: 在Natural Scenes数据集上，FreqSelect显著提升了重建质量，并提供了频率选择模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: FreqSelect不仅提高了重建精度，还为神经科学提供了频率表征的见解，具有扩展到其他神经成像模态的潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch
between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of
fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational
autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat
all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment
forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise
simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a
lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands
before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most
predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative,
FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural
data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines
and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes
dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both
low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned
frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different
visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across
subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging
modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy
and neuroscientific interpretability.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于部分测量分数的扩散模型（MSM），无需干净图像数据即可训练，适用于噪声和子采样测量场景，并通过随机子采样和高效采样算法生成高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型需要干净的真实图像进行训练，但在许多应用中这些数据不可得。因此，研究如何在噪声和子采样测量下训练扩散模型具有重要价值。

Method: MSM通过随机子采样学习部分测量分数，并开发了一种随机采样算法，利用部分分数生成完整图像。此外，提出了一种新的后验采样方法用于解决逆问题。

Result: 理论分析表明，MSM在KL散度上界定了全采样与随机采样的分布差异，实验证明其在自然图像和多线圈MRI上能生成高质量图像并解决逆问题。

Conclusion: MSM无需干净训练数据即可高效生成图像并解决逆问题，为扩散模型在噪声数据场景下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used in applications ranging from image
generation to inverse problems. However, training diffusion models typically
requires clean ground-truth images, which are unavailable in many applications.
We introduce the Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (MSM), a novel
framework that learns partial measurement scores using only noisy and
subsampled measurements. MSM models the distribution of full measurements as an
expectation over partial scores induced by randomized subsampling. To make the
MSM representation computationally efficient, we also develop a stochastic
sampling algorithm that generates full images by using a randomly selected
subset of partial scores at each step. We additionally propose a new posterior
sampling method for solving inverse problems that reconstructs images using
these partial scores. We provide a theoretical analysis that bounds the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by full and
stochastic sampling, establishing the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of MSM on natural images and multi-coil MRI,
showing that it can generate high-quality images and solve inverse problems --
all without access to clean training data. Code is available at

TL;DR: WaLRUS（基于Daubechies小波的SaFARi实现）扩展了HiPPO方法，通过任意框架构建SSMs，解决了其对特定基的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO方法在长序列依赖建模中表现优异，但其依赖特定基的闭式解限制了其灵活性。SaFARi框架通过支持任意框架（包括非正交和冗余框架）解决了这一问题。

Method: WaLRUS基于SaFARi框架，利用Daubechies小波构建SSMs，实现了更广泛的模型多样性。

Result: WaLRUS成功扩展了SSMs的适用范围，支持更多样化的基选择。

Conclusion: WaLRUS为长序列依赖建模提供了更灵活的工具，进一步推动了SSMs的发展。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be powerful tools for modeling
long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the recent method known as
HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine
learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form
solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework
generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary
frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite
diversity of possible "species" within the SSM family. In this paper, we
introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new
implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了人工智能在颞下颌关节（TMJ）病理诊断中的应用，特别是针对MRI图像中关节盘的分割。研究通过分析现有解决方案的不足，提出了一种基于Roboflow模型的新方法，并验证了其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颞下颌关节病理的高发率及医疗诊断中对准确性和速度的需求推动了此项研究。现有工具（如Diagnocat、MandSeg）因专注于骨结构而不适用于关节盘研究。

Method: 研究收集了94张包含“颞下颌关节”和“下颌”类别的图像数据集，并通过数据增强扩充数据量。随后训练并比较了U-Net、YOLOv8n、YOLOv11n和Roboflow神经网络模型，使用Dice Score、Precision等指标进行评估。

Result: 结果表明，Roboflow模型在颞下颌关节分割中表现最佳，具有潜在应用价值。

Conclusion: 未来计划开发测量颌间距离和确定关节盘位置的算法，以进一步提升TMJ病理诊断的准确性。

Abstract: This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of
pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the
segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is
due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve
the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study,
the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result,
are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards
bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from
94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the
amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of
U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and
compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score,
Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The
results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of
the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an
algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the
position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ
pathologies.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在多种贝叶斯成像问题中表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的高斯潜在变量采样方法不仅统一了现有算法，还在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a product-of-experts-type model that
encompasses many standard prior and posterior distributions commonly found in
Bayesian imaging. We show that this model can be easily lifted into a novel
latent variable model, which we refer to as a Gaussian latent machine. This
leads to a general sampling approach that unifies and generalizes many existing
sampling algorithms in the literature. Most notably, it yields a highly
efficient and effective two-block Gibbs sampling approach in the general case,
while also specializing to direct sampling algorithms in particular cases.
Finally, we present detailed numerical experiments that demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed sampling approach across a wide
range of prior and posterior sampling problems from Bayesian imaging.

Method: 构建实验活化能数据库，应用分组算法提取材料特性特征，拟合七种机器学习模型，并通过集成共识确定关键特征。

Result: 钙钛矿的关键特征是A位键的离子性和氧分压；烧绿石的关键特征是A位s价电子数和B位电负性。这些特征均基于金属元素的加权平均值。

Conclusion: 研究确定了易于测量的关键特征，为快速筛选具有高氧离子扩散速率的新材料提供了工具。

Abstract: Explainable machine learning can help to discover new physical relationships
for material properties. To understand the material properties that govern the
activation energy for oxygen diffusion in perovskites and pyrochlores, we build
a database of experimental activation energies and apply a grouping algorithm
to the material property features. These features are then used to fit seven
different machine learning models. An ensemble consensus determines that the
most important features for predicting the activation energy are the ionicity
of the A-site bond and the partial pressure of oxygen for perovskites. For
pyrochlores, the two most important features are the A-site $s$ valence
electron count and the B-site electronegativity. The most important features
are all constructed using the weighted averages of elemental metal properties,
despite weighted averages of the constituent binary oxides being included in
our feature set. This is surprising because the material properties of the
constituent oxides are more similar to the experimentally measured properties
of perovskites and pyrochlores than the features of the metals that are chosen.
The easy-to-measure features identified in this work enable rapid screening for
new materials with fast oxide-ion diffusivity.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种结合AI生成反馈和教材引用的练习考试系统，用于大规模STEM课程，通过学生自我解释和信心评分提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模本科STEM课程中个性化反馈难以实现的挑战。

Method: 系统整合GPT-4生成个性化反馈，结合教材引用，并通过学生自我解释和信心评分收集数据。

Result: 反馈类型对成绩无显著影响，但学生自我解释和信心评分对考试策略有积极影响；40%学生使用教材引用，满意度高。

Conclusion: 结构化反思要求比复杂反馈机制更具影响力。

Abstract: Providing personalized, detailed feedback at scale in large undergraduate
STEM courses remains a persistent challenge. We present an empirically
evaluated practice exam system that integrates AI generated feedback with
targeted textbook references, deployed in a large introductory biology course.
Our system encourages metacognitive behavior by asking students to explain
their answers and declare their confidence. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate
personalized feedback based on this information, while directing them to
relevant textbook sections. Through interaction logs from consenting
participants across three midterms (541, 342, and 413 students respectively),
totaling 28,313 question-student interactions across 146 learning objectives,
along with 279 surveys and 23 interviews, we examined the system's impact on
learning outcomes and engagement. Across all midterms, feedback types showed no
statistically significant performance differences, though some trends suggested
potential benefits. The most substantial impact came from the required
confidence ratings and explanations, which students reported transferring to
their actual exam strategies. About 40 percent of students engaged with
textbook references when prompted by feedback -- far higher than traditional
reading rates. Survey data revealed high satisfaction (mean rating 4.1 of 5),
with 82.1 percent reporting increased confidence on practiced midterm topics,
and 73.4 percent indicating they could recall and apply specific concepts. Our
findings suggest that embedding structured reflection requirements may be more
impactful than sophisticated feedback mechanisms.

Motivation: 提高中程恶劣天气预测能力，以减少社会影响。

Method: 使用解码器Transformer网络处理天气预报数据，将预报时间作为序列标记，学习复杂的时间关系。与传统密集神经网络方法对比。

Result: Transformer后处理方法显著优于密集神经网络，且AI驱动的Pangu-Weather模型表现优于GFS。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了预测准确性和可靠性，并通过特征归因分析提供可解释性，推动了中程恶劣天气预测技术的发展。

Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is
crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach
leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather
forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe
weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense
neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete
forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential
``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships
within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against
post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional
dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that
exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the
Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based
post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural
networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather
initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS
in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach
offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability
through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather
prediction capabilities.

Result: 该方法显著改善整体交通流量，缓解拥堵，并减少平均堵车时间。

Conclusion: 基于赋权的分散式控制方法能有效改善交通流量，且仅需局部信息，无需显式协调。

Abstract: Traffic congestion has long been an ubiquitous problem that is exacerbating
with the rapid growth of megacities. In this proof-of-concept work we study
intrinsic motivation, implemented via the empowerment principle, to control
autonomous car behavior to improve traffic flow. In standard models of traffic
dynamics, self-organized traffic jams emerge spontaneously from the individual
behavior of cars, affecting traffic over long distances. Our novel car behavior
strategy improves traffic flow while still being decentralized and using only
locally available information without explicit coordination. Decentralization
is essential for various reasons, not least to be able to absorb robustly
substantial levels of uncertainty. Our scenario is based on the
well-established traffic dynamics model, the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular
automaton. In a fraction of the cars in this model, we substitute the default
behavior by empowerment, our intrinsic motivation-based method. This proposed
model significantly improves overall traffic flow, mitigates congestion, and
reduces the average traffic jam time.

Abstract: Air travel is one of the most widely used transportation services in the
United States. This paper analyzes the U.S. Flight Network (USFN) using complex
network theory by exploring how the network's topology contributes to its
efficiency and vulnerability. This is done by examining the structural
properties, degree distributions, and community structures in the network. USFN
was observed to follow power-law distribution and falls under the anomalous
regime, suggesting that the network is hub dominant. Compared to null networks,
USFN has a higher clustering coefficient and modularity. Various percolation
test revealed that USFN is vulnerable to targeted attacks and is susceptible to
complete cascading failure if one of the major hubs fails. The overall results
suggest that while the USFN is designed for efficiency, it is highly vulnerable
to disruptions. Protecting key hub airports is important to make the network
more robust and prevent large-scale failures.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell
clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes.
Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have
significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of
scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high
dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from
over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological
information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering
framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps:
(1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations
to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance
representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines
cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex
cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal
Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align
cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance.
Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate
that~\methodname~outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell

comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the
high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a
standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we
present \textbf{ChromFound}, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq.
ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to
effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from
dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues
and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6
diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating
universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell
type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links
undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising
framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.

### [593] [LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528)
*Yuhang Huang,JIazhao Zhang,Shilong Zou,XInwang Liu,Ruizhen Hu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LaDi-WM是一种基于扩散建模的世界模型，通过预测潜在空间状态提升机器人策略性能，实验显示其显著提升了策略表现和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测机器人-物体交互的未来视觉状态是Embodied AI中的挑战，尤其是高质量的像素级表示。LaDi-WM旨在通过潜在空间预测解决这一问题。

Method: LaDi-WM利用预训练的视觉基础模型（VFMs）的潜在空间（几何和语义特征），采用扩散建模预测未来状态，并设计扩散策略迭代优化动作。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LaDi-WM显著提升策略性能（LIBERO-LONG提升27.9%，真实场景提升20%），并展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaDi-WM通过潜在空间预测和扩散策略，有效提升了机器人策略的准确性和一致性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the
Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance
by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual
states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known
challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations.
To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space
of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the
well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models
(VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic
features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent
space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting
pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that
iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby
generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly
enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on
the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve
impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了对象中心表示（OCR）在机器人操作任务中的优势，发现OCR在泛化能力上优于全局和密集表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局或密集特征，但这些表示容易混杂任务相关和无关信息，限制了分布变化下的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过模拟和真实世界任务，比较了OCR、全局和密集表示的性能，评估其在光照、纹理和干扰物等条件下的泛化能力。

Result: OCR在泛化任务中表现优于其他方法，且无需任务特定的预训练。

Conclusion: OCR是设计动态真实世界机器人视觉系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization
capabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on
global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and
irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In
this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured
alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities,
introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks.
We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense
methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging
from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual
conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of
distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and
global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific
pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for
designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world
robotic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉环境多样性下机器人学习策略的鲁棒性问题，避免依赖不变表示或大量数据增强。

Result: 在仿真和实际硬件中展示了零样本适应性，并在模仿学习中显著提升了视觉泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态现实环境中的鲁棒操作策略提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse
visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot
learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant
representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing
generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually
diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when
combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in
enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual
distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to
simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled
representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically
complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual
perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this
approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically
show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art
imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted
from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural
network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not
only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We
believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies
that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities
and dynamical nature of real-world deployment. Supplementary videos are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的控制屏障函数（CBFs）在高维度下难以实现平滑和准确，缺乏安全性保证。

Method: 利用PINNs计算Hamilton-Jacobi最优控制解，生成平滑的CBFs近似（RBNs），并通过参数化折扣项和保形预测方法确保鲁棒性。

Result: 在低维度下RBNs高度准确，在高维度下比标准神经CBF方法更安全，如在9D多车避碰问题中安全性提高5.5倍，保守性降低1.9倍。

Conclusion: RBNs为非线性自治系统合成CBFs提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in autonomous driving and robotics underscore the
necessity of safety-critical controllers. Control barrier functions (CBFs) are
a popular method for appending safety guarantees to a general control
framework, but they are notoriously difficult to generate beyond low
dimensions. Existing methods often yield non-differentiable or inaccurate
approximations that lack integrity, and thus fail to ensure safety. In this
work, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate smooth
approximations of CBFs by computing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) optimal control
solutions. These reachability barrier networks (RBNs) avoid traditional
dimensionality constraints and support the tuning of their conservativeness
post-training through a parameterized discount term. To ensure robustness of
the discounted solutions, we leverage conformal prediction methods to derive
probabilistic safety guarantees for RBNs. We demonstrate that RBNs are highly
accurate in low dimensions, and safer than the standard neural CBF approach in
high dimensions. Namely, we showcase the RBNs in a 9D multi-vehicle collision
avoidance problem where it empirically proves to be 5.5x safer and 1.9x less
conservative than the neural CBFs, offering a promising method to synthesize
CBFs for general nonlinear autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在开放世界中表现不佳，主要因训练数据集中于成功示范且缺乏失败恢复能力。

Method: 构建RoboFAC数据集（9,440错误轨迹和78,623 QA对），并开发具备任务理解、失败分析和纠正能力的RoboFAC模型。

Result: RoboFAC模型在评估基准上优于GPT-4o 34.1%，实际任务中平均提升29.1%。

Conclusion: RoboFAC框架有效处理机器人失败并辅助VLA模型恢复，显著提升开放世界中的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic
manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information
into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in
open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert
demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this
work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework
to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440
erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks
and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our
dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding,
Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that
the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark.
Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control
pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding
a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results
show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and
assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的自动驾驶规划方法，通过混合正常和对抗性行为预测，实现鲁棒性规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常过度加权对抗性行为或使用不适用于所有场景的硬安全约束，导致规划过于保守或不灵活。

Method: 训练扩散模型学习正常行为分布，测试时生成对抗性预测，并通过混合分布评分候选计划。

Result: 在单/多代理横穿马路和闯红灯场景中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持鲁棒性的同时避免了过度保守，适用于复杂驾驶场景。

Abstract: We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal
and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for
motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased
distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of
adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate
predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans
using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and
adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against
adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally.
Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight
adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal
behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all
driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and
multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.

TL;DR: DynamicDTA是一种深度学习框架，结合静态和动态蛋白质特征，显著提升了药物-靶标结合亲和力（DTA）预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖静态蛋白质结构，忽略了蛋白质的动态特性，而动态特性对结合亲和力预测至关重要。

Method: DynamicDTA整合药物序列、蛋白质序列和动态描述符，通过图卷积网络、扩张卷积和多层感知机处理输入，并使用交叉注意力和张量融合网络整合特征。

Result: 在三个数据集上，DynamicDTA的RMSE得分比现有方法至少提升3.4%，并在HIV-1药物预测中验证了其可靠性。

Conclusion: DynamicDTA通过融合动态蛋白质特征，显著提升了DTA预测性能，具有重要的生物学意义。

Abstract: Predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA) is essential for identifying
potential therapeutic candidates in drug discovery. However, most existing
models rely heavily on static protein structures, often overlooking the dynamic
nature of proteins, which is crucial for capturing conformational flexibility
that will be beneficial for protein binding interactions. We introduce
DynamicDTA, an innovative deep learning framework that incorporates static and
dynamic protein features to enhance DTA prediction. The proposed DynamicDTA
takes three types of inputs, including drug sequence, protein sequence, and
dynamic descriptors. A molecular graph representation of the drug sequence is
generated and subsequently processed through graph convolutional network, while
the protein sequence is encoded using dilated convolutions. Dynamic
descriptors, such as root mean square fluctuation, are processed through a
multi-layer perceptron. These embedding features are fused with static protein
features using cross-attention, and a tensor fusion network integrates all
three modalities for DTA prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that DynamicDTA achieves by at least 3.4% improvement in RMSE score
with comparison to seven state-of-the-art baseline methods. Additionally,
predicting novel drugs for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and visualizing
the docking complexes further demonstrates the reliability and biological
relevance of DynamicDTA.

Motivation: 研究动机在于填补对实际LKA系统性能的实证研究空白，揭示其故障模式及环境影响因素，以推动更安全的自动驾驶技术发展。

Method: 通过分析LKA相关的CAN信号，系统分类故障模式（感知、规划、控制），并统计环境与道路条件对故障的影响。

Result: 发现LKA系统在弯道中易向外漂移，且褪色车道线、低对比度和急弯是主要故障诱因。提出了改进基础设施设计的模型和评估工具。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LKA系统的局限性，为基础设施优化和自动驾驶技术改进提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Leveraging a newly released open dataset of Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) systems
from production vehicles, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical
analysis of real-world LKA performance. Our study yields three key findings:
(i) LKA failures can be systematically categorized into perception, planning,
and control errors. We present representative examples of each failure mode
through in-depth analysis of LKA-related CAN signals, enabling both
justification of the failure mechanisms and diagnosis of when and where each
module begins to degrade; (ii) LKA systems tend to follow a fixed
lane-centering strategy, often resulting in outward drift that increases
linearly with road curvature, whereas human drivers proactively steer slightly
inward on similar curved segments; (iii) We provide the first statistical
summary and distribution analysis of environmental and road conditions under
LKA failures, identifying with statistical significance that faded lane
markings, low pavement laneline contrast, and sharp curvature are the most
dominant individual factors, along with critical combinations that
substantially increase failure likelihood. Building on these insights, we
propose a theoretical model that integrates road geometry, speed limits, and
LKA steering capability to inform infrastructure design. Additionally, we
develop a machine learning-based model to assess roadway readiness for LKA
deployment, offering practical tools for safer infrastructure planning,
especially in rural areas. This work highlights key limitations of current LKA
systems and supports the advancement of safer and more reliable autonomous
driving technologies.

Conclusion: LKAlert提升了ADAS的安全性和可用性，为黑盒自动化的人机监督提供了可扩展范例。

Abstract: Lane Keeping Assist systems, while increasingly prevalent, often suffer from
unpredictable real-world failures, largely due to their opaque, black-box
nature, which limits driver anticipation and trust. To bridge the gap between
automated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel
supervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3
seconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating
surrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as
automated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert
issues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation,
enhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development
and evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark
dataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It
contains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications
across annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable
methodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining
surrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over
structured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it
broadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable
oversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with
69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\% F1-score. The system also generates high-quality
textual explanations for drivers (71.7 ROUGE-L) and operates efficiently at
approximately 2 Hz, confirming its suitability for real-time, in-vehicle use.
Our findings establish LKAlert as a practical solution for enhancing the safety
and usability of current ADAS and offer a scalable paradigm for applying VLMs
to human-centered supervision of black-box automation.

Conclusion: 该综述为FMRs的物理风险控制提供了高分辨率分析，有助于实现良好的人机关系。

Abstract: Recent Foundation Model-enabled robotics (FMRs) display greatly improved
general-purpose skills, enabling more adaptable automation than conventional
robotics. Their ability to handle diverse tasks thus creates new opportunities
to replace human labor. However, unlike general foundation models, FMRs
interact with the physical world, where their actions directly affect the
safety of humans and surrounding objects, requiring careful deployment and
control. Based on this proposition, our survey comprehensively summarizes robot
control approaches to mitigate physical risks by covering all the lifespan of
FMRs ranging from pre-deployment to post-accident stage. Specifically, we
broadly divide the timeline into the following three phases: (1) pre-deployment
phase, (2) pre-incident phase, and (3) post-incident phase. Throughout this
survey, we find that there is much room to study (i) pre-incident risk
mitigation strategies, (ii) research that assumes physical interaction with
humans, and (iii) essential issues of foundation models themselves. We hope
that this survey will be a milestone in providing a high-resolution analysis of
the physical risks of FMRs and their control, contributing to the realization
of a good human-robot relationship.

Abstract: We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for
training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments
through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world
models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models,
adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic
synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since
these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using
either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its
simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a
humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen
environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single
pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline
systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that
shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy
success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning
well beyond manual data collection.

Abstract: Teleoperation is a cornerstone of embodied-robot learning, and bimanual
dexterous teleoperation in particular provides rich demonstrations that are
difficult to obtain with fully autonomous systems. While recent studies have
proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves
to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark
that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we
introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual
dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task
environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative
manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction
difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative
teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand
exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a
common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is
predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a
physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10
held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware
performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench
establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an
extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately
addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies,
reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived
controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often
require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping)
states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand
manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for
bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning
agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our
experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of
in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an
implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system,
enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.

Result: SR生成的公式复杂度与传统方法相当，但精度更高，并可扩展至负载依赖等动态因素。

Conclusion: 符号回归是一种有效的方法，能够平衡精度、可解释性和灵活性，适用于机器人硬件和安全关键应用。

Abstract: Accurately modeling the friction torque in robotic joints has long been
challenging due to the request for a robust mathematical description.
Traditional model-based approaches are often labor-intensive, requiring
extensive experiments and expert knowledge, and they are difficult to adapt to
new scenarios and dependencies. On the other hand, data-driven methods based on
neural networks are easier to implement but often lack robustness,
interpretability, and trustworthiness--key considerations for robotic hardware
and safety-critical applications such as human-robot interaction. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose the use of symbolic regression
(SR) to estimate the friction torque. SR generates interpretable symbolic
formulas similar to those produced by model-based methods while being flexible
to accommodate various dynamic effects and dependencies. In this work, we apply
SR algorithms to approximate the friction torque using collected data from a
KUKA LWR-IV+ robot. Our results show that SR not only yields formulas with
comparable complexity to model-based approaches but also achieves higher
accuracy. Moreover, SR-derived formulas can be seamlessly extended to include
load dependencies and other dynamic factors.

Abstract: One of the most important object properties that humans and robots perceive
through touch is hardness. This paper investigates information-theoretic active
sampling strategies for sample-efficient hardness classification with
vision-based tactile sensors. We evaluate three probabilistic classifier models
and two model-uncertainty-based sampling strategies on a robotic setup as well

findings indicate that the active sampling approaches, driven by uncertainty
metrics, surpass a random sampling baseline in terms of accuracy and stability.
Additionally, while in our human study, the participants achieve an average

<details>

Motivation: 现有装箱方法主要关注物体形状以优化紧凑性，忽略了人类装箱时考虑的物体属性（如易碎性、相容性）。

Method: 开发了基于检索增强生成和链式推理的属性识别方案，构建了包含1032个日常物体属性标注的数据集，设计了OPA-Net模型，结合属性嵌入层和高度图，采用深度Q学习训练。

Result: 实验显示，OPA-Pack显著提高了不相容物体对的分离准确率（从52%到95%），减少了易碎物体压力（降低29.4%），同时保持良好紧凑性。

Conclusion: OPA-Pack在实际装箱平台上验证了其有效性，展示了其在现实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Robotic bin packing aids in a wide range of real-world scenarios such as
e-commerce and warehouses. Yet, existing works focus mainly on considering the
shape of objects to optimize packing compactness and neglect object properties
such as fragility, edibility, and chemistry that humans typically consider when
packing objects. This paper presents OPA-Pack (Object-Property-Aware Packing
framework), the first framework that equips the robot with object property
considerations in planning the object packing. Technical-wise, we develop a
novel object property recognition scheme with retrieval-augmented generation
and chain-of-thought reasoning, and build a dataset with object property
annotations for 1,032 everyday objects. Also, we formulate OPA-Net, aiming to
jointly separate incompatible object pairs and reduce pressure on fragile
objects, while compacting the packing. Further, OPA-Net consists of a property
embedding layer to encode the property of candidate objects to be packed,
together with a fragility heightmap and an avoidance heightmap to keep track of
the packed objects. Then, we design a reward function and adopt a deep
Q-learning scheme to train OPA-Net. Experimental results manifest that OPA-Pack
greatly improves the accuracy of separating incompatible object pairs (from 52%
to 95%) and largely reduces pressure on fragile objects (by 29.4%), while
maintaining good packing compactness. Besides, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of OPA-Pack on a real packing platform, showcasing its practicality in
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSAN的端到端训练方法，用于解决细粒度视频片段检索中的高效计算和低存储消耗问题，通过SKE和SPD模块显著提升了检索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络视频的爆炸式增长，细粒度视频片段检索（S-CBVR）在视频过滤、推荐和版权保护中变得至关重要，但现有方法在计算效率和存储消耗方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出了SSAN网络，包含两个新模块：自监督关键帧提取（SKE）以减少冗余帧特征，以及相似性模式检测（SPD）用于高精度时间对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SSAN在公共数据集上比现有方法具有更高的对齐精度，同时节省了存储和在线查询计算成本。

Conclusion: SSAN通过端到端训练和模块化设计，显著提升了视频片段检索的性能和效率，且其关键模块可灵活应用于其他视频检索流程。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of web videos in recent years, large-scale
Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) becomes increasingly essential in video
filtering, recommendation, and copyright protection. Segment-level CBVR
(S-CBVR) locates the start and end time of similar segments in finer
granularity, which is beneficial for user browsing efficiency and infringement
detection especially in long video scenarios. The challenge of S-CBVR task is
how to achieve high temporal alignment accuracy with efficient computation and
low storage consumption. In this paper, we propose a Segment Similarity and
Alignment Network (SSAN) in dealing with the challenge which is firstly trained
end-to-end in S-CBVR. SSAN is based on two newly proposed modules in video
retrieval: (1) An efficient Self-supervised Keyframe Extraction (SKE) module to
reduce redundant frame features, (2) A robust Similarity Pattern Detection
(SPD) module for temporal alignment. In comparison with uniform frame
extraction, SKE not only saves feature storage and search time, but also
introduces comparable accuracy and limited extra computation time. In terms of
temporal alignment, SPD localizes similar segments with higher accuracy and
efficiency than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we jointly train
SSAN with SKE and SPD and achieve an end-to-end improvement. Meanwhile, the two
key modules SKE and SPD can also be effectively inserted into other video
retrieval pipelines and gain considerable performance improvements.
Experimental results on public datasets show that SSAN can obtain higher
alignment accuracy while saving storage and online query computational cost
compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 视频数据的爆炸式增长使得视频场景识别变得重要，但现有方法仅关注单一视角（时间或非时间），忽略了互补性和外部知识的价值。

Method: 设计双流框架，分别建模时间和非时间视角，通过自蒸馏整合两者，并引入知识增强的特征融合和标签预测方法。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 多视角结合和知识引入显著提升了视频场景识别的性能。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in real-world applications, a
comprehensive representation of videos becomes increasingly important. In this
paper, we address the problem of video scene recognition, whose goal is to
learn a high-level video representation to classify scenes in videos. Due to
the diversity and complexity of video contents in realistic scenarios, this
task remains a challenge. Most existing works identify scenes for videos only
from visual or textual information in a temporal perspective, ignoring the
valuable information hidden in single frames, while several earlier studies
only recognize scenes for separate images in a non-temporal perspective. We
argue that these two perspectives are both meaningful for this task and
complementary to each other, meanwhile, externally introduced knowledge can
also promote the comprehension of videos. We propose a novel two-stream
framework to model video representations from multiple perspectives, i.e.
temporal and non-temporal perspectives, and integrate the two perspectives in
an end-to-end manner by self-distillation. Besides, we design a
knowledge-enhanced feature fusion and label prediction method that contributes
to naturally introducing knowledge into the task of video scene recognition.
Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

Abstract: Few-shot adaptation remains a core challenge for vision-language models

propose PromptFuseNL, a unified framework that enhances few-shot generalization
by combining predictive prompt tuning with dual-branch positive and negative
learning. The method refines class prototypes through task-conditioned
residuals, multi-stage cross-modal coordination, and semantic hard negative
mining. To address label noise, we introduce an unsupervised instance
reweighting strategy that downweights unreliable support examples without
requiring additional labels or structural changes. PromptFuseNL fuses visual
and textual cues through lightweight modules for efficient and discriminative
prediction. Evaluated across 15 benchmarks, it consistently surpasses existing
prompt- and adapter-based methods in all shot settings while remaining highly
efficient, achieving up to 300x faster training and 1000x lower FLOPs compared
to full prompt tuning, achieving a new state-of-the-art for robust and scalable
few-shot vision-language adaptation.

Result: 实验表明，CL-CaGAN在跨域场景中表现出更高的检测性能和持续学习能力。

Conclusion: CL-CaGAN有效提升了高光谱异常检测的跨场景适应性和持续学习能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral
image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based
algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through
specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior
information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges
for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to
improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule
differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate
the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application
of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule
structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the
background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To
mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay
strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated
for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the
discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current
scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual
learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced
to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further
stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently
consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the
effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real
HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher
detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the
catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在不确定性和模糊输入下的鲁棒性有所提升，但仍存在过度自信的问题。通过简单提示模型避免不确定预测，可在自然图像任务中显著提高可靠性，但在领域特定任务中仍受限于知识不足。

Method: 使用异常检测和模糊分类任务评估模型，提出基于提示的改进方法，并引入基于标题多样性的新机制揭示模型内部不确定性。

Result: 新模型在自然图像任务中通过提示实现接近完美的鲁棒性，但在领域特定任务中表现不佳。新机制能有效预测模型何时会成功避免不确定预测。

Conclusion: 大规模VLMs在鲁棒性方面有所改进，但仍需进一步优化，尤其是在领域特定任务中。新机制为无标签数据下的不确定性预测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for
deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language
models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training
dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more
complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty
quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently
ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit
improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a
tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate
confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs.
Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be
overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain
from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving
near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks
such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge
prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism
based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling
practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying
on labeled data.

Abstract: Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often
struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity
of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While
existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation,
they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook
intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model
characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity,
faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach
employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve
foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label
consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive
experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness
tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了接近一阶最优的数据效率，为利用部分数据训练扩散模型提供了理论支持和实用方案。

Abstract: Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large
volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large
numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are
many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such
as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data
include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we
investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be
utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical
analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training
diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of
complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first
trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a
model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error
bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can
achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in
the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the
difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with
the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the
proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of
Deep- Thinking Models and chain-of-thought technology, which has become a

which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance
gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main
components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and
video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for
categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a
wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema

Motivation: 标准残差连接可能导致模块输出主要强化或调制输入流方向，未能充分利用模块学习新特征的能力。

Method: 引入正交残差更新，分解模块输出并仅添加与输入流正交的分量。

Result: 在多种架构（ResNetV2、Vision Transformers）和数据集（CIFARs、TinyImageNet、ImageNet-1k）上提升泛化准确率和训练稳定性，例如ViT-B在ImageNet-1k上提升4.3% top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 正交残差更新策略有效促进新特征学习，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater
depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates,
the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to
updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction,
potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel
features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose
the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component
orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute
primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning
while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal
update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across
diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs,
TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy
gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.

Motivation: 视频大型多模态模型（VLMMs）的复杂性导致静态安全对齐在动态视频场景中失效，亟需针对性解决方案。

Method: SafeVid框架包括：1）生成350,000对视频安全偏好数据集SafeVid-350K；2）使用直接偏好优化（DPO）对齐VLMMs；3）通过SafeVidBench进行全面评估。

Conclusion: SafeVid通过文本描述作为安全推理桥梁，显著改善了VLMMs的安全对齐，并公开了数据集SafeVid-350K。

Abstract: As Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) rapidly advance, their inherent
complexity introduces significant safety challenges, particularly the issue of
mismatched generalization where static safety alignments fail to transfer to
dynamic video contexts. We introduce SafeVid, a framework designed to instill
video-specific safety principles in VLMMs. SafeVid uniquely transfers robust
textual safety alignment capabilities to the video domain by employing detailed
textual video descriptions as an interpretive bridge, facilitating LLM-based
rule-driven safety reasoning. This is achieved through a closed-loop system
comprising: 1) generation of SafeVid-350K, a novel 350,000-pair video-specific
safety preference dataset; 2) targeted alignment of VLMMs using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO); and 3) comprehensive evaluation via our new
SafeVidBench benchmark. Alignment with SafeVid-350K significantly enhances VLMM
safety, with models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video demonstrating substantial
improvements (e.g., up to 42.39%) on SafeVidBench. SafeVid provides critical
resources and a structured approach, demonstrating that leveraging textual
descriptions as a conduit for safety reasoning markedly improves the safety
alignment of VLMMs. We have made SafeVid-350K dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/yxwang/SafeVid-350K) publicly available.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises
safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal
safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static
image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct
safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under
video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48
fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a
harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears
harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To
generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a
controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what
is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of
query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful
outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the
confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration.
Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average
attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to
video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future
research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

*Yi Chen,Mu-Young Son,Chuanbo Hua,Joo-Young Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AoP-SAM是一种自动生成提示的方法，提升了SAM模型的效率和实用性，适用于实际任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提示在实际应用中不切实际，尤其是在需要快速提供提示和资源效率的场景中。

Method: AoP-SAM通过轻量级Prompt Predictor模型自动生成关键提示，并利用SAM的图像嵌入保持零样本泛化能力。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估表明，AoP-SAM显著提高了提示生成效率和掩模生成准确性。

Conclusion: AoP-SAM使SAM更适用于自动化分割任务，提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model for image
segmentation, showing robust zero-shot generalization through prompt
engineering. However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world
applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and
resource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of
Prompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential
prompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency
and usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for
real-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt
Predictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the
optimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's
image embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without
requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test-time instance-level
Adaptive Sampling and Filtering mechanism that generates prompts in a
coarse-to-fine manner. This notably enhances both prompt and mask generation
efficiency by reducing computational overhead and minimizing redundant mask
refinements. Evaluations of three datasets demonstrate that AoP-SAM
substantially improves both prompt generation efficiency and mask generation
accuracy, making SAM more effective for automated segmentation tasks.

### [623] [Online Iterative Self-Alignment for Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11983)
*Ting Xiao,Lei Shi,Yang Zhang,HaoFeng Yang,Zhe Wang,Chenjia Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为在线迭代自对齐（OISA）的新方法，用于放射学报告生成（RRG），通过自生成多样化数据、自评估多目标偏好数据、自对齐多目标优化和自迭代进一步改进，显著提升了数据质量和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RRG模型主要依赖监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），但高质量标注数据覆盖不足可能导致过拟合和泛化问题。本文旨在通过自对齐方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出OISA方法，包括四个阶段：自生成多样化数据、自评估多目标偏好数据、自对齐多目标优化和自迭代改进。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个评估指标上超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: OISA方法通过迭代多目标优化显著提升了RRG模型的数据质量和性能，为临床目标提供了多样化的报告生成能力。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important research topic for
relieving radiologist' heavy workload. Existing RRG models mainly rely on
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data
pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports.
Recent research has shifted focus to post-training improvements, aligning RRG
model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL).
However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks
of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative
Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages:
self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference
data,self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for
further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored
to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG
model iteratively. Unlike existing methods, our frame-work significantly
increases data quality and optimizes performance through iterative
multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across
multiple evaluation metrics.

*Dong Liu,Yifan Yang,Zixiong Huang,Yuxin Gao,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHRIS方法通过侧视图一致性提升单视角RGB图像中穿衣人体的重建质量，解决了全局拓扑和局部表面不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用侧视图信息，导致重建结果在侧视图中不真实。

Method: 1) 侧视图法线判别器增强全局合理性；2) 多对一梯度计算（M2O）确保局部表面一致性。

Result: CHRIS在公开基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: CHRIS通过侧视图一致性和梯度平滑操作，显著提升了穿衣人体重建的真实性。

Abstract: Creating a realistic clothed human from a single-view RGB image is crucial
for applications like mixed reality and filmmaking. Despite some progress in
recent years, mainstream methods often fail to fully utilize side-view
information, as the input single-view image contains front-view information
only. This leads to globally unrealistic topology and local surface
inconsistency in side views. To address these, we introduce Clothed Human
Reconstruction with Side View Consistency, namely CHRIS, which consists of 1) A
Side-View Normal Discriminator that enhances global visual reasonability by
distinguishing the generated side-view normals from the ground truth ones; 2) A
Multi-to-One Gradient Computation (M2O) that ensures local surface consistency.
M2O calculates the gradient of a sampling point by integrating the gradients of
the nearby points, effectively acting as a smooth operation. Experimental
results demonstrate that CHRIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on public
benchmarks and outperforms the prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Duration-Proportional Information Assumption的视频Tokenizer（VFRTok），通过可变帧率编码和解码提高效率，并引入Partial RoPE提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成框架因Frame-Proportional Information Assumption导致计算成本随帧率线性增长，效率低下。

Method: 提出VFRTok，支持可变帧率编码和解码；引入Partial RoPE解耦位置与内容建模。

Result: VFRTok仅用1/8的token即可达到竞争性重建质量和最佳生成保真度。

Conclusion: VFRTok通过紧凑的时空表示显著提升了视频生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer
from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information
Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates,
causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with
the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information
Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is
proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this
insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that
enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate
training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes
Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content
modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE
effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation
capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal
representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and
state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to
existing tokenizers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多任务作物产量预测网络（MT-CYP-Net），通过共享特征和稀疏标签训练，实现了高精度的像素级作物产量预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于卫星遥感数据的像素级产量预测因地面真实数据稀缺而受限的问题。

Method: 采用多任务特征共享策略，结合作物产量预测和分类解码器，利用稀疏标签训练模型。

Result: 在黑龙江八家农场的数据集上，MT-CYP-Net优于传统方法，展示了在有限标签下进行精确预测的潜力。

Conclusion: MT-CYP-Net为稀疏标签下的像素级作物产量预测提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Accurate and fine-grained crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in
advancing global agriculture. However, the accuracy of pixel-level yield
estimation based on satellite remote sensing data has been constrained by the
scarcity of ground truth data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
approach called the Multi-Task Crop Yield Prediction Network (MT-CYP-Net). This
framework introduces an effective multi-task feature-sharing strategy, where
features extracted from a shared backbone network are simultaneously utilized
by both crop yield prediction decoders and crop classification decoders with
the ability to fuse information between them. This design allows MT-CYP-Net to
be trained with extremely sparse crop yield point labels and crop type labels,
while still generating detailed pixel-level crop yield maps. Concretely, we
collected 1,859 yield point labels along with corresponding crop type labels
and satellite images from eight farms in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2023,
covering soybean, maize, and rice crops, and constructed a sparse crop yield
label dataset. MT-CYP-Net is compared with three classical machine learning and
deep learning benchmark methods in this dataset. Experimental results not only
indicate the superiority of MT-CYP-Net compared to previous methods on multiple
types of crops but also demonstrate the potential of deep networks on precise
pixel-level crop yield prediction, especially with limited data labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogicOCR是一个包含1100道选择题的基准测试，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在文本丰富图像上的逻辑推理能力，同时减少对领域特定知识的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LMMs在推理和OCR能力上取得了进展，但其在涉及文本丰富图像的复杂逻辑推理任务上的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过从中国国家公务员考试中筛选文本语料库，并开发自动化流程将其转化为多模态样本，生成多样化的图像并通过人工验证。

Result: 评估显示LMMs在多模态推理上仍落后于纯文本输入，且对视觉-文本方向敏感。

Conclusion: LogicOCR有望成为推动多模态推理研究的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved
their reasoning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. However,
their performance on complex logical reasoning tasks involving text-rich images
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark
comprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical
reasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on
domain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by
curating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and
develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples.
First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with
diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts,
ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images
are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range
of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key
insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences,
and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in
multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have
not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as
a valuable resource for advancing multimodal reasoning research. The dataset is

ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune
ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial
reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests
paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to
foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general
vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial
layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing
models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized
training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2
(Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial

for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio
control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new
large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs
for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our
ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly
surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and
leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence
with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset
to facilitate further research.

Method: EarthSynth采用Counterfactual Composition训练策略增强数据多样性和类别控制，并提出R-Filter规则方法筛选合成数据。

Result: 模型在场景分类、目标检测和语义分割等开放世界场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: EarthSynth为遥感图像解释任务提供了一种实用的解决方案，首次探索了多任务生成方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to
the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI
interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a
diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing
multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI
interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to
explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the
EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training
strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control.
Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more
informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on
scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world
scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重叠关节或快速变化姿态的场景中表现不佳，需要一种更有效的方法来统一处理姿态估计和实例分割。

Method: KDC采用自下而上的范式生成关键点热图，并通过KeyCentroids和MaskCentroids动态聚类像素到特定人体实例。

Result: 在CrowdPose、OCHuman和COCO基准测试中，KDC在准确性和运行时性能上表现出色。

Conclusion: KDC是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于复杂场景中的人体姿态估计和实例分割。

Abstract: The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for
human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches
primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often
struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses
during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose
Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for
unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a
bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily
distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and
confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It
leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space
to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific
human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our
experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks
demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios
in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance. The implementation is

performance gain of 18.11%p on an unseen mobile OS platform. To enable
continuous dataset expansion as mobile platforms evolve, we present an
automated framework that leverages publicly available video content to create
comprehensive task datasets without manual annotation. Our framework comprises
robust OCR-based scene detection (95.04% F1score), near-perfect UI element

### [633] [SoftPQ: Robust Instance Segmentation Evaluation via Soft Matching and Tunable Thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12155)
*Ranit Karmakar,Simon F. Nørrelykke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的实例分割评估指标SoftPQ，通过引入可调的上限和下限IoU阈值以及子线性惩罚函数，解决了传统二元逻辑评估指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割评估指标（如PQ）依赖硬阈值匹配，将预测结果简单地分为正确或错误，忽略了错误之间的质量差异，且无法反映模型的渐进改进。

Method: SoftPQ通过定义部分匹配区域和应用子线性惩罚函数，将评估重新定义为连续渐变的过程，而非二元分类。

Result: 实验表明，SoftPQ能够更平滑地反映分割质量差异，对结构分割错误更具鲁棒性，并为模型开发提供更有价值的反馈。

Conclusion: SoftPQ是一种灵活且可解释的评估指标，适用于基准测试和迭代模型优化，能够捕捉现有指标忽略的质量差异。

Abstract: Segmentation evaluation metrics traditionally rely on binary decision logic:
predictions are either correct or incorrect, based on rigid IoU thresholds.
Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object
level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like
Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often
overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify
detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on
hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely
incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between
qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements.
We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric
that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary
classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to
define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to
ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit
smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors,
and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through
controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful
differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a
practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model
refinement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督框架，用于在噪声数据中学习鲁棒表示，无需推理时的去噪器或下游微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）通常针对干净数据集，而噪声数据（如天体物理学、医学影像等）的应用仍具挑战性。

Method: 框架包括训练SSL去噪器，构建去噪到噪声的数据课程，结合教师引导的正则化，以增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在极端高斯噪声下，方法比DINOv2提高了4.8%的线性探测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过噪声感知预训练实现了无需去噪器的鲁棒性，简化了部署。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich
representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on
clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy
data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as
astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present
a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation
learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning.
Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to
construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on
denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2),
combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to
their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize
noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining,
simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise
($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by
4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from
noise-aware pretraining. The code is available at

TL;DR: ACDepth提出了一种鲁棒的单目深度估计方法，通过高质量训练数据生成和域适应，解决了恶劣天气下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恶劣天气下性能下降，主要由于域偏移和场景信息提取困难。

Method: 采用扩散模型生成恶劣天气样本，构建多组退化数据集，结合LoRA适配器、循环一致性损失和对抗训练，并设计多粒度知识蒸馏策略（MKD）和序数引导蒸馏机制（OGD）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，ACDepth在夜间和雨天场景的absRel指标上分别优于md4all-DD 2.50%和2.61%。

Conclusion: ACDepth通过数据生成和域适应策略，显著提升了恶劣天气下的深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous
driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under
normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to
challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To
address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method
called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data
generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step
diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather
conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To
ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA
adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally,
we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee
the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate
on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages
the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and
pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in
learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation
inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism
(OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through
differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental
results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night
scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel
metric.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various
domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS)
remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios
exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity
in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four
task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding,
and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop
identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a
high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one
private farmland plot dataset, containing 25,026 QA pairs and 15,556 images.
The pipeline begins with multi-source data preprocessing, including collection,
format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse
set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of
tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and
performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 18 open-source LMMs and 3
closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance
gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is
notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By
establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind
reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical
challenges for future work. Data and code can be accessed at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMS-VPR是一个大规模多模态数据集，专注于复杂行人环境中的视觉地点识别，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR数据集主要依赖车载图像，缺乏多模态多样性，且对非西方城市环境的密集混合用途街道空间代表性不足。

Method: 通过系统化的数据收集协议，在成都一个商业区采集了78,575张标注图像和2,512个视频片段，覆盖多种光照、视角和时间条件。

Result: 实验表明，利用多模态和结构线索时，传统VPR模型、图神经网络和多模态基线模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MMS-VPR为计算机视觉、地理空间理解和多模态推理的交叉研究提供了支持，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Existing visual place recognition (VPR) datasets predominantly rely on
vehicle-mounted imagery, lack multimodal diversity and underrepresent dense,
mixed-use street-level spaces, especially in non-Western urban contexts. To
address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for
street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The
dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across
207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in
Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp,
and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and
timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection
protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable
dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with
125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place
recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets --
Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based
evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph
neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when
leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research
at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and
multimodal reasoning. The dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决传统几何优化与端到端神经网络训练的结合问题，提升4D雷达点云的稀疏表示能力。

Method: 结合神经网络估计点运动流，构建基于点运动与3D位姿关系的成本函数，并通过高斯牛顿更新优化雷达位姿；设计了双流4D雷达主干网络，融合多尺度几何特征和聚类感知特征。

Result: 在VoD和Snail-Radar数据集上表现优异，性能超越经典和学习方法，甚至接近基于LiDAR的A-LOAM。

Conclusion: DNOI-4DRO模型通过创新方法实现了高性能，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: A novel learning-optimization-combined 4D radar odometry model, named
DNOI-4DRO, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model seamlessly integrates
traditional geometric optimization with end-to-end neural network training,
leveraging an innovative differentiable neural-optimization iteration operator.
In this framework, point-wise motion flow is first estimated using a neural
network, followed by the construction of a cost function based on the
relationship between point motion and pose in 3D space. The radar pose is then
refined using Gauss-Newton updates. Additionally, we design a dual-stream 4D
radar backbone that integrates multi-scale geometric features and
clustering-based class-aware features to enhance the representation of sparse
4D radar point clouds. Extensive experiments on the VoD and Snail-Radar
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, which outperforms
recent classical and learning-based approaches. Notably, our method even
achieves results comparable to A-LOAM with mapping optimization using LiDAR
point clouds as input. Our models and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的开放世界深度伪造检测任务，并设计了一种增强训练策略（OWG-DS），通过优化域距离和类边界分离来提升模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，伪造方法快速涌现，社交平台上大量未标记的合成数据与真实数据混合，现有监督检测方法难以应对未知伪造方法的检测。

Method: 提出OWG-DS策略，包括域距离优化（DDO）模块和相似性类边界分离（SCBS）模块，结合对抗训练学习域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨方法和跨数据集场景中表现优异，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OWG-DS策略有效解决了开放世界深度伪造检测的挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery
methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of
unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging
to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised
detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown
deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled
data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake
detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient
detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to
simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a
novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training
Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods.
Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount
of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data.
Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to
align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and
intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary
Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples
to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is
adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy
excels in cross-method and cross-dataset scenarios, improving the model's
generalization.

TL;DR: ViEEG是一种受生物学启发的分层EEG解码框架，通过模拟视觉处理层次结构，显著提升了EEG视觉解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EEG视觉解码方法依赖扁平神经表征的问题，提出更符合大脑视觉层次结构的解码方法。

Method: ViEEG将视觉刺激分解为三个生物学对齐的组件，并通过三流EEG编码器和跨注意力路由逐步整合特征，模拟视觉皮层信息流。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上，ViEEG在受试者依赖和跨受试者设置中分别达到40.9%和22.9%的Top-1准确率，性能提升超过45%。

Conclusion: ViEEG不仅提升了性能，还为基于生物学的脑解码在AI中设定了新范式。

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a
fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial
intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its
non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution,
existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations
that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we
introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework
that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes
each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour,
foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream
EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via
cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to
the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to
align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object
recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that
ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in
subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings,
surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the
performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded
brain decoding in AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRLoRA通过动态重组低秩子空间提升LoRA的表达能力，不增加可训练参数，在语言和视觉任务中表现优于标准LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的低秩更新限制了表示能力，影响下游性能，需要一种方法在保持轻量化的同时增强表达能力。

Method: SRLoRA基于重要性评分动态融合和重新初始化LoRA对，释放容量以沿未使用的主方向重新初始化新对。

Result: 在GLUE基准和图像分类任务中，SRLoRA实现了更快的收敛和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: SRLoRA是一种高效且通用的PEFT方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method that injects two trainable low-rank matrices (A and
B) into frozen pretrained models. While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a
fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational
capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition
in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and
reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without
compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to
each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically
recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into
the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused
principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value
decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer
adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We
evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark
and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster
convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its
generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.

Motivation: 挑战性能提升必然带来更好内部表征的观点，揭示不同训练方法对网络内部结构的影响。

Method: 比较进化网络和SGD训练网络在简单图像生成任务中的内部表征，通过可视化神经元行为分析差异。

Result: SGD训练网络表现出断裂纠缠表征（FER），而进化网络接近统一分解表征（UFR）。

Conclusion: 理解并缓解FER可能对表征学习的未来发展至关重要，尤其是对泛化、创造力和持续学习能力的提升。

Abstract: Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling
up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance
necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational
optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare
neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks
trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task
of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage:
each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an
image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally
constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks
produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ
dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that
we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved
networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation
(UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like
generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding
and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.

Motivation: 语言序列不足以描述视觉世界的时空细节，而视频序列能更好地捕捉这些信息，因此提出Video-GPT。

Method: 采用下一片段扩散范式，通过自回归去噪历史片段中的噪声片段进行预训练。

Result: 在视频预测任务中表现最优（Physics-IQ Benchmark：Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89），并能适应6种主流视频任务。

Conclusion: Video-GPT在视觉世界建模中表现出色，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However,
the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in
the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such
details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper
by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next
token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for
pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct
paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term
prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean
clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor
towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64
vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in
both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization
capacity in downstream. The project page is at https://Video-GPT.github.io.

Conclusion: WaveFT为极端参数高效场景提供了一种高效解决方案，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with
tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in
few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT
method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual
matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering
fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter
count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme
parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the
wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that
entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on
personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline,
WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low
parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and
image diversity.

Abstract: In robotics applications, few-shot segmentation is crucial because it allows

Abstract: Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem.
Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale
corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric
human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale
datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not
focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect
EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to
date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger
tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated
cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every
joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation
behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks
ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and
systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory
prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring
progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale
dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and
foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动的深度生成模型（如扩散模型）需要大量干净训练数据的问题，以及DIP方法在噪声过拟合和计算效率上的不足。

Method: 提出UGoDIT，通过共享编码器和M个解耦解码器学习可转移权重，测试时固定部分参数并优化其余参数以实现测量一致性。

Result: 在医学和自然图像恢复任务中，UGoDIT显著提升了重建质量和收敛速度，性能接近SOTA方法。

Conclusion: UGoDIT在低数据量下表现出色，为无监督图像重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to
significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models
(e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled
(clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific
settings such as dynamic imaging.
  On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior
(DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise
overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need
to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based
methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number
of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In
this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable
weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of
sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method
learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M
disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image
using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned
weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency.
We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super
resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various
settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides
accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality.
Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and
supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training
data.

TL;DR: DFPIR是一种新型的全能图像修复模型，通过引入退化感知特征扰动（DFP）来调整特征空间，以解决多任务干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同退化类型之间的显著差异，训练一个通用模型时容易产生任务干扰，导致梯度更新方向不一致。

Method: 提出退化感知特征扰动（DFP），包括通道扰动和注意力扰动，通过DGPB模块实现。

Result: 实验表明，DFPIR在多种图像修复任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DFPIR通过特征扰动有效解决了多任务干扰问题，实现了全能图像修复。

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clear images from various
degradation types and levels with a unified model. Nonetheless, the significant
variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal
model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update
directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address
this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel
all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature
Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified
parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include
channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically,
channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in
high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise
perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To
achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB)
to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding
stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing,
image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. Our codes

TL;DR: CoSO提出了一种连续子空间优化方法，通过动态调整子空间来提升持续学习的性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临灾难性遗忘问题，现有低秩适应方法限制了模型的学习能力。

Method: 通过梯度奇异值分解动态确定子空间，正交化历史任务子空间以减少遗忘。

Result: 在长任务序列场景下，CoSO显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoSO通过动态子空间优化有效解决了持续学习中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving
prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when
acquiring new knowledge. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models
have gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong
generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for
new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts
parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the
optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity,
resulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose
Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the
model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential
subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition
of gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these
subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the
optimization subspaces of each task are set to be orthogonal to the historical
task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component
that captures the critical update directions associated with the current task.
Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task
subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task
sequences.

Conclusion: 改进的双流架构通过层间互补性优化，显著提升了反射去除效果和效率。

Abstract: Although dual-stream architectures have achieved remarkable success in single
image reflection removal, they fail to fully exploit inter-layer
complementarity in their physical modeling and network design, which limits the
quality of image separation. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose
two targeted improvements to enhance dual-stream architectures: First, we
introduce a novel inter-layer complementarity model where low-frequency
components extracted from the residual layer interact with the transmission
layer through dual-stream architecture to enhance inter-layer complementarity.
Meanwhile, high-frequency components from the residual layer provide inverse
modulation to both streams, improving the detail quality of the transmission
layer. Second, we propose an efficient inter-layer complementarity attention
mechanism which first cross-reorganizes dual streams at the channel level to
obtain reorganized streams with inter-layer complementary structures, then
performs attention computation on the reorganized streams to achieve better
inter-layer separation, and finally restores the original stream structure for
output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art separation quality on multiple public datasets while
significantly reducing both computational cost and model complexity.

<details>

Motivation: 实验解析的晶体数据稀缺，而电子显微镜图像转换为模拟可用格式的过程繁琐且易错，阻碍了机器学习模型的训练和验证。

Method: AutoMat结合了模式自适应去噪、物理引导模板检索、对称感知原子重建、快速松弛和性质预测，并通过协调各阶段实现闭环推理。

Result: 在450个结构样本的大规模实验中，AutoMat在晶格RMSD、形成能MAE和结构匹配成功率上显著优于现有多模态大语言模型和工具。

Conclusion: AutoMat和STEM2Mat-Bench的提出，为材料科学中显微镜与原子模拟的桥梁搭建迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Machine learning-based interatomic potentials and force fields depend
critically on accurate atomic structures, yet such data are scarce due to the
limited availability of experimentally resolved crystals. Although
atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural
data, converting these images into simulation-ready formats remains
labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a bottleneck for model training and
validation. We introduce AutoMat, an end-to-end, agent-assisted pipeline that
automatically transforms scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
images into atomic crystal structures and predicts their physical properties.
AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval,
symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction
via MatterSim, and coordinated orchestration across all stages. We propose the
first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using
lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By
orchestrating external tool calls, AutoMat enables a text-only LLM to
outperform vision-language models in this domain, achieving closed-loop
reasoning throughout the pipeline. In large-scale experiments over 450
structure samples, AutoMat substantially outperforms existing multimodal large
language models and tools. These results validate both AutoMat and
STEM2Mat-Bench, marking a key step toward bridging microscopy and atomistic
simulation in materials science.The code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: GenZSL是一种基于变分自编码器的生成式零样本学习方法，通过从相似类别中归纳新类别样本，并使用弱类别语义向量（如CLIP文本嵌入）提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式ZSL方法依赖专家标注的强类别语义向量，生成性能有限且场景泛化能力不足。

Method: GenZSL采用类多样性促进和目标类别引导的信息增强策略，优化生成样本的多样性和信息量。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，GenZSL性能显著优于f-VAEGAN（如AWA2上性能提升24.7%，训练速度快60倍）。

Conclusion: GenZSL通过弱语义向量和优化策略，显著提升了生成式ZSL的效能和效率。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using
generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate
(imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic
vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance
and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose
an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed
GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting
new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors
derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the
generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our
GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity
promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it
utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the
model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets
showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy
and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than
$60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2. Codes are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have
significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and
additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although
deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key
challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated
strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2)
common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that
allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the
downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal,
cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address
these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining
framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any"
emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with
any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal
representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across
extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene
mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable
performance to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 高场MRI（HF-MRI）资源有限，而低场MRI（LF-MRI）成本低且更易获取，但现有工具对低分辨率LF-MRI效果不佳。

Method: 使用3D U-Net在合成LF-MRI上训练，预测皮质表面的符号距离函数，并通过几何处理确保拓扑准确性。

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of cortical surfaces from MRI for
morphometric analysis is fundamental for understanding brain structure. While
high-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its
limited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),
particularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible
alternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized
for high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio
and resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method
for 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of
contrasts and resolutions. Our method works "out of the box" without
retraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed
distance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to
ensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI
scans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy
depends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),
orientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted
scan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived
surfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach
Dice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains
more challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of
sub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging
postmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step
toward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域适应场景中，模型在面对分布偏移时的鲁棒性是一个关键挑战。传统的数据增强方法效果有限，而针对特定数据集的增强方法需要专家知识。因此，需要一种无需专家知识且适用于多种数据集的方法。

Method: 提出Frequency-Pixel Connect框架，通过在频率空间和像素空间混合源图像和目标图像的振幅谱和像素内容，生成增强样本，从而引入领域多样性并保留源图像的语义结构。

Result: 在视觉、医学、音频和天文领域的四个真实世界基准测试中，Frequency-Pixel Connect显著提升了跨领域连接性，并优于其他通用方法和针对特定数据集的增强方法。

Conclusion: Frequency-Pixel Connect是一种无需专家知识且适用于多种数据集的领域适应框架，能够有效提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness under domain adaptation settings, where
labeled source data and unlabeled target data come from different
distributions, is a key challenge in real-world applications. A common approach
to improving OOD robustness is through data augmentations. However, in
real-world scenarios, models trained with generic augmentations can only
improve marginally when generalized under distribution shifts toward unlabeled
target domains. While dataset-specific targeted augmentations can address this
issue, they typically require expert knowledge and extensive prior data
analysis to identify the nature of the datasets and domain shift. To address
these challenges, we propose Frequency-Pixel Connect, a domain-adaptation
framework that enhances OOD robustness by introducing a targeted augmentation
in both the frequency space and pixel space. Specifically, we mix the amplitude
spectrum and pixel content of a source image and a target image to generate
augmented samples that introduce domain diversity while preserving the semantic
structure of the source image. Unlike previous targeted augmentation methods
that are both dataset-specific and limited to the pixel space, Frequency-Pixel
Connect is dataset-agnostic, enabling broader and more flexible applicability
beyond natural image datasets. We further analyze the effectiveness of
Frequency-Pixel Connect by evaluating the performance of our method connecting
same-class cross-domain samples while separating different-class examples. We
demonstrate that Frequency-Pixel Connect significantly improves cross-domain
connectivity and outperforms previous generic methods on four diverse
real-world benchmarks across vision, medical, audio, and astronomical domains,
and it also outperforms other dataset-specific targeted augmentation methods.

Conclusion: SFTrack通过慢快结合和知识蒸馏策略，在不同场景下实现了高性能和低延迟的跟踪。

Abstract: Existing tracking algorithms typically rely on low-frame-rate RGB cameras
coupled with computationally intensive deep neural network architectures to
achieve effective tracking. However, such frame-based methods inherently face
challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in
resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired
event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years,
offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we
propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different
operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two
complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with
sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for
latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework
first performs graph-based representation learning from
high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned
graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones,
yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves
low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple
bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine
both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's
performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world
scenarios. The source code has been released on

Abstract: Event-based Vision Sensors (EVS) have demonstrated significant advantages
over traditional RGB frame-based cameras in low-light conditions, high-speed
motion capture, and low latency. Consequently, object detection based on EVS
has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Current event stream
object detection algorithms are typically built upon Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which either capture limited local features
using convolutional filters or incur high computational costs due to the
utilization of self-attention. Recently proposed vision heat conduction
backbone networks have shown a good balance between efficiency and accuracy;
however, these models are not specifically designed for event stream data. They
exhibit weak capability in modeling object contour information and fail to
exploit the benefits of multi-scale features. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a novel dynamic graph induced contour-aware heat conduction
network for event stream based object detection, termed CvHeat-DET. The
proposed model effectively leverages the clear contour information inherent in
event streams to predict the thermal diffusivity coefficients within the heat
conduction model, and integrates hierarchical structural graph features to
enhance feature learning across multiple scales. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets for event stream-based object detection fully validated the
effectiveness of the proposed model. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvDET.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision and deep learning have blurred the line between
deepfakes and authentic media, undermining multimedia credibility through
audio-visual forgery. Current multimodal detection methods remain limited by
unbalanced learning between modalities. To tackle this issue, we propose an
Audio-Visual Joint Learning Method (MACB-DF) to better mitigate modality
conflicts and neglect by leveraging contrastive learning to assist in
multi-level and cross-modal fusion, thereby fully balancing and exploiting
information from each modality. Additionally, we designed an
orthogonalization-multimodal pareto module that preserves unimodal information
while addressing gradient conflicts in audio-video encoders caused by differing
optimization targets of the loss functions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on mainstream deepfake datasets demonstrate consistent
performance gains of our model across key evaluation metrics, achieving an
average accuracy of 95.5% across multiple datasets. Notably, our method
exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization capabilities, with absolute
improvements of 8.0% and 7.7% in ACC scores over the previous best-performing
approach when trained on DFDC and tested on DefakeAVMiT and FakeAVCeleb

Method: 提出Anti-Inpainting方法，包括多级深度特征提取器、多尺度语义保留数据增强和分布偏差优化策略，以提高保护效果和跨条件迁移性。

Result: 实验表明，Anti-Inpainting在InpaintGuardBench和CelebA-HQ数据集上对未知条件下的篡改具有显著防御效果，且对图像净化方法和不同扩散模型版本具有鲁棒性和迁移性。

Conclusion: Anti-Inpainting通过三重机制有效解决了未知条件下的图像保护问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly
prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images
against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only
can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to
protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by
malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive
defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions
through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a
multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features
during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We
design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the
transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by
multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition,
we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to
improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under
diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive
performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by
unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we
also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image
purification methods and its transferability across different versions of
diffusion models.

Abstract: Aiming to generalize the well-trained gaze estimation model to new target
domains, Cross-domain Gaze Estimation (CDGE) is developed for real-world
application scenarios. Existing CDGE methods typically extract the
domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift in feature space, which is
proved insufficient by Generalized Label Shift (GLS) theory. In this paper, we
introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem
by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented
and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting
strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the
continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source
distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a
probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy. Extensive
experiments on standard CDGE tasks with different backbone models validate the
superior generalization capability across domain and applicability on various
models of proposed method.

Motivation: 现有方法在蒸馏高分辨率T2I扩散模型时依赖真实或教师合成图像，且使用CFG导致文本-图像对齐与生成多样性之间的权衡。

Method: 提出Score identity Distillation（SiD）框架，通过匹配所有生成步骤的均匀混合输出到数据分布，避免步长特定网络。引入Diffusion GAN对抗损失和两种新指导策略（Zero-CFG和Anti-CFG）以改善多样性。

Result: 在SD1.5和SDXL上实现了一步和少步生成的最先进性能，且对无真实图像的情况具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SiD框架在高效性和性能上表现优异，为T2I扩散模型的加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation has emerged as a promising strategy for accelerating
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling a pretrained score network
into a one- or few-step generator. While existing methods have made notable
progress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well
when distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion
XL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a
persistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity. We
address these challenges by optimizing Score identity Distillation (SiD) -- a
data-free, one-step distillation framework -- for few-step generation. Backed
by theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs
from all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation
algorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing
pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024
resolution. To mitigate the alignment-diversity trade-off when real text-image
pairs are available, we introduce a Diffusion GAN-based adversarial loss
applied to the uniform mixture and propose two new guidance strategies:
Zero-CFG, which disables CFG in the teacher and removes text conditioning in
the fake score network, and Anti-CFG, which applies negative CFG in the fake
score network. This flexible setup improves diversity without sacrificing
alignment. Comprehensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation settings,
along with robustness to the absence of real images. Our efficient PyTorch
implementation, along with the resulting one- and few-step distilled
generators, will be released publicly as a separate branch at
https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of large models, copyright protection for generated image
content has become a critical security challenge. Although deep learning
watermarking techniques offer an effective solution for digital image copyright
protection, they still face limitations in terms of visual quality, robustness
and generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive
robust iterative watermarking framework (ARIW-Framework) that achieves
high-quality watermarked images while maintaining exceptional robustness and
generalization performance. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach to
optimize the encoder for generating robust residuals. The encoder incorporates
noise layers and a decoder to compute robustness weights for residuals under
various noise attacks. By employing a parallel optimization strategy, the
framework enhances robustness against multiple types of noise attacks.
Furthermore, we leverage image gradients to determine the embedding strength at
each pixel location, significantly improving the visual quality of the
watermarked images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior visual quality while exhibiting remarkable robustness and
generalization against noise attacks.

Result: 发现感知评分在人口统计和人格特质间存在显著差异，现有机器学习模型高估积极指标、低估消极指标。

Conclusion: 研究强调在城市规划和机器学习模型中需考虑本地人口统计和人格特质，以避免偏见。

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning
decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and
multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking
amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of
streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics --
including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the
first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants,
with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This
dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics
(SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in
six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring,
and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green)
among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based
sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban
streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores
based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an
off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception
dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative
ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should
consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment
of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality
traits.

TL;DR: GradMix是一种数据增强方法，通过梯度归因图动态屏蔽已学概念，以促进模型学习更多样化的特征，提升开放集识别、闭集分类和分布外检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别（OSR）旨在检测模型推理中的新类别，但现有模型仍难以从未见类别中学习相关特征。

Method: 提出GradMix，利用梯度归因图在训练中动态屏蔽已学概念，鼓励模型从同一数据源学习更全面的代表性特征。

Result: 实验表明，GradMix在开放集识别、闭集分类和分布外检测中优于现有方法，并提升模型鲁棒性和自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: GradMix通过优化特征学习，显著提升模型泛化能力，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) is devised to address the problem of detecting
novel classes during model inference. Even in recent vision models, this
remains an open issue which is receiving increasing attention. Thereby, a
crucial challenge is to learn features that are relevant for unseen categories
from given data, for which these features might not be discriminative. To
facilitate this process and "optimize to learn" more diverse features, we
propose GradMix, a data augmentation method that dynamically leverages
gradient-based attribution maps of the model during training to mask out
already learned concepts. Thus GradMix encourages the model to learn a more
complete set of representative features from the same data source. Extensive
experiments on open set recognition, close set classification, and
out-of-distribution detection reveal that our method can often outperform the
state-of-the-art. GradMix can further increase model robustness to corruptions
as well as downstream classification performance for self-supervised learning,
indicating its benefit for model generalization.

TL;DR: PI-VAD是一种多模态增强的弱监督视频异常检测方法，通过引入五种额外模态（如姿态、深度、全景掩码、光流和语言线索）来提升RGB特征的区分能力，无需在推理阶段使用多模态骨干网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB特征在区分复杂真实场景中的异常事件（如商店盗窃）时表现不足，因此需要引入多模态信息以提高检测的鲁棒性。

Method: PI-VAD通过伪模态生成模块和跨模态诱导模块，将五种额外模态的信息融入RGB特征，同时仅需在训练阶段使用多模态骨干网络。

Result: PI-VAD在三个真实场景的VAD数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，且推理阶段无需多模态骨干网络。

Conclusion: 多模态增强显著提升了视频异常检测的鲁棒性，PI-VAD为复杂场景下的VAD提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are
conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to
limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that
RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such
as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex
real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by
additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced
framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations
by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity
to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity
representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion
(optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an
axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two
plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal
Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation
and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules
operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five
modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing
real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five
modality backbones at inference.

Motivation: 图像退化（如雨、雾、光照等）影响计算机视觉任务的性能，现有修复方法无法满足实时处理需求。

Method: 利用ResNet_50进行迁移学习，开发能自动识别图像退化类型并选择修复方法的模型。

Result: 模型具有灵活性和可扩展性，适用于实时视频监控。

Conclusion: 该研究为实时图像修复提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: One of the major challenges in the field of computer vision especially for
detection, segmentation, recognition, monitoring, and automated solutions, is
the quality of images. Image degradation, often caused by factors such as rain,
fog, lighting, etc., has a negative impact on automated
decision-making.Furthermore, several image restoration solutions exist,
including restoration models for single degradation and restoration models for
multiple degradations. However, these solutions are not suitable for real-time
processing. In this study, the aim was to develop a real-time image restoration
solution for video surveillance. To achieve this, using transfer learning with
ResNet_50, we developed a model for automatically identifying the types of
degradation present in an image to reference the necessary treatment(s) for
image restoration. Our solution has the advantage of being flexible and
scalable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型硬注意力模型MRAM，通过模拟人类视觉神经层次结构，解决了现有模型在注意力动态上的不足，并在图像分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬注意力模型（如RAM和DRAM）未能模拟人类视觉系统的层次结构，导致注意力动态不自然（过于固定或过度扫视）。

Method: 提出多级循环注意力模型（MRAM），通过两个循环层分别处理注视位置生成和任务执行，实现注视与扫视的平衡。

Result: MRAM不仅表现出更接近人类眼动的注意力动态，还在标准图像分类任务中优于CNN、RAM和DRAM基线模型。

Conclusion: MRAM通过模拟人类视觉层次结构，实现了更自然的注意力动态和更好的任务性能。

Abstract: Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and
parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual
Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the
hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration
dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly
fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior.
In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a
novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of
human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location
generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced
behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not
only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently
outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification
benchmarks.

TL;DR: CoFF提出了一种跨模态特征融合方法，结合点云几何和RGB图像信息，显著提升了点云配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略RGB图像的辐射信息，导致在几何数据不足的区域配准效果不佳。

Method: CoFF通过两阶段融合3D点云和2D图像特征，包括像素级和块级特征融合，以及粗到细的匹配模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如3DMatch和3DLoMatch上分别达到95.9%和81.6%的配准召回率。

Conclusion: CoFF通过跨模态特征融合，显著提升了点云配准性能，尤其在几何模糊区域表现突出。

Abstract: Point cloud registration has seen significant advancements with the
application of deep learning techniques. However, existing approaches often
overlook the potential of integrating radiometric information from RGB images.
This limitation reduces their effectiveness in aligning point clouds pairs,
especially in regions where geometric data alone is insufficient. When used
effectively, radiometric information can enhance the registration process by
providing context that is missing from purely geometric data. In this paper, we
propose CoFF, a novel Cross-modal Feature Fusion method that utilizes both
point cloud geometry and RGB images for pairwise point cloud registration.
Assuming that the co-registration between point clouds and RGB images is
available, CoFF explicitly addresses the challenges where geometric information
alone is unclear, such as in regions with symmetric similarity or planar
structures, through a two-stage fusion of 3D point cloud features and 2D image
features. It incorporates a cross-modal feature fusion module that assigns
pixel-wise image features to 3D input point clouds to enhance learned 3D point
features, and integrates patch-wise image features with superpoint features to
improve the quality of coarse matching. This is followed by a coarse-to-fine
matching module that accurately establishes correspondences using the fused
features. We extensively evaluate CoFF on four common datasets: 3DMatch,
3DLoMatch, IndoorLRS, and the recently released ScanNet++ datasets. In
addition, we assess CoFF on specific subset datasets containing geometrically
ambiguous cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoFF achieves
state-of-the-art registration performance across all benchmarks, including
remarkable registration recalls of 95.9% and 81.6% on the widely-used 3DMatch
and 3DLoMatch datasets, respectively...(Truncated to fit arXiv abstract length)

Result: 在ShapeNet和ModelNet40上的实验表明，该方法在低比特率下优于标准化和最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DDPM-PCC在低比特率下实现了更好的率失真性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: Efficient compression of low-bit-rate point clouds is critical for
bandwidth-constrained applications. However, existing techniques mainly focus
on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This
paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture
for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder
produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a
learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates
while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved
rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art
approaches. We publicly released the code at

<details>

Motivation: 人类能快速从单一样本中泛化手写风格，而机器在低数据量下难以捕捉细微的空间和风格线索。WriteViT旨在填补这一差距。

Method: WriteViT结合了ViT-based Writer Identifier提取风格嵌入、多尺度生成器（Transformer编码器-解码器块增强条件位置编码）和轻量级ViT-based识别器。

Result: 在越南语和英语数据集上，WriteViT生成了高质量且风格一致的手写文本，同时在低资源场景下保持了较强的识别性能。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的设计在多语言手写生成和高效风格适应方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Humans can quickly generalize handwriting styles from a single example by
intuitively separating content from style. Machines, however, struggle with
this task, especially in low-data settings, often missing subtle spatial and
stylistic cues. Motivated by this gap, we introduce WriteViT, a one-shot
handwritten text synthesis framework that incorporates Vision Transformers
(ViT), a family of models that have shown strong performance across various
computer vision tasks. WriteViT integrates a ViT-based Writer Identifier for
extracting style embeddings, a multi-scale generator built with Transformer
encoder-decoder blocks enhanced by conditional positional encoding (CPE), and a
lightweight ViT-based recognizer. While previous methods typically rely on CNNs
or CRNNs, our design leverages transformers in key components to better capture
both fine-grained stroke details and higher-level style information. Although
handwritten text synthesis has been widely explored, its application to
Vietnamese -- a language rich in diacritics and complex typography -- remains
limited. Experiments on Vietnamese and English datasets demonstrate that
WriteViT produces high-quality, style-consistent handwriting while maintaining
strong recognition performance in low-resource scenarios. These results
highlight the promise of transformer-based designs for multilingual handwriting
generation and efficient style adaptation.

Motivation: 现有视频运动迁移方法通常需要复杂训练，RoPECraft旨在通过直接修改RoPE实现高效且无需训练的运动迁移。

Method: 提取参考视频的光流，利用运动偏移扭曲RoPE的复数张量，通过流匹配目标优化嵌入，并引入基于傅里叶变换相位的正则化项。

Result: 实验表明，RoPECraft在定性和定量上均优于近期发表的其他方法。

Conclusion: RoPECraft通过直接操作RoPE实现了高效且无需训练的视频运动迁移，性能优越。

Abstract: We propose RoPECraft, a training-free video motion transfer method for
diffusion transformers that operates solely by modifying their rotary
positional embeddings (RoPE). We first extract dense optical flow from a
reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the
complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the
generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during
denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target
velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the
text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization
term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform,
projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency
artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all
recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning,
yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a
significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language

vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation
autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate
geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis.
Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our
technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete
representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections
preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous'
methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code, data, and trained

Conclusion: FinePhys通过结合数据驱动和物理方法，有效解决了细粒度人类动作生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically
plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in
modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance,
generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses
substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory
results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action
generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal
guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner
and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To
mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D
poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module
governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via
bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then
fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the
diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym
(FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms
competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate
FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human
actions.

<details>

Motivation: 当前离散VT在图像重建和细节保留上表现不佳，缺乏专门评估VT性能的基准，因此提出VTBench填补这一空白。

Method: 通过VTBench评估多种VT，使用图像重建、细节保留和文本保留任务，并采用多种指标量化性能。

Result: 连续VAE在视觉表示上优于离散VT，尤其在保留空间结构和语义细节方面；离散VT易导致图像失真和细节丢失。

Conclusion: VTBench为VT研究提供了新工具，呼吁开发更强大的开源VT，并探讨了GPT-4o的潜在AR特性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image
generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps
continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT
largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current
discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders
(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of
details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,
without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core
tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and
covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess
state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of
reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior
visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining
spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded
representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted
reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text
and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image
generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the
role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to
support further research and call on the community to develop strong,
general-purpose open-source VTs.

Abstract: The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to
organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine
learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for
such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to
structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing
interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components,
in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide
substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness
of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the
analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark
for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the
retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their
impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far
outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval
over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across
various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark
variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks. TARGET is

### [679] [GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552)
*Ahmad Bin Rabiah,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GSPRec是一种图谱模型，通过时序增强的图构建和频域感知过滤改进推荐系统，解决了传统方法对低通滤波的过度依赖和时序动态忽略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统过度依赖低通滤波（抑制用户特定信号）且忽略时序动态，导致性能受限。

Method: GSPRec通过时序增强的图构建和多跳扩散编码项目转移，结合高斯带通滤波（提取用户级模式）和低通滤波（保留全局趋势）。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，GSPRec平均NDCG@10提升6.77%，验证了时序图增强和带通滤波的互补优势。

Conclusion: GSPRec通过结合时序动态和频域过滤，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative
patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass
filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential
dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model
that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph
construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain.
GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of
symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we
design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract
mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global
trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec
consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in
NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential
graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.

*Lee Harris,Philippe De Wilde,James Bentham*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 传统词法向量搜索在结构化医学文档分类中优于语义向量搜索，速度和准确性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语义向量搜索是否总是最佳解决方案，尤其是在结构化医学文档分类任务中。

Method: 比较了现成的语义向量搜索和自定义的词法向量搜索模型在分类任务中的表现。

Result: 词法向量搜索在预测准确性和执行速度上优于语义向量搜索。

Conclusion: 传统方法在信息检索中仍具竞争力，不应被忽视。

Abstract: Classification is a common AI problem, and vector search is a typical
solution. This transforms a given body of text into a numerical representation,
known as an embedding, and modern improvements to vector search focus on
optimising speed and predictive accuracy. This is often achieved through neural
methods that aim to learn language semantics. However, our results suggest that
these are not always the best solution. Our task was to classify
rigidly-structured medical documents according to their content, and we found
that using off-the-shelf semantic vector search produced slightly worse
predictive accuracy than creating a bespoke lexical vector search model, and
that it required significantly more time to execute. These findings suggest
that traditional methods deserve to be contenders in the information retrieval
toolkit, despite the prevalence and success of neural models.

Mining, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). Furthermore, sophisticated voice recognition
technologies, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) algorithms, play a crucial role in accurate speech-to-text conversion,
ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. The methodology
incorporates a fusion of content-based and collaborative recommendation
approaches, enhancing them with NLP techniques. This innovative integration
ensures a more personalized and context-aware recommendation experience,
particularly in marketing applications.

### [684] [LightRetriever: A LLM-based Hybrid Retrieval Architecture with 1000x Faster Query Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260)
*Guangyuan Ma,Yongliang Ma,Xuanrui Gou,Zhenpeng Su,Ming Zhou,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightRetriever是一种基于LLM的混合检索器，通过极轻量级的查询编码器显著提升查询推理速度，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM显著提升了检索能力，但其深度参数化导致查询推理速度下降，在线部署资源需求增加。

Method: 保留完整大小的LLM用于文档编码，但将查询编码的工作量减少到不超过嵌入查找。

Result: 在H800 GPU上实现了1000倍以上的查询推理加速，无GPU时也有20倍加速，性能保持95%以上。

Conclusion: LightRetriever在保持高性能的同时，显著提升了查询效率，适用于多样化检索任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode
queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse
vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector
similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in
real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs
significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs
slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online
deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel
LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our
method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload
of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a
full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for
query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU.
Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method
generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95%
full-sized performance.

TL;DR: 本文比较研究了联邦在线学习排序（FOLTR）中联邦遗忘策略的有效性和效率，重点关注如何系统且可验证地分析遗忘能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦排序方法因隐私保护需求受到关注，但现有遗忘方法仅使用单一评估指标，无法全面评估遗忘效果。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究通过适应和新提出的评估指标，严格评估五种遗忘策略在欠遗忘和过遗忘场景中的有效性。

Result: 详细分析揭示了五种遗忘策略的优势和局限性，为优化联邦遗忘提供了宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡FOLTR中数据隐私和系统性能提供了优化方向，并公开了代码和完整结果。

Abstract: This paper reports on findings from a comparative study on the effectiveness
and efficiency of federated unlearning strategies within Federated Online
Learning to Rank (FOLTR), with specific attention to systematically analysing
the unlearning capabilities of methods in a verifiable manner.
  Federated approaches to ranking of search results have recently garnered
attention to address users privacy concerns. In FOLTR, privacy is safeguarded
by collaboratively training ranking models across decentralized data sources,
preserving individual user data while optimizing search results based on
implicit feedback, such as clicks.
  Recent legislation introduced across numerous countries is establishing the
so called "the right to be forgotten", according to which services based on
machine learning models like those in FOLTR should provide capabilities that
allow users to remove their own data from those used to train models. This has
sparked the development of unlearning methods, along with evaluation practices
to measure whether unlearning of a user data successfully occurred. Current
evaluation practices are however often controversial, necessitating the use of
multiple metrics for a more comprehensive assessment -- but previous proposals
of unlearning methods only used single evaluation metrics.
  This paper addresses this limitation: our study rigorously assesses the
effectiveness of unlearning strategies in managing both under-unlearning and
over-unlearning scenarios using adapted, and newly proposed evaluation metrics.
Thanks to our detailed analysis, we uncover the strengths and limitations of
five unlearning strategies, offering valuable insights into optimizing
federated unlearning to balance data privacy and system performance within
FOLTR. We publicly release our code and complete results at
https://github.com/Iris1026/Unlearning-for-FOLTR.git.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将机器学习（ML）引入两阶段最小二乘法（2SLS）的影响，分析了ML在2SLS中的适用性及其可能带来的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2SLS的第一阶段是一个预测问题，而ML擅长解决预测问题，但缺乏关于ML在2SLS中何时有益或有害的指导。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分解偏差为三个组成部分，研究了ML在2SLS中的表现，并通过模拟实验验证了线性ML方法（如后Lasso）和非线性ML方法（如随机森林、神经网络）的效果。

Result: 线性ML方法表现良好，而非线性ML方法在第二阶段估计中可能产生显著偏差，甚至超过内生OLS的偏差。

Conclusion: 在2SLS中使用ML时，线性方法更为可靠，而非线性方法需谨慎使用以避免偏差。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) primarily evolved to solve "prediction problems." The
first stage of two-stage least squares (2SLS) is a prediction problem,
suggesting potential gains from ML first-stage assistance. However, little
guidance exists on when ML helps 2SLS$\unicode{x2014}$or when it hurts. We
investigate the implications of inserting ML into 2SLS, decomposing the bias
into three informative components. Mechanically, ML-in-2SLS procedures face
issues common to prediction and causal-inference settings$\unicode{x2014}$and
their interaction. Through simulation, we show linear ML methods (e.g.,
post-Lasso) work well, while nonlinear methods (e.g., random forests, neural
nets) generate substantial bias in second-stage
estimates$\unicode{x2014}$potentially exceeding the bias of endogenous OLS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，人们对未来收益的模糊知识难以量化，而语言在传达这种模糊信息中扮演了重要但未被充分认识的角色。

Method: 通过分析分析师报告中的文本语气和数值预测，研究其对预测误差和修订的影响。

Result: 文本语气对预测误差和修订有预测能力，且在语言更模糊、不确定性更高或分析师更忙时效果更强。

Conclusion: 研究表明，部分有用信息仅通过语言模糊传达，语言在主观预期中具有重要作用。

Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for
which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with
differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less
known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their
reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not
numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has
predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical
forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is
vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our
theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and
only communicated through language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如Charikar的贪心算法虽然高效但精度有限，而精确解计算复杂。学习增强算法结合机器学习预测，旨在提升性能。

Method: 利用机器学习分类器提供的部分解，设计了一种线性时间算法，实现接近最优的近似解。

Result: 实验证明，该算法在Twitch Ego Nets数据集上优于Charikar贪心算法和直接返回预测结果的基线方法。

Conclusion: 学习增强算法为最密子图问题提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案，适用于多种变体。

Abstract: We study the densest subgraph problem and its variants through the lens of
learning-augmented algorithms. For this problem, the greedy algorithm by
Charikar (APPROX 2000) provides a linear-time $ 1/2 $-approximation, while
computing the exact solution typically requires solving a linear program or
performing maximum flow computations.We show that given a partial solution,
i.e., one produced by a machine learning classifier that captures at least a $
(1 - \epsilon) $-fraction of nodes in the optimal subgraph, it is possible to
design an extremely simple linear-time algorithm that achieves a provable $ (1
- \epsilon) $-approximation. Our approach also naturally extends to the
directed densest subgraph problem and several NP-hard variants.An experiment on
the Twitch Ego Nets dataset shows that our learning-augmented algorithm
outperforms Charikar's greedy algorithm and a baseline that directly returns
the predicted densest subgraph without additional algorithmic processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算的快速发展及其基础设施的复杂性增加，需要实时检测和缓解故障的智能机制。传统方法难以应对现代云环境的规模和动态性。

Method: 结合机器学习故障检测算法和LLM的自然语言理解能力，通过语义上下文处理系统日志、错误报告和实时数据流。采用多级架构，结合监督学习进行故障分类和无监督学习进行异常检测。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在故障检测准确性、系统停机时间减少和恢复速度方面显著优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 提出的AI框架为云系统提供了一种高效的智能故障检测和自愈解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud computing systems and the increasing
complexity of their infrastructure, intelligent mechanisms to detect and
mitigate failures in real time are becoming increasingly important. Traditional
methods of failure detection are often difficult to cope with the scale and
dynamics of modern cloud environments. In this study, we propose a novel AI
framework based on Massive Language Model (LLM) for intelligent fault detection
and self-healing mechanisms in cloud systems. The model combines existing
machine learning fault detection algorithms with LLM's natural language
understanding capabilities to process and parse system logs, error reports, and
real-time data streams through semantic context. The method adopts a
multi-level architecture, combined with supervised learning for fault
classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, so that the
system can predict potential failures before they occur and automatically
trigger the self-healing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed
model is significantly better than the traditional fault detection system in
terms of fault detection accuracy, system downtime reduction and recovery
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始HLM存在通信开销大和资源浪费的问题，需要改进以提高效率。

Method: 提出CU-HLM，SLM仅在不确定性高时传输截断词汇分布，并理论推导最优不确定性阈值和截断策略。

Result: CU-HLM比标准HLM提高了206倍的令牌吞吐量，跳过74.8%的传输并压缩97.4%的词汇，同时保持97.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: CU-HLM显著提升了混合语言模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and
heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a
promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates
draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model
(LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication
overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary
distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation
resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be
accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and
uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated
vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate
the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong
correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability.
Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal
vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to
standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by
skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while
maintaining 97.4% accuracy.

TL;DR: ZenFlow是一种新型的卸载框架，通过优先处理重要参数并解耦GPU和CPU的更新，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卸载训练框架（如ZeRO-Offload）对所有参数一视同仁，导致GPU因等待CPU更新而闲置，效率低下。

Method: ZenFlow通过异步卸载和累积不太重要的梯度，同时在GPU上就地更新重要梯度，完全重叠CPU和GPU的工作。此外，引入轻量级梯度选择方法，利用梯度的时空局部性避免全局同步。

Result: ZenFlow实现了端到端5倍加速，PCIe流量降低2倍，GPU闲置时间减少85%，同时保持模型准确性。

Conclusion: ZenFlow通过优化参数更新策略和梯度选择方法，显著提升了大型语言模型微调的效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often exceeds GPU memory limits,
prompting systems to offload model states to CPU memory. However, existing
offloaded training frameworks like ZeRO-Offload treat all parameters equally
and update the full model on the CPU, causing severe GPU stalls, where fast,
expensive GPUs sit idle waiting for slow CPU updates and limited-bandwidth PCIe
transfers.
  We present ZenFlow, a new offloading framework that prioritizes important
parameters and decouples updates between GPU and CPU. ZenFlow performs in-place
updates of important gradients on GPU, while asynchronously offloading and
accumulating less important ones on CPU, fully overlapping CPU work with GPU
computation.
  To scale across GPUs, ZenFlow introduces a lightweight gradient selection
method that exploits a novel spatial and temporal locality property of
important gradients, avoiding costly global synchronization. ZenFlow achieves
up to 5x end-to-end speedup, 2x lower PCIe traffic, and reduces GPU stalls by
over 85 percent, all while preserving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI集群中频繁的节点和链路变化会干扰分布式训练，而传统的基于检查点的恢复和云中心自动扩展速度慢且不适合边缘环境。

Method: Chaos采用多邻居复制和快速分片调度加速扩展，通过集群监控跟踪资源变化，并通过对等协商协议处理扩展事件。

Result: 实验表明，Chaos的扩展延迟显著低于Pollux、EDL和Autoscaling，并能在一毫秒内处理节点加入、退出和故障。

Conclusion: Chaos在资源利用和可扩展性方面表现优异，适用于边缘环境。

Abstract: Frequent node and link changes in edge AI clusters disrupt distributed
training, while traditional checkpoint-based recovery and cloud-centric
autoscaling are too slow for scale-out and ill-suited to chaotic and
self-governed edge. This paper proposes Chaos, a resilient and scalable edge
distributed training system with built-in self-healing and autoscaling. It
speeds up scale-out by using multi-neighbor replication with fast shard
scheduling, allowing a new node to pull the latest training state from nearby
neighbors in parallel while balancing the traffic load between them. It also
uses a cluster monitor to track resource and topology changes to assist
scheduler decisions, and handles scaling events through peer negotiation
protocols, enabling fully self-governed autoscaling without a central admin.
Extensive experiments show that Chaos consistently achieves much lower
scale-out delays than Pollux, EDL, and Autoscaling, and handles scale-in,
connect-link, and disconnect-link events within 1 millisecond, making it
smoother to handle node joins, exits, and failures. It also delivers the lowest
idle time, showing superior resource use and scalability as the cluster grows.

Method: CMFusion结合预训练模型提取文本、音频和视频特征，使用时序交叉注意力机制捕捉模态依赖，并通过通道和模态融合模块生成视频表征。

Conclusion: CMFusion通过有效整合多模态特征和时序动态，显著提升了仇恨视频检测性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: The rapid rise of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has
transformed information dissemination, but it has also facilitated the spread
of harmful content, particularly hate videos. Despite significant efforts to
combat hate speech, detecting these videos remains challenging due to their
often implicit nature. Current detection methods primarily rely on unimodal
approaches, which inadequately capture the complementary features across
different modalities. While multimodal techniques offer a broader perspective,
many fail to effectively integrate temporal dynamics and modality-wise
interactions essential for identifying nuanced hate content. In this paper, we
present CMFusion, an enhanced multimodal hate video detection model utilizing a
novel Channel-wise and Modality-wise Fusion Mechanism. CMFusion first extracts
features from text, audio, and video modalities using pre-trained models and
then incorporates a temporal cross-attention mechanism to capture dependencies
between video and audio streams. The learned features are then processed by
channel-wise and modality-wise fusion modules to obtain informative
representations of videos. Our extensive experiments on a real-world dataset
demonstrate that CMFusion significantly outperforms five widely used baselines
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Comprehensive ablation
studies and parameter analyses further validate our design choices,
highlighting the model's effectiveness in detecting hate videos. The source
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/EvelynZ10/cmfusion.

Motivation: 光子神经网络（PNNs）具有高并行性和低功耗的优势，但其可扩展性问题限制了商业化应用。解决这一问题对实现光子AI模型的可行性至关重要。

Method: 通过可编程超表面技术，结合电子集成、3D堆叠和大规模制造，提升PNNs的可扩展性和功能。

Result: 可编程超表面技术有望解决PNNs当前面临的挑战，推动下一代光子AI技术的发展。

Conclusion: 可编程超表面技术是实现可扩展光子AI加速器的关键，具备与数字电子技术竞争的潜力。

Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs), which share the inherent benefits of
photonic systems, such as high parallelism and low power consumption, could
challenge traditional digital neural networks in terms of energy efficiency,
latency, and throughput. However, producing scalable photonic artificial
intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models
viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models
implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical
computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this
Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may
become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators
and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies.
Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware,
enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that
require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D

Abstract: Neural networks are powerful tools for data-driven modeling of complex
dynamical systems, enhancing predictive capability for control applications.
However, their inherent nonlinearity and black-box nature challenge control
designs that prioritize rigorous safety and recursive feasibility guarantees.
This paper presents algorithmic methods for synthesizing control invariant sets
specifically tailored to neural network based dynamical models. These
algorithms employ set recursion, ensuring termination after a finite number of
iterations and generating subsets in which closed-loop dynamics are forward
invariant, thus guaranteeing perpetual operational safety. Additionally, we
propose model predictive control designs that integrate these control invariant
sets into mixed-integer optimization, with guaranteed adherence to safety
constraints and recursive feasibility at the computational level. We also
present a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the properties and
guarantees of the proposed methods. Numerical simulations in an autonomous
driving scenario demonstrate the methods' effectiveness in synthesizing
control-invariant sets offline and implementing model predictive control
online, ensuring safety and recursive feasibility.

Conclusion: 结合GNN和RL的功率分配方法在D2D通信中表现出色，为延迟优化和公平性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently
encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper
addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for
delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement
learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach
incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet
delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets
into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method,
where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The
central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the
communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we
embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm.
This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the
state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is
leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay
while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits
scalability and generalization capability.

TL;DR: 本文提出LAMeTA，一种基于大型AI模型的两阶段方法，用于优化意图感知的代理网络。通过意图导向的知识蒸馏和共生强化学习，显著提升了意图预测和服务质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI发展为能够推理和协作的自主代理，其在网络基础设施上的部署带来了新的优化挑战，传统深度强化学习难以动态调整策略以适应用户意图。

Method: 1. 意图导向知识蒸馏（IoKD）将意图理解能力从资源密集型大型AI模型迁移到轻量级边缘模型（E-LAMs）；2. 共生强化学习（SRL）将E-LAMs与基于策略的深度强化学习框架结合，动态优化服务链和E-LAM选择。

Result: 实验表明，IoKD将意图预测的均方误差降低22.5%，SRL在最大化意图感知QoE方面比传统深度强化学习提升23.5%。

Conclusion: LAMeTA通过结合意图理解和动态策略优化，显著提升了代理网络的性能和服务质量。

Abstract: Nowadays, Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes numerous domains by enabling
machines to create content across modalities. As GenAI evolves into autonomous
agents capable of reasoning, collaboration, and interaction, they are
increasingly deployed on network infrastructures to serve humans automatically.
This emerging paradigm, known as the agentic network, presents new optimization
challenges due to the demand to incorporate subjective intents of human users
expressed in natural language. Traditional generic Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) struggles to capture intent semantics and adjust policies dynamically,
thus leading to suboptimality. In this paper, we present LAMeTA, a Large AI
Model (LAM)-empowered Two-stage Approach for intent-aware agentic network
optimization. First, we propose Intent-oriented Knowledge Distillation (IoKD),
which efficiently distills intent-understanding capabilities from
resource-intensive LAMs to lightweight edge LAMs (E-LAMs) to serve end users.
Second, we develop Symbiotic Reinforcement Learning (SRL), integrating E-LAMs
with a policy-based DRL framework. In SRL, E-LAMs translate natural language
user intents into structured preference vectors that guide both state
representation and reward design. The DRL, in turn, optimizes the generative
service function chain composition and E-LAM selection based on real-time
network conditions, thus optimizing the subjective Quality-of-Experience (QoE).
Extensive experiments conducted in an agentic network with 81 agents
demonstrate that IoKD reduces mean squared error in intent prediction by up to
22.5%, while SRL outperforms conventional generic DRL by up to 23.5% in
maximizing intent-aware QoE.

Abstract: The 6G mobile network is the next evolutionary step after 5G, with a
prediction of an explosive surge in mobile traffic. It provides ultra-low
latency, higher data rates, high device density, and ubiquitous coverage,
positively impacting services in various areas. Energy saving is a major
concern for new systems in the telecommunications sector because all players
are expected to reduce their carbon footprints to contribute to mitigating
climate change. Network slicing is a fundamental enabler for 6G/5G mobile
networks and various other new systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT),
Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and Industrial IoT (IIoT). However, energy-saving
methods embedded in network slicing architectures are still a research gap.
This paper discusses how to embed energy-saving methods in network-slicing
architectures that are a fundamental enabler for nearly all new innovative
systems being deployed worldwide. This paper's main contribution is a proposal
to save energy in network slicing. That is achieved by deploying ML-native
agents in NS architectures to dynamically orchestrate and optimize resources
based on user demands. The SFI2 network slicing reference architecture is the
concrete use case scenario in which contrastive learning improves energy saving
for resource allocation.

Abstract: Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how
linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid
quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent
advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding
entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying
some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these
ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting
large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of
pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and
quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach
enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse
relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments)
to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part
of the augmented open-source quantum NLP package lambeq Gen II.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析digest2参数和机器学习方法，显著减少了NEOCP中非近地天体的误报率，同时保持了近地天体的高发现率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来近地天体（NEO）发现数量大幅增加，但NEOCP中约一半的候选天体最终被确认为非NEO，浪费了大量观测资源。

Method: 分析了30种digest2参数类别，并应用四种机器学习技术（GBM、RF、SGD、NN）对NEOCP候选进行分类。

Result: 结合digest2参数过滤和机器学习模型，非NEO误报率减少超过80%，NEO发现率损失仅为5.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了NEOCP的效率，减少了资源浪费，同时保持了高NEO发现率。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates
of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between
2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the
inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in
near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the
NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing
time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the
candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are
insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives
and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for
NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30
distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as
NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based
on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs
from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also
investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is,
the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to
classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as
input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in
distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2
parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a
significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting
the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most
follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly
identified as NEOs.

Conclusion: 本文为无限维数据生成提供了理论框架，并通过球面随机场的实例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We adopt a Gamma and Malliavin Calculi point of view in order to generalize
Score-based diffusion Generative Models (SGMs) to an infinite-dimensional
abstract Hilbertian setting. Particularly, we define the forward noising
process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of
Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract
time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin
derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to
generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend
existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian
setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the
Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion
for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern

Result: 剪枝后的模型仅需一次微调即可恢复85%性能，收敛速度比从头训练快36倍。

Conclusion: SepPrune在语音分离模型的通道剪枝中表现出显著优势，适用于高效实时应用。

Abstract: Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent
years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while
overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency
speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose
SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to
compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost.
SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to
identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a
differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection.
Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes
the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages
for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing
methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the
performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than
training from scratch. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于特定领域（如声音、音乐或语音），MMAR扩展至更广泛的现实音频场景，并推动音频推理研究。

Method: MMAR通过分层分类（信号、感知、语义、文化）和链式思维（CoT）标注问题，要求多步深度推理，部分问题需研究生级知识。

Result: 测试了多种模型（如LALMs、LARMs、LLMs等），结果显示当前模型在理解和推理能力上存在显著局限。

Conclusion: MMAR有望推动音频推理领域的未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning
capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary
tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer
triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through
iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike
existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or
speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios,
including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each
question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers:
Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories
within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster
research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the
benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding.
Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and
domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We
evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language
Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models
(OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with
audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the
benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical
limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models.
We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but
little-explored area.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: VoiceCloak是一种针对扩散模型（DMs）的多维主动防御框架，旨在通过对抗性扰动破坏未经授权的语音克隆（VC），同时模糊说话人身份并降低感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语音克隆中表现出色，但也增加了恶意滥用的风险。传统防御方法不适用于扩散模型，因此需要开发新的防御机制。

Method: VoiceCloak通过分析扩散模型的漏洞，引入对抗性扰动，模糊说话人身份（通过扭曲表示学习嵌入）并破坏关键条件引导过程（如注意力上下文）。此外，通过分数幅度放大和噪声引导的语义破坏，降低输出质量。

Result: 实验表明，VoiceCloak在防御基于扩散模型的未经授权语音克隆方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VoiceCloak为扩散模型提供了一种有效的主动防御解决方案，能够显著降低语音克隆的滥用风险。

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice
cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing
proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the
forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the
intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of
obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential
unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to
identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt
the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference
audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets
speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize
identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles.
Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes,
particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal
characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to
address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude
amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation
of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to
disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality.
Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate
against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak

*Abhinaba Roy,Geeta Puri,Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Text2midi-InferAlign是一种在推理时改进符号音乐生成的新技术，通过文本-音频对齐和音乐结构对齐奖励，使生成的音乐更符合输入描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升符号音乐生成的质量和连贯性，使其更贴近输入文本描述。

Method: 引入两个目标分数：文本-音频一致性分数（衡量生成音乐与文本描述的节奏对齐）和和声一致性分数（惩罚与调性不一致的音符），在生成过程中优化这些对齐目标。

Result: 在Text2midi模型基础上显著提升了客观和主观评价指标。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练或微调，可扩展至任何自回归模型，有效提升生成音乐的质量和一致性。

Abstract: We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic
music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio
alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage
the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we
introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures
rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption,
and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing
notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives
during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more
closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and
coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing
autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We
evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation
model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective
evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的地理上下文声景到景观生成方法（GeoS2L），通过结合地理知识生成地理一致的景观图像，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频到图像生成方法忽视地理和环境上下文，导致生成图像与现实环境不符，因此需要一种结合地理知识的框架。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散变换器（DiT）的模型SounDiT，并构建了两个大规模地理上下文多模态数据集SoundingSVI和SonicUrban。

Result: SounDiT在视觉保真度和地理一致性上优于基线方法，并通过Place Similarity Score（PSS）验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为GeoS2L生成奠定了基础，强调了地理知识在多模态生成模型中的重要性，为生成AI与地理、城市规划等领域的交叉研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel and practically significant problem-Geo-Contextual
Soundscape-to-Landscape (GeoS2L) generation-which aims to synthesize
geographically realistic landscape images from environmental soundscapes. Prior
audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets
and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic
images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework
that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative
modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets,
SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world
landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based
model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize
geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a
practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity
Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure
consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both
visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes
foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the
importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal
generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI,
geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.

Conclusion: OZSpeech通过创新的流匹配和单步采样方法，显著提升了TTS系统的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent
years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network
architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous
approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms
or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods
have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring
high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during
training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS
method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step
sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding
preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach
operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format,
enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS
system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results
show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in
content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style
preservation. Audio samples are available at our demo page

Motivation: 过去的多模态音乐翻译研究通常针对单一任务训练专用模型，缺乏统一性。本文旨在通过统一方法和新数据集解决这一问题。

Method: 使用大规模数据集（1300小时音频-乐谱图像对）和统一的标记化框架，将不同模态离散化为令牌序列，采用单一编码器-解码器Transformer模型处理多任务。

Conclusion: 统一方法在多模态音乐翻译中具有显著优势，为跨模态音乐生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores,
MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core
tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription
(audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score).
However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on
individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach,
where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks
simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new
large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose
a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score
image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger
than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified
tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into
a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle
multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.
Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon
single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error
rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,
while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other
translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful
score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in
cross-modal music generation.

Motivation: 海洋环境中日益严重的噪声污染威胁海洋健康，需监测水下噪声以识别污染源。现有监督学习方法依赖高质量标记数据，但这类数据稀缺，而大量低质量未标记数据可用。

Method: 采用无监督对比学习方法，使用Conformer编码器和Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization损失函数优化，利用未标记数据生成鲁棒嵌入，再迁移到标记数据。

Result: 通过船舶类型和海洋哺乳动物发声分类任务验证，方法能生成鲁棒且通用的嵌入。

Conclusion: 研究表明无监督方法在水下声学分析任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: The increasing level of sound pollution in marine environments poses an
increased threat to ocean health, making it crucial to monitor underwater
noise. By monitoring this noise, the sources responsible for this pollution can
be mapped. Monitoring is performed by passively listening to these sounds. This
generates a large amount of data records, capturing a mix of sound sources such
as ship activities and marine mammal vocalizations. Although machine learning
offers a promising solution for automatic sound classification, current
state-of-the-art methods implement supervised learning. This requires a large
amount of high-quality labeled data that is not publicly available. In
contrast, a massive amount of lower-quality unlabeled data is publicly
available, offering the opportunity to explore unsupervised learning
techniques. This research explores this possibility by implementing an
unsupervised Contrastive Learning approach. Here, a Conformer-based encoder is
optimized by the so-called Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization loss
function on these lower-quality unlabeled data and the translation to the
labeled data is made. Through classification tasks involving recognizing ship
types and marine mammal vocalizations, our method demonstrates to produce
robust and generalized embeddings. This shows to potential of unsupervised
methods for various automatic underwater acoustic analysis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有声书系统存在需要手动配置、单调语调或依赖昂贵训练的问题，MultiActor-Audiobook旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 引入MSP（多模态说话人角色生成）和LSI（基于LLM的脚本指令生成）两种新方法，无需额外训练即可生成情感丰富的语音。

Result: 通过与商业产品对比，系统在人类和MLLM评估中表现优异，并通过消融实验验证了MSP和LSI的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiActor-Audiobook提供了一种高效、低成本且情感丰富的有声书生成方案。

Abstract: We introduce MultiActor-Audiobook, a zero-shot approach for generating
audiobooks that automatically produces consistent, expressive, and
speaker-appropriate prosody, including intonation and emotion. Previous
audiobook systems have several limitations: they require users to manually
configure the speaker's prosody, read each sentence with a monotonic tone
compared to voice actors, or rely on costly training. However, our
MultiActor-Audiobook addresses these issues by introducing two novel processes:
(1) MSP (**Multimodal Speaker Persona Generation**) and (2) LSI (**LLM-based
Script Instruction Generation**). With these two processes,
MultiActor-Audiobook can generate more emotionally expressive audiobooks with a
consistent speaker prosody without additional training. We compare our system
with commercial products, through human and MLLM evaluations, achieving
competitive results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP and
LSI through ablation studies.

Motivation: 现有因果语音分离模型因难以保留历史信息而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 结合LSTM层、缓存记忆模块和因果注意力细化模块，捕捉时空关系。

Result: TFACM性能接近TF-GridNet-Causal，但复杂度更低、参数更少。

Conclusion: TFACM为因果语音分离提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to
non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To
address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM)
model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an
attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage.
In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal
modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global
representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal
attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature
representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM
achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with
significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters. For more

Motivation: 现有ECG-文本对比学习方法因报告不完整而难以捕捉波形特征和诊断推理，FG-CLEP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型恢复缺失的波形特征，引入语义相似性矩阵和sigmoid损失函数处理多标签任务。

Result: 在六个数据集上，FG-CLEP在零样本预测和线性探测中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FG-CLEP通过恢复波形特征和改进对比学习，显著提升了ECG诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases. While previous ECG-text contrastive learning methods have shown
promising results, they often overlook the incompleteness of the reports. Given
an ECG, the report is generated by first identifying key waveform features and
then inferring the final diagnosis through these features. Despite their
importance, these waveform features are often not recorded in the report as
intermediate results. Aligning ECGs with such incomplete reports impedes the
model's ability to capture the ECG's waveform features and limits its
understanding of diagnostic reasoning based on those features. To address this,
we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which
aims to recover these waveform features from incomplete reports with the help
of large language models (LLMs), under the challenges of hallucinations and the
non-bijective relationship between waveform features and diagnoses.
Additionally, considering the frequent false negatives due to the prevalence of
common diagnoses in ECGs, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide
contrastive learning. Furthermore, we adopt a sigmoid-based loss function to
accommodate the multi-label nature of ECG-related tasks. Experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
zero-shot prediction and linear probing across these datasets.

Conclusion: S-Crescendo为高维非线性建模提供了可扩展的物理感知框架。

Abstract: Simulation of high-order nonlinear system requires extensive computational
resources, especially in modern VLSI backend design where bifurcation-induced
instability and chaos-like transient behaviors pose challenges. We present
S-Crescendo - a nested transformer weaving framework that synergizes S-domain
with neural operators for scalable time-domain prediction in high-order
nonlinear networks, alleviating the computational bottlenecks of conventional
solvers via Newton-Raphson method. By leveraging the partial-fraction
decomposition of an n-th order transfer function into first-order modal terms
with repeated poles and residues, our method bypasses the conventional Jacobian
matrix-based iterations and efficiently reduces computational complexity from
cubic $O(n^3)$ to linear $O(n)$.The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates
an S-domain encoder with an attention-based correction operator to
simultaneously isolate dominant response and adaptively capture higher-order
non-linearities. Validated on order-1 to order-10 networks, our method achieves
up to 0.99 test-set ($R^2$) accuracy against HSPICE golden waveforms and
accelerates simulation by up to 18(X), providing a scalable, physics-aware
framework for high-dimensional nonlinear modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based
high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information
(CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind
of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional
generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network
architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to
fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the
second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide
the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture
the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive
to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature
of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme,
which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels.
Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to
generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing
framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance
improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.

Conclusion: 研究为EEG深度学习领域提供了数据分区和交叉验证的分析，并提出了避免数据泄漏的指南，以解决当前领域中的性能高估问题。

Abstract: Deep learning is significantly advancing the analysis of
electroencephalography (EEG) data by effectively discovering highly nonlinear
patterns within the signals. Data partitioning and cross-validation are crucial
for assessing model performance and ensuring study comparability, as they can
produce varied results and data leakage due to specific signal properties
(e.g., biometric). Such variability leads to incomparable studies and,
increasingly, overestimated performance claims, which are detrimental to the
field. Nevertheless, no comprehensive guidelines for proper data partitioning
and cross-validation exist in the domain, nor is there a quantitative
evaluation of their impact on model accuracy, reliability, and
generalizability. To assist researchers in identifying optimal experimental
strategies, this paper thoroughly investigates the role of data partitioning
and cross-validation in evaluating EEG deep learning models. Five
cross-validation settings are compared across three supervised cross-subject
classification tasks (BCI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease detection) and
four established architectures of increasing complexity (ShallowConvNet,
EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and Temporal-based ResNet). The comparison of over 100,000
trained models underscores, first, the importance of using subject-based
cross-validation strategies for evaluating EEG deep learning models, except
when within-subject analyses are acceptable (e.g., BCI). Second, it highlights
the greater reliability of nested approaches (N-LNSO) compared to non-nested
counterparts, which are prone to data leakage and favor larger models
overfitting to validation data. In conclusion, this work provides EEG deep
learning researchers with an analysis of data partitioning and cross-validation
and offers guidelines to avoid data leakage, currently undermining the domain
with potentially overestimated performance claims.

Abstract: We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an
unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of
compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that
focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal
basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse
gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned
representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal
reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which
increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal
patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 %
compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a
challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining
effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual
radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be
fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the
cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than
existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.

Abstract: The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces
describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an
essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of
thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition
state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations,
the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a
primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian
process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method
where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A
surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic
structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular
reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput.
18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic
structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is
obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range
in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried
out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of
electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method
implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the
GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle
point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations
are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.

Abstract: Accelerating the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)
while maintaining accuracy at coarse spatiotemporal resolution remains a key
challenge in scientific computing. Physics-informed machine learning (ML)
methods such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) introduce prior
knowledge through loss functions to ensure physical consistency, but their
"soft constraints" are usually not strictly satisfied. Here, we propose LaPON,
an operator network inspired by the Lagrange's mean value theorem, which embeds
prior knowledge directly into the neural network architecture instead of the
loss function, making the neural network naturally satisfy the given
constraints. This is a hybrid framework that combines neural operators with
traditional numerical methods, where neural operators are used to compensate
for the effect of discretization errors on the analytical scale in
under-resolution simulations. As evaluated on turbulence problem modeled by the
Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), the multiple time step extrapolation accuracy
and stability of LaPON exceed the direct numerical simulation baseline at 8x
coarser grids and 8x larger time steps, while achieving a vorticity correlation
of more than 0.98 with the ground truth. It is worth noting that the model can
be well generalized to unseen flow states, such as turbulence with different
forcing, without retraining. In addition, with the same training data, LaPON's
comprehensive metrics on the out-of-distribution test set are at least
approximately twice as good as two popular ML baseline methods. By combining
numerical computing with machine learning, LaPON provides a scalable and
reliable solution for high-fidelity fluid dynamics simulation, showing the
potential for wide application in fields such as weather forecasting and
engineering design.

### [723] [On Technique Identification and Threat-Actor Attribution using LLMs and Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11547)
*Kyla Guru,Robert J. Moss,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在基于行为指标的网络攻击归因中的应用，发现LLMs生成的TTPs与人工生成的数据集相似度低但频率相似，仍可用于训练高于基线的归因模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络攻击归因复杂且关键，目前从密集的取证文档中手动提取行为指标导致显著延迟，尤其是在国际规模的事件后。

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4和text-embedding-3-large模型，通过向量嵌入搜索从文本中识别TTPs，并构建配置文件用于归因。

Result: LLMs生成的TTPs数据集存在噪声，与人工生成的数据集相似度低，但频率相似，且可用于训练高于基线的归因模型。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs生成的TTPs与人工数据集不同，但仍对归因模型训练有效，研究提供了从原始CTI文档到威胁行为者预测的端到端流程。

Abstract: Attribution of cyber-attacks remains a complex but critical challenge for
cyber defenders. Currently, manual extraction of behavioral indicators from
dense forensic documentation causes significant attribution delays, especially
following major incidents at the international scale. This research evaluates
large language models (LLMs) for cyber-attack attribution based on behavioral
indicators extracted from forensic documentation. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and
text-embedding-3-large for identifying threat actors' tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) by comparing LLM-generated TTPs against human-generated data
from MITRE ATT&CK Groups. Our framework then identifies TTPs from text using
vector embedding search and builds profiles to attribute new attacks for a
machine learning model to learn. Key contributions include: (1) assessing
off-the-shelf LLMs for TTP extraction and attribution, and (2) developing an
end-to-end pipeline from raw CTI documents to threat-actor prediction. This
research finds that standard LLMs generate TTP datasets with noise, resulting
in a low similarity to human-generated datasets. However, the TTPs generated
are similar in frequency to those within the existing MITRE datasets.
Additionally, although these TTPs are different than human-generated datasets,
our work demonstrates that they still prove useful for training a model that
performs above baseline on attribution. Project code and files are contained

TL;DR: AuthChain是一种新型的知识投毒攻击方法，通过利用证据链理论和权威效应，提高单文档投毒攻击的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管检索增强生成（RAG）系统提高了大型语言模型（LLM）的准确性，但其依赖外部知识库引入了安全漏洞，尤其是当知识库可公开修改时。现有攻击方法（如饱和攻击）易被检测且不实用。

Method: AuthChain结合证据链理论和权威效应，生成更具说服力的投毒文档，以克服真实文档和LLM内部知识的干扰。

Result: 在六种流行LLM上的实验表明，AuthChain的攻击成功率显著高于现有方法，同时保持较高的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: AuthChain为单文档投毒攻击提供了一种高效且隐蔽的解决方案，揭示了RAG系统的潜在安全风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses.
However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential
security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly
accessible and modifiable. Poisoning attacks on knowledge bases for RAG systems
face two fundamental challenges: the injected malicious content must compete
with multiple authentic documents retrieved by the retriever, and LLMs tend to
trust retrieved information that aligns with their internal memorized
knowledge. Previous works attempt to address these challenges by injecting
multiple malicious documents, but such saturation attacks are easily detectable
and impractical in real-world scenarios. To enable the effective single
document poisoning attack, we propose AuthChain, a novel knowledge poisoning
attack method that leverages Chain-of-Evidence theory and authority effect to
craft more convincing poisoned documents. AuthChain generates poisoned content
that establishes strong evidence chains and incorporates authoritative
statements, effectively overcoming the interference from both authentic
documents and LLMs' internal knowledge. Extensive experiments across six
popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack
success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense
mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AC-LoRA是一个端到端系统，用于企业LLM聊天机器人，通过分离的LoRA适配器和文档嵌入实现严格的信息隔离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM容易泄露敏感信息，难以在需要严格访问控制的环境中应用。

Method: 设计AC-LoRA系统，使用独立的LoRA适配器和文档嵌入，基于用户查询和权限检索适配器，合并响应。

Result: AC-LoRA在性能上匹配或超过现有LoRA混合技术，同时提供强隔离保证，并可应用于不同模态。

Conclusion: AC-LoRA是一种高效且安全的解决方案，适用于企业环境中需要严格信息隔离的场景。

Abstract: Corporate LLMs are gaining traction for efficient knowledge dissemination and
management within organizations. However, as current LLMs are vulnerable to
leaking sensitive information, it has proven difficult to apply them in
settings where strict access control is necessary. To this end, we design
AC-LoRA, an end-to-end system for access control-aware corporate LLM chatbots
that maintains a strong information isolation guarantee. AC-LoRA maintains
separate LoRA adapters for permissioned datasets, along with the document
embedding they are finetuned on. AC-LoRA retrieves a precise set of LoRA
adapters based on the similarity score with the user query and their
permission. This similarity score is later used to merge the responses if more
than one LoRA is retrieved, without requiring any additional training for LoRA
routing. We provide an end-to-end prototype of AC-LoRA, evaluate it on two
datasets, and show that AC-LoRA matches or even exceeds the performance of
state-of-the-art LoRA mixing techniques while providing strong isolation
guarantees. Furthermore, we show that AC-LoRA design can be directly applied to
different modalities.

Conclusion: 论文开源了数据集、评估指标和方法，以促进自动化网络安全威胁分析的研究和可重复性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have shown promise in cybersecurity applications,
their effectiveness in identifying security threats within cloud deployments
remains unexplored. This paper introduces AWS Cloud Security Engineering Eval,
a novel dataset for evaluating LLMs cloud security threat modeling
capabilities. ACSE-Eval contains 100 production grade AWS deployment scenarios,
each featuring detailed architectural specifications, Infrastructure as Code
implementations, documented security vulnerabilities, and associated threat
modeling parameters. Our dataset enables systemic assessment of LLMs abilities
to identify security risks, analyze attack vectors, and propose mitigation
strategies in cloud environments. Our evaluations on ACSE-Eval demonstrate that
GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at threat identification, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing optimally in 0-shot scenarios and GPT 4.1 showing superior results
in few-shot settings. While GPT 4.1 maintains a slight overall performance
advantage, Claude 3.7 Sonnet generates the most semantically sophisticated
threat models but struggles with threat categorization and generalization. To
promote reproducibility and advance research in automated cybersecurity threat
analysis, we open-source our dataset, evaluation metrics, and methodologies.

TL;DR: 该论文首次量化了预训练语言模型（PTLMs）中后门攻击的复杂性，并提出了一种基于多任务学习的方法来减少这种复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PTLMs中后门攻击的潜在风险，尤其是当这些模型被适配到与预定义任务无关的下游任务时，可能导致输出异常并降低攻击的隐蔽性。

Method: 通过4种主流PTLMs和16个文本分类基准数据集进行实验，量化后门复杂性，并提出一种基于多任务学习的缓解方法。

Result: 实验表明，后门复杂性在下游模型中普遍存在，且触发样本的输出分布与干净样本显著不同。提出的方法能有效减少复杂性，同时保持后门攻击的效果和一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了后门复杂性的普遍性，并提出了一种无需下游任务先验知识的缓解方法，为提升PTLMs的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research highlights concerns about the trustworthiness of third-party
Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) due to potential backdoor attacks. These
backdoored PTLMs, however, are effective only for specific pre-defined
downstream tasks. In reality, these PTLMs can be adapted to many other
unrelated downstream tasks. Such adaptation may lead to unforeseen consequences
in downstream model outputs, consequently raising user suspicion and
compromising attack stealthiness. We refer to this phenomenon as backdoor
complications. In this paper, we undertake the first comprehensive
quantification of backdoor complications. Through extensive experiments using 4
prominent PTLMs and 16 text classification benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
the widespread presence of backdoor complications in downstream models
fine-tuned from backdoored PTLMs. The output distribution of triggered samples
significantly deviates from that of clean samples. Consequently, we propose a
backdoor complication reduction method leveraging multi-task learning to
mitigate complications without prior knowledge of downstream tasks. The
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
reduce complications while maintaining the efficacy and consistency of backdoor
attacks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: MARVEL是一种多代理LLM框架，用于硬件安全验证，通过模拟设计师的认知过程，结合多种工具和方法，显著提高了漏洞检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件安全验证是一项复杂且耗时的任务，现有工具和方法需要改进以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 提出MARVEL框架，包含一个监督代理和多个执行代理，监督代理制定安全策略，执行代理使用不同工具（如形式验证、静态分析等）检测漏洞。

Result: 在OpenTitan的已知漏洞SoC上测试，MARVEL报告的48个问题中有20个是真实的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: MARVEL通过多代理协作和多样化工具的结合，显著提升了硬件安全验证的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Hardware security verification is a challenging and time-consuming task. For
this purpose, design engineers may utilize tools such as formal verification,
linters, and functional simulation tests, coupled with analysis and a deep
understanding of the hardware design being inspected. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been used to assist during this task, either directly or in
conjunction with existing tools. We improve the state of the art by proposing
MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making,
tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer
looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor
agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its
security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to
individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task
using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to
identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the
supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes
executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests,
LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our
approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE
competition. We find that 20 of the 48 issues reported by MARVEL pose security
vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: MASLEAK是一种新型攻击框架，用于从多智能体系统（MAS）中提取敏感信息，攻击成功率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）和多智能体系统（MAS）的快速发展，知识产权（IP）保护问题日益突出。

Method: MASLEAK采用黑盒攻击方式，通过精心设计的查询从MAS中提取信息，无需了解系统架构或配置。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实MAS应用中，MASLEAK对系统提示、任务指令和系统架构的提取成功率分别达到87%和92%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MAS的IP泄露风险，并探讨了潜在的防御措施。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the
emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through
collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their
architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding
intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a
novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS
applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the
adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent
configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public
API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent.
Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts,
MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain
responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components,
including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task
instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS
applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world
MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in
extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system
prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases.
We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential
defenses.

*Sayon Palit,Daniel Woods*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究分析了13种LLM安全工具，评估了7种，发现基线模型（ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo）误报率高，Lakera Guard和ProtectAI LLM Guard表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在关键系统中的集成带来安全风险，缺乏对安全工具效果和可用性的正式评估。

Method: 构建恶意提示基准数据集，评估7种工具的性能，并与基线模型对比。

Result: 基线模型误报率高，Lakera Guard和ProtectAI LLM Guard在性能和可用性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 建议提高闭源工具的透明度，改进上下文感知检测，增强开源参与，提升用户意识，采用更具代表性的性能指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical
systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit
queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with
information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This
gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and
the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as
leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party.
While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is
little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study
addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM
security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source),
but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model
owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and
evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model
(ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many
false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard
emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and
performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency
among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced
open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more
representative performance metrics.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoLO是一个统一框架，通过链式水印同时实现训练验证（PoL）和所有权证明（PoO），提高效率并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型被共享和外包，需要同时验证训练努力（PoL）和所有权（PoO）以防止伪造和隐私泄露，但现有方法通常分开处理，导致保护不足和验证成本高。

Method: PoLO将训练过程细分为多个训练片段，每个片段嵌入一个专用水印，水印基于前一片段的哈希生成，形成链式结构。完整水印集作为PoL，最终水印作为PoO。

Result: PoLO在所有权验证中达到99%的水印检测准确率，验证成本仅为传统方法的1.5-10%，且伪造成本比诚实证明生成高1.1-4倍。

Conclusion: PoLO通过链式水印高效且隐私保护地统一了PoL和PoO，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly shared and outsourced, raising
requirements of verifying training effort (Proof-of-Learning, PoL) to ensure
claimed performance and establishing ownership (Proof-of-Ownership, PoO) for
transactions. When models are trained by untrusted parties, PoL and PoO must be
enforced together to enable protection, attribution, and compensation. However,
existing studies typically address them separately, which not only weakens
protection against forgery and privacy breaches but also leads to high
verification overhead.
  We propose PoLO, a unified framework that simultaneously achieves PoL and PoO
using chained watermarks. PoLO splits the training process into fine-grained
training shards and embeds a dedicated watermark in each shard. Each watermark
is generated using the hash of the preceding shard, certifying the training
process of the preceding shard. The chained structure makes it computationally
difficult to forge any individual part of the whole training process. The
complete set of watermarks serves as the PoL, while the final watermark
provides the PoO. PoLO offers more efficient and privacy-preserving
verification compared to the vanilla PoL solutions that rely on gradient-based
trajectory tracing and inadvertently expose training data during verification,
while maintaining the same level of ownership assurance of watermark-based PoO
schemes. Our evaluation shows that PoLO achieves 99% watermark detection
accuracy for ownership verification, while preserving data privacy and cutting
verification costs to just 1.5-10% of traditional methods. Forging PoLO demands
1.1-4x more resources than honest proof generation, with the original proof
retaining over 90% detection accuracy even after attacks.

Result: 实验表明，该框架能有效检测真实和合成异常，并提供可解释的结果，帮助重建异常来源。

Conclusion: 该框架可无缝集成到企业环境中，补充现有安全系统，实现可解释的威胁检测。

Abstract: User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data
analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to
detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep
Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA
tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to
the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive
business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of
an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep
Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual
features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural
networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely
used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results
demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic
anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models
provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable
results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly.
Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly
integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security
systems for explainable threat detection.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enhance mobility but face
cybersecurity threats, particularly through the insecure Controller Area
Network (CAN) bus. Cyberattacks can have devastating consequences in connected
vehicles, including the loss of control over critical systems, necessitating
robust security solutions. In-vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) offer
a promising approach by detecting malicious activities in real time. This
survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research on
learning-based in-vehicle IDSs, focusing on Machine Learning (ML), Deep
Learning (DL), and Federated Learning (FL) approaches. Based on the reviewed
studies, we critically examine existing IDS approaches, categorising them by
the types of attacks they detect - known, unknown, and combined known-unknown
attacks - while identifying their limitations. We also review the evaluation
metrics used in research, emphasising the need to consider multiple criteria to
meet the requirements of safety-critical systems. Additionally, we analyse
FL-based IDSs and highlight their limitations. By doing so, this survey helps
identify effective security measures, address existing limitations, and guide
future research toward more resilient and adaptive protection mechanisms,
ensuring the safety and reliability of CAVs.

Result: 在复杂环境中验证了框架的有效性，提供了可扩展的行为解释，支持从红队模拟到策略调试的多种用例。

Conclusion: 该框架将黑盒学习转化为可操作的行为智能，帮助防御者和开发者更好地预测、分析和应对自主网络威胁。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly used to simulate
sophisticated cyberattacks, but their decision-making processes remain opaque,
hindering trust, debugging, and defensive preparedness. In high-stakes
cybersecurity contexts, explainability is essential for understanding how
adversarial strategies are formed and evolve over time. In this paper, we
propose a unified, multi-layer explainability framework for RL-based attacker
agents that reveals both strategic (MDP-level) and tactical (policy-level)
reasoning. At the MDP level, we model cyberattacks as a Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to expose exploration-exploitation dynamics
and phase-aware behavioural shifts. At the policy level, we analyse the
temporal evolution of Q-values and use Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) to
surface critical learning transitions and evolving action preferences.
Evaluated across CyberBattleSim environments of increasing complexity, our
framework offers interpretable insights into agent behaviour at scale. Unlike
previous explainable RL methods, which are often post-hoc, domain-specific, or
limited in depth, our approach is both agent- and environment-agnostic,
supporting use cases ranging from red-team simulation to RL policy debugging.
By transforming black-box learning into actionable behavioural intelligence,
our framework enables both defenders and developers to better anticipate,
analyse, and respond to autonomous cyber threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have been widely deployed
in a wide range of applications in the real world, including healthcare
diagnostics, financial analysis, customer support, robotics, and autonomous
driving, expanding their powerful capability of understanding, reasoning, and
generating natural languages. However, the wide deployment of LLM-based
applications exposes critical security and reliability risks, such as the
potential for malicious misuse, privacy leakage, and service disruption that
weaken user trust and undermine societal safety. This paper provides a
systematic overview of the details of adversarial attacks targeting both LLMs
and LLM-based agents. These attacks are organized into three phases in LLMs:
Training-Phase Attacks, Inference-Phase Attacks, and Availability & Integrity
Attacks. For each phase, we analyze the details of representative and recently
introduced attack methods along with their corresponding defenses. We hope our
survey will provide a good tutorial and a comprehensive understanding of LLM
security, especially for attacks on LLMs. We desire to raise attention to the
risks inherent in widely deployed LLM-based applications and highlight the
urgent need for robust mitigation strategies for evolving threats.

Method: 通过LLMs的语义理解能力，设计了一种防御框架，解决了黑盒优化问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护了网络内容创作者的IP，为应对LLMs带来的挑战提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Protecting cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an
increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with
online retrieval capabilities presents a double-edged sword that enables
convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original
content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they
gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources,
significantly reducing the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and
leading to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response,
we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to
safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction by
leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method
follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable
black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our
methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs,
outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FL-PLAS是一种新型联邦学习防御算法，通过部分层聚合策略有效抵御后门攻击，无需服务器辅助数据集，在高比例恶意用户下仍保持高主任务准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受后门攻击，现有防御方法难以应对高比例恶意用户或依赖辅助数据集，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将本地模型分为特征提取器和分类器，仅上传特征提取器参数进行聚合，保留分类器层以隔离后门标签影响。

Result: 在三种图像数据集上测试，FL-PLAS能有效抵御后门攻击，主任务准确率高，后门准确率低，即使90%恶意用户也能应对。

Conclusion: FL-PLAS是一种高效且无需辅助数据的防御方法，适用于高恶意用户比例场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is gaining increasing attention as an emerging
collaborative machine learning approach, particularly in the context of
large-scale computing and data systems. However, the fundamental algorithm of
FL, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Although
researchers have proposed numerous defense algorithms, two significant
challenges remain. The attack is becoming more stealthy and harder to detect,
and current defense methods are unable to handle 50\% or more malicious users
or assume an auxiliary server dataset.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense algorithm, FL-PLAS,
\textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning based on \textbf{P}artial\textbf{ L}ayer
\textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{S}trategy. In particular, we divide the local
model into a feature extractor and a classifier. In each iteration, the clients
only upload the parameters of a feature extractor after local training. The
server then aggregates these local parameters and returns the results to the
clients.
  Each client retains its own classifier layer, ensuring that the backdoor
labels do not impact other clients. We assess the effectiveness of FL-PLAS
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on three image datasets and
compare our approach to six defense strategies. The results of the experiment
demonstrate that our methods can effectively protect local models from backdoor
attacks. Without requiring any auxiliary dataset for the server, our method
achieves a high main-task accuracy with a lower backdoor accuracy even under
the condition of 90\% malicious users with the attacks of trigger, semantic and
edge-case.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的显式矩阵分解方法BISR，用于差分隐私训练中的多轮参与问题，填补了理论误差界限的空白，并证明其渐近最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮矩阵分解方法在理论和实际误差之间存在显著差距，需要一种更优的分解方法。

Method: 引入Banded Inverse Square Root (BISR)方法，通过对逆相关矩阵施加带状结构，实现多轮误差的显式紧致刻画。

Result: BISR在理论和实验上均表现优异，实现了渐近最优误差，且计算高效、易于实现和分析。

Conclusion: BISR是一种简单高效且理论优越的矩阵分解方法，适用于差分隐私训练中的多轮参与场景。

Abstract: Matrix factorization mechanisms for differentially private training have
emerged as a promising approach to improve model utility under privacy
constraints. In practical settings, models are typically trained over multiple
epochs, requiring matrix factorizations that account for repeated
participation. Existing theoretical upper and lower bounds on multi-epoch
factorization error leave a significant gap. In this work, we introduce a new
explicit factorization method, Banded Inverse Square Root (BISR), which imposes
a banded structure on the inverse correlation matrix. This factorization
enables us to derive an explicit and tight characterization of the multi-epoch
error. We further prove that BISR achieves asymptotically optimal error by
matching the upper and lower bounds. Empirically, BISR performs on par with
state-of-the-art factorization methods, while being simpler to implement,
computationally efficient, and easier to analyze.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件分类对网络安全至关重要，但高维权限数据和训练样本不足增加了分类难度，尤其是新恶意软件家族的不断出现。

Result: 实验证明该系统高效实用，已在商业环境中部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为恶意软件分类提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Malware are malicious programs that are grouped into families based on their
penetration technique, source code, and other characteristics. Classifying
malware programs into their respective families is essential for building
effective defenses against cyber threats. Machine learning models have a huge
potential in malware detection on mobile devices, as malware families can be
recognized by classifying permission data extracted from Android manifest
files. Still, the malware classification task is challenging due to the
high-dimensional nature of permission data and the limited availability of
training samples. In particular, the steady emergence of new malware families
makes it impossible to acquire a comprehensive training set covering all the
malware classes. In this work, we present a malware classification system that,
on top of classifying known malware, detects new ones. In particular, we
combine an open-set recognition technique developed within the computer vision
community, namely MaxLogit, with a tree-based Gradient Boosting classifier,
which is particularly effective in classifying high-dimensional data. Our
solution turns out to be very practical, as it can be seamlessly employed in a
standard classification workflow, and efficient, as it adds minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets
demonstrate the potential of our solution, which has been deployed in a
business environment.

TL;DR: FLTG是一种新的联邦学习聚合算法，通过角度防御和动态参考选择，解决了高恶意客户比例和非独立同分布数据下的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高恶意客户比例和非独立同分布数据下鲁棒性不足，导致准确性下降。

Method: FLTG通过ReLU截断余弦相似度过滤客户，动态选择参考客户以减少非独立同分布偏差，并基于角度偏差分配聚合权重。

Result: 在多种数据集和攻击下，FLTG在高恶意客户比例（超过50%）下仍保持鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FLTG在极端偏差和高恶意客户比例下表现出色，为联邦学习提供了更可靠的聚合方法。

Abstract: Byzantine attacks during model aggregation in Federated Learning (FL)
threaten training integrity by manipulating malicious clients' updates.
Existing methods struggle with limited robustness under high malicious client
ratios and sensitivity to non-i.i.d. data, leading to degraded accuracy. To
address this, we propose FLTG, a novel aggregation algorithm integrating
angle-based defense and dynamic reference selection. FLTG first filters clients
via ReLU-clipped cosine similarity, leveraging a server-side clean dataset to
exclude misaligned updates. It then dynamically selects a reference client
based on the prior global model to mitigate non-i.i.d. bias, assigns
aggregation weights inversely proportional to angular deviations, and
normalizes update magnitudes to suppress malicious scaling. Evaluations across
datasets of varying complexity under five classic attacks demonstrate FLTG's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods under extreme bias scenarios and
sustains robustness with a higher proportion(over 50%) of malicious clients.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于全同态加密的特征选择外包算法，解决了多参与方环境下隐私保护的问题，显著提升了时间和空间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模数据中，特征选择能提升模型性能，但在数据所有者与分析者分离或多所有者场景下，隐私保护成为关键。现有方法需多方参与且无法完全信任外部环境。

Method: 提出首个基于全同态加密的特征选择外包算法，优化了时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 算法将复杂度从O(kn^2)提升至O(kn log^3 n)和O(kn)，实验证明其在小数据集上也高效。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私保护特征选择提供了高效解决方案，适用于多方不可信环境。

Abstract: Feature selection is a technique that extracts a meaningful subset from a set
of features in training data. When the training data is large-scale,
appropriate feature selection enables the removal of redundant features, which
can improve generalization performance, accelerate the training process, and
enhance the interpretability of the model. This study proposes a
privacy-preserving computation model for feature selection. Generally, when the
data owner and analyst are the same, there is no need to conceal the private
information. However, when they are different parties or when multiple owners
exist, an appropriate privacy-preserving framework is required. Although
various private feature selection algorithms, they all require two or more
computing parties and do not guarantee security in environments where no
external party can be fully trusted. To address this issue, we propose the
first outsourcing algorithm for feature selection using fully homomorphic
encryption. Compared to a prior two-party algorithm, our result improves the
time and space complexity O(kn^2) to O(kn log^3 n) and O(kn), where k and n
denote the number of features and data samples, respectively. We also
implemented the proposed algorithm and conducted comparative experiments with
the naive one. The experimental result shows the efficiency of our method even
with small datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）在移动计算中的广泛应用，移动AI代理的安全问题尚未被充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析移动代理的工作流程，识别了语言推理、GUI交互和系统执行三个核心能力维度的安全威胁，并开发了AgentScan框架进行半自动化安全评估。

Result: 研究发现所有测试的代理均存在漏洞，最严重的案例中涉及8种攻击向量，可能导致行为偏差、隐私泄露或执行劫持。

Conclusion: 本文强调了在快速发展的LLM驱动移动自动化领域中标准化安全实践的紧迫性，并提出了防御建议，得到了主要设备厂商的积极反馈。

Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new
paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of
decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the
security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper,
we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents,
encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed
by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party
Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g.,
Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile
agents and identifying security threats across three core capability
dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level
execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the
unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning
their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice,
we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that
systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios.
Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning
trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases,
agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These
attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full
execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive
design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM
agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device
vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized
security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile
automation.

Conclusion: 本文为浏览代理的安全部署提供了端到端的威胁模型和实用的防御措施，强调了深度防御策略的重要性。

Abstract: Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on
dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad
attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such
agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural
layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents
and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world
environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth
strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal
analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial
access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a
popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web
content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our
findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential
exfiltration, evidenced by a disclosed CVE and a working proof of concept
exploit.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在准确性、收敛速度和数据隐私保护上显著优于传统联邦学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨云协作中的数据隐私问题，同时提升了AI系统的性能和安全性。

Abstract: In the age of cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a major
challenge, especially when sharing sensitive data across cloud environments.
However, how to optimize collaboration across cloud environments remains an
unresolved problem. In this paper, we combine federated learning with
large-scale language models to optimize the collaborative mechanism of AI
systems. Based on the existing federated learning framework, we introduce a
cross-cloud architecture in which federated learning works by aggregating model
updates from decentralized nodes without exposing the original data. At the
same time, combined with large-scale language models, its powerful context and
semantic understanding capabilities are used to improve model training
efficiency and decision-making ability. We've further innovated by introducing
a secure communication layer to ensure the privacy and integrity of model
updates and training data. The model enables continuous model adaptation and
fine-tuning across different cloud environments while protecting sensitive
data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly
better than the traditional federated learning model in terms of accuracy,
convergence speed and data privacy protection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以应对现代软件系统的规模和复杂性，特别是在设计模式检测和代码重构方面。

Method: ASE通过BSS提供语言无关的代码表示，ODR通过启发式算法优化代码重构。

Result: ASE成功平衡了抽象、工具可访问性、兼容性和可扩展性，为复杂软件工程问题提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ASE为未来研究复杂软件度量的编码和分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges
associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate.
Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these
complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for
maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and
long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a
paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper
presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed
at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability.
ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering
problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks
Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR),
both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact,
language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design
pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to
optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative
computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design
challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and
analyzing complex software metrics.

*Sen Fang,Weiyuan Ding,Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EVALOOP是一个新的评估框架，通过自一致性循环评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在编程任务中的鲁棒性，无需依赖外部攻击设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注静态基准测试的准确性，忽略了模型在编程任务中的鲁棒性，而现有的对抗攻击方法效果有限且结果不一致。

Method: EVALOOP通过自反馈循环（如代码生成与代码摘要的循环）评估模型的鲁棒性，无需外部攻击。

Result: 在16个主流LLMs上测试，EVALOOP通常在10次循环内导致pass@1性能下降5.01%-19.31%。

Conclusion: EVALOOP提供了一种统一的鲁棒性评估方法，发现初始性能与鲁棒性并不总是一致。

Abstract: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations,
however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static
benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during
programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model
robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained.
Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent
results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We
introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness
from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality
inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code
summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM
generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language
specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new
output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats
the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical
strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack
setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming.
We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found
that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1
performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align
with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo,
despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated
lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is emerging as a key direction in the integration
of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. However, there remains a
lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address
this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated
evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth
Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the
GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench)
comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework
integrates both question generation and answer verification components to
enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to
execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative
analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution
efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including
general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized
models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization
pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and

Result: 在多个开源Java项目中，EvoGPT平均提升了10%的代码覆盖率和变异分数。

Conclusion: 结合LLM驱动的多样性、针对性修复和进化优化，能生成更有效和稳健的测试套件。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for
automated unit test generation. We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT
that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques
to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially
generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test
suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided
assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic
algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over
traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of
unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects,
EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and
mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity,
targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and
resilient test suites.

Motivation: 程序员常因警告信息冗长、复杂且可能存在误报而忽视静态分析工具的警告，但某些警告可能隐藏严重漏洞。

Method: 提出使用大型语言模型简化警告信息，解释其重要性并提供修复建议。

Result: 通过简化警告和提供明确指导，可提高开发者修复警告的合规性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能有效改善开发者对静态分析警告的响应，减少潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Programmers have long ignored warnings, especially those generated by static
analysis tools, due to the potential for false-positives. In some cases,
warnings may be indicative of larger issues, but programmers may not understand
how a seemingly unimportant warning can grow into a vulnerability. Because
these messages tend to be long and confusing, programmers tend to ignore them
if they do not cause readily identifiable issues. Large language models can
simplify these warnings, explain the gravity of important warnings, and suggest
potential fixes to increase developer compliance with fixing warnings.

Conclusion: OSS-Bench提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，用于评估LLM在真实世界中的编码能力，并减轻了过拟合问题。

Abstract: In light of the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants, LLM-assisted
development has become increasingly prevalent, creating an urgent need for
robust evaluation of generated code quality. Existing benchmarks often require
extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or
insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or
neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety
issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that
automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world
open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and
evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional
correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation
failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our
evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql),
profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral
patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results
demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving
complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code
security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a
practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding
capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 竞争编程中存在大量重复或相似问题，影响公平性和模型评估的有效性，需要新方法解决。

Method: 提出CPRet基准套件，包含四种检索任务（代码和问题中心），并开发两种专用检索模型（CPRetriever-Code和CPRetriever-Prob）。

Result: CPRetriever-Code和CPRetriever-Prob表现优异，开源供本地使用；高相似问题会夸大模型通过率。

Conclusion: 未来基准需考虑相似性问题，CPRet为竞争编程检索任务提供了高质量数据和模型。

Abstract: Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as
programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing
presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about
competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as
a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem --
similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both
data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce
CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming,
covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and
Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e.,
Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of
automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations.
Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally
separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two
task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained
with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and
CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both
models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we
analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass
rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware
evaluation in future benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前代码补全评估指标与用户实际感知存在差距，且大型语言模型在仓库级代码补全场景中缺乏有效的结构语义建模和跨模块依赖信息。

Method: 提出LCP和ROUGE-LCP评估指标，以及基于SPSR-Graph的数据处理方法。

Result: 实验验证了评估指标在用户感知一致性上的优越性，以及数据预处理方法对模型性能的提升。

Conclusion: 提出的指标和方法有效解决了代码补全任务中的评估和建模问题。

Abstract: Code completion technology based on large language model has significantly
improved the development efficiency of programmers. However, in practical
applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion
evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we
propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP,
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency
information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose
a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and
Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis
and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the
effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.

### [753] [Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12304)
*Li Ni,Hengkai Xu,Lin Mu,Yiwen Zhang,Wenjian Luo*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PPCS的新模型，首次将“预训练-提示”范式应用于半监督社区搜索，以提高搜索准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督社区检测算法通常基于已知社区进行检测，且检测结果通常不包含查询节点，因此不适用于搜索给定节点的社区。

Method: PPCS包含三个主要组件：节点编码、样本生成和提示驱动微调。节点编码使用图神经网络学习节点局部结构模式；样本生成选择结构相似的已知社区作为训练样本；提示驱动微调利用这些样本作为提示指导最终社区预测。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，PPCS性能优于基线算法，且搜索效率更高。消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: PPCS通过结合预训练和提示驱动微调，显著提升了半监督社区搜索的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt" paradigm is widely adopted in various graph-based
tasks and has shown promising performance in community detection. Most existing
semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on
known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given
query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a
given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised
community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven
Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and
efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample
generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding
component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of
nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities.
Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a
given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the
initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning
component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community
prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that
PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher
community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline
methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of
PPCS.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语义和空间信息的k-core社区搜索方法，解决了现有方法仅关注单一属性（关键词或位置）且忽略交通时间变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社区搜索研究仅利用关键词或位置单一属性，导致社区语义或空间内聚性低，且未考虑交通时间变化。同时，现有方法需遍历整个网络，效率低下。

Method: 提出精确和贪心两种算法，从查询节点局部扩展，仅访问网络局部区域。利用大语言模型计算关键词语义相似度，避免关键词匹配的缺陷。

Result: 实验表明，贪心算法在结构、语义和时间依赖性空间内聚性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了社区搜索的语义和空间内聚性，同时提高了效率。

Abstract: Real-world networks often involve both keywords and locations, along with
travel time variations between locations due to traffic conditions. However,
most existing cohesive subgraph-based community search studies utilize a single
attribute, either keywords or locations, to identify communities. They do not
simultaneously consider both keywords and locations, which results in low
semantic or spatial cohesiveness of the detected communities, and they fail to
account for variations in travel time. Additionally, these studies traverse the
entire network to build efficient indexes, but the detected community only
involves nodes around the query node, leading to the traversal of nodes that
are not relevant to the community. Therefore, we propose the problem of
discovering semantic-spatial aware k-core, which refers to a k-core with high
semantic and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness containing the query node. To
address this problem, we propose an exact and a greedy algorithm, both of which
gradually expand outward from the query node. They are local methods that only
access the local part of the attributed network near the query node rather than
the entire network. Moreover, we design a method to calculate the semantic
similarity between two keywords using large language models. This method
alleviates the disadvantages of keyword-matching methods used in existing
community search studies, such as mismatches caused by differently expressed
synonyms and the presence of irrelevant words. Experimental results show that
the greedy algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of structural, semantic,
and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness.

Result: 实验验证表明HyperDet方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: HyperDet通过建模高阶关系，显著提升了谣言源检测的准确性。

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks,
particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise
interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source
detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately
address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study,
we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via
Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion.
Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction
module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions
among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which
autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a
self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations
under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive
experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach,
showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SourceDetMamba通过结合时序和结构信息，显著提升了谣言源检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying
rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to
capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present
SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in
Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space
model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and
computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first
employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks.
Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation
process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying
propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively
capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we
propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each
node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological
context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that
SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的投票预测框架（VPF），用于预测议会投票结果，包括议员个人投票和法案整体通过情况，准确率高达85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高政府透明度，简化议会工作，优化法案通过率。

Method: VPF框架包括数据收集、解析与特征整合、预测模型三个关键步骤，利用机器学习分析多国议会投票记录。

Result: VPF在预测个人投票和法案通过率上分别达到85%和84%的准确率。

Conclusion: VPF是一个有价值的工具，可用于政治分析、政策研究和提升公众对立法决策的访问。

Abstract: Keeping track of how lawmakers vote is essential for government transparency.
While many parliamentary voting records are available online, they are often
difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand legislative
behavior across parliaments and predict voting outcomes. Accurate prediction of
votes has several potential benefits, from simplifying parliamentary work by
filtering out bills with a low chance of passing to refining proposed
legislation to increase its likelihood of approval. In this study, we leverage
advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques to develop a
comprehensive framework for predicting parliamentary voting outcomes across
multiple legislatures. We introduce the Voting Prediction Framework (VPF) - a
data-driven framework designed to forecast parliamentary voting outcomes at the
individual legislator level and for entire bills. VPF consists of three key
components: (1) Data Collection - gathering parliamentary voting records from
multiple countries using APIs, web crawlers, and structured databases; (2)
Parsing and Feature Integration - processing and enriching the data with
meaningful features, such as legislator seniority, and content-based
characteristics of a given bill; and (3) Prediction Models - using machine
learning to forecast how each parliament member will vote and whether a bill is
likely to pass. The framework will be open source, enabling anyone to use or
modify the framework. To evaluate VPF, we analyzed over 5 million voting
records from five countries - Canada, Israel, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and
the USA. Our results show that VPF achieves up to 85% precision in predicting
individual votes and up to 84% accuracy in predicting overall bill outcomes.
These findings highlight VPF's potential as a valuable tool for political
analysis, policy research, and enhancing public access to legislative
decision-making.

Motivation: 由于缺乏反事实和比较，测量社会影响力具有挑战性。本文旨在通过SV提供一种新的测量方法。

Method: 结合机器学习建模和网络科学，SV利用外部回归器预测目标变量，生成合成影响力度量，并通过社交网络分配个体贡献。理论推导展示了SV在不同网络结构中的性质。

Result: 通过模拟发现，广义友谊悖论成立，即在某些情况下，朋友的平均影响力高于个体自身。

Conclusion: SV是一种有效的社会影响力测量方法，适用于政治行为等领域，并在计算上具有优势。

Abstract: Measuring social influence is difficult due to the lack of counter-factuals
and comparisons. By combining machine learning-based modeling and network
science, we present general properties of social value, a recent measure for
social influence using synthetic control applicable to political behavior.
Social value diverges from centrality measures on in that it relies on an
external regressor to predict an output variable of interest, generates a
synthetic measure of influence, then distributes individual contribution based
on a social network. Through theoretical derivations, we show the properties of
SV under linear regression with and without interaction, across lattice
networks, power-law networks, and random graphs. A reduction in computation can
be achieved for any ensemble model. Through simulation, we find that the
generalized friendship paradox holds -- that in certain situations, your
friends have on average more influence than you do.

Motivation: 探索SSL模型在SED中的协同潜力，指导模型选择和集成。

Method: 提出三种融合策略（单模态、双模态、全聚合），并引入nSEBBs后处理方法。

Result: 双模态融合（如CRNN+BEATs+WavLM）表现最佳，nSEBBs提升PSDS1达4%。

Conclusion: SSL模型具有兼容性和互补性，为SED系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for
sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains
underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models
to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a
framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT,
WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration,
dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4
Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves
complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best
results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound
event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that
dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for
standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and
complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific
fusion and robust SED system design.

Method: 提出浅层流匹配（SFM）机制，构建FM路径上的中间状态；训练时采用正交投影方法确定状态位置；推理时从中间状态开始，减少计算量。

Result: SFM显著提升语音自然度，并降低推理时间。

Conclusion: SFM是一种高效且有效的改进方法，适用于基于FM的TTS模型。

Abstract: We propose a shallow flow matching (SFM) mechanism to enhance flow matching
(FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation
paradigm. SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse
output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection
method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply
a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow.
The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and
focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into
multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments show that SFM
consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech in both objective
and subjective evaluations, while significantly reducing inference when using
adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at

Motivation: 现有研究对LALMs在语音和音频处理任务中的表现进行了广泛研究，但其多跳推理能力尚未系统评估。

Method: 引入SAKURA基准测试，评估LALMs基于语音和音频信息的多跳推理能力。

Result: LALMs难以整合语音/音频表征进行多跳推理，即使能正确提取相关信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LALMs在多模态推理中的关键限制，为未来研究提供了资源和方向。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with
multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on
speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning
abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the
ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation.
Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks,
conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning
based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to
integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they
extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental
challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in
LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

Motivation: 语音系统中的关键词识别需要持续学习新关键词，但传统方法因存储旧数据而面临隐私和资源限制。

Method: 提出AnalyticKWS方法，基于闭式解析解更新模型参数，无需梯度更新或存储旧数据。

Result: 实验表明AnalyticKWS在多种数据集和设置下优于现有持续学习方法。

Conclusion: AnalyticKWS解决了隐私和资源问题，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) offers a vital mechanism to identify spoken commands
in voice-enabled systems, where user demands often shift, requiring models to
learn new keywords continually over time. However, a major problem is
catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier
keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their
usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing
and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective,
these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user
data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small
devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic
Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without
revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS
computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only
a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer
computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store
old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental
learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS
meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings
well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that
AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GM-OT的方法，通过图匹配最优传输（Graph Matching Optimal Transport）来解决语言和声学模态之间的表示对齐问题，显著提升了端到端自动语音识别（E2E-ASR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最优传输（OT）方法在处理语言和声学特征对齐时忽略了结构关系，导致模态间的表示对齐效果不佳。

Method: GM-OT将语言和声学序列建模为结构化图，通过最小化节点间的Wasserstein距离（WD）和边间的Gromov-Wasserstein距离（GWD），实现更高效的知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，GM-OT在普通话ASR任务中显著优于现有最优传输方法。

Conclusion: GM-OT不仅提供了一种更有效的模态对齐方法，还将现有OT方法视为其特例，具有理论和实践的双重意义。

Abstract: Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to
acoustic feature learning has proven effective in enhancing end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR). However, aligning representations
between linguistic and acoustic modalities remains a challenge due to inherent
modality gaps. Optimal transport (OT) has shown promise in mitigating these
gaps by minimizing the Wasserstein distance (WD) between linguistic and
acoustic feature distributions. However, previous OT-based methods overlook
structural relationships, treating feature vectors as unordered sets. To
address this, we propose Graph Matching Optimal Transport (GM-OT), which models
linguistic and acoustic sequences as structured graphs. Nodes represent feature
embeddings, while edges capture temporal and sequential relationships. GM-OT
minimizes both WD (between nodes) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD)
(between edges), leading to a fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance (FGWD)
formulation. This enables structured alignment and more efficient knowledge
transfer compared to existing OT-based approaches. Theoretical analysis further
shows that prior OT-based methods in linguistic knowledge transfer can be
viewed as a special case within our GM-OT framework. We evaluate GM-OT on
Mandarin ASR using a CTC-based E2E-ASR system with a PLM for knowledge
transfer. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy
concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely
resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker
privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech
Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that
disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich
representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and
$\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables
high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's
semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while
removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both
representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction.
Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring
privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC
against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on
privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of
speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in
the learned semantic representations. Audio samples are shared in

Conclusion: HAKES是一种高性能、可扩展的向量数据库，适用于现代深度学习应用，已开源。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models capture the semantics of complex data by
transforming them into high-dimensional embedding vectors. Emerging
applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation, use approximate nearest
neighbor (ANN) search in the embedding vector space to find similar data.
Existing vector databases provide indexes for efficient ANN searches, with
graph-based indexes being the most popular due to their low latency and high
recall in real-world high-dimensional datasets. However, these indexes are
costly to build, suffer from significant contention under concurrent read-write
workloads, and scale poorly to multiple servers.
  Our goal is to build a vector database that achieves high throughput and high
recall under concurrent read-write workloads. To this end, we first propose an
ANN index with an explicit two-stage design combining a fast filter stage with
highly compressed vectors and a refine stage to ensure recall, and we devise a
novel lightweight machine learning technique to fine-tune the index parameters.
We introduce an early termination check to dynamically adapt the search process
for each query. Next, we add support for writes while maintaining search
performance by decoupling the management of the learned parameters. Finally, we
design HAKES, a distributed vector database that serves the new index in a
disaggregated architecture. We evaluate our index and system against 12

### [766] [Code Retrieval for MILP Instance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11526)
*Tianxing Yang,Huigen Ye,Hua Xu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将MILP实例生成任务重新定义为MILP代码生成任务的方法，通过代码实现高效、灵活且可解释的实例生成，并引入MILP-EmbedSim相似性度量和MILP-Retrieval流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MILP实例生成方法通常需要为每个问题类别训练单独模型且计算成本高，限制了学习型求解器的性能提升。

Method: 将MILP实例生成任务重新定义为代码生成任务，引入MILP-EmbedSim相似性度量和MILP-Retrieval流程。

Result: MILP-Retrieval在代码生成和实例生成任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为MILP实例生成提供了新视角，并为学习型求解器开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is widely used in fields such as
scheduling, logistics, and planning. Enhancing the performance of MILP solvers,
particularly learning-based solvers, requires substantial amounts of
high-quality data. However, existing methods for MILP instance generation
typically necessitate training a separate model for each problem class and are
computationally intensive when generating new instances. To address these
limitations, we reformulate the MILP Instance Generation task as MILP Code
Generation task, enabling efficient, flexible, and interpretable instance
generation through code. Since MILP instances generated from code can vary
significantly in scale, we introduce MILP-EmbedSim, a new similarity metric
that accurately measures the similarity between instances of varying sizes
within the same problem class. Leveraging this metric, we propose
MILP-Retrieval, a pipeline that retrieves generation code from library to
produce MILP instances highly similar to target instance. MILP-Retrieval
outperforms baselines in both MILP Code Generation and Instance Generation
tasks, provides a novel perspective on MILP instance generation and opens new
possibilities for learning-based solvers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在正交约束优化问题中减少计算成本的新方法，通过随机子流形更新变量，显著降低了每次迭代的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着变量规模增大，传统黎曼优化中的回缩操作计算成本过高，限制了其在大规模问题中的应用。

Method: 限制每次更新在随机子流形上进行，减少计算复杂度，并提出了两种随机子流形采样策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种问题上显著提升了计算效率，扩展了黎曼优化的适用范围。

Abstract: Optimization with orthogonality constraints frequently arises in various
fields such as machine learning. Riemannian optimization offers a powerful
framework for solving these problems by equipping the constraint set with a
Riemannian manifold structure and performing optimization intrinsically on the
manifold. This approach typically involves computing a search direction in the
tangent space and updating variables via a retraction operation. However, as
the size of the variables increases, the computational cost of the retraction
can become prohibitively high, limiting the applicability of Riemannian
optimization to large-scale problems. To address this challenge and enhance
scalability, we propose a novel approach that restricts each update on a random
submanifold, thereby significantly reducing the per-iteration complexity. We
introduce two sampling strategies for selecting the random submanifolds and
theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed methods. We provide
convergence results for general nonconvex functions and functions that satisfy
Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition as well as for stochastic optimization
settings. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to
quotient manifolds derived from the orthogonal manifold. Extensive experiments
verify the benefits of the proposed method, across a wide variety of problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哈密顿流优化（HF-opt）及其随机化版本（RHF）的收敛性能，探索其在优化问题中的潜力。

Method: HF-opt模拟哈密顿动力学并重置速度；RHF随机化积分时间；RHGD是RHF的离散实现。

Result: RHF在连续时间中实现加速收敛；RHGD与AGD在强凸和弱凸函数优化中性能相当，某些情况下更优。

Conclusion: RHGD是一种有竞争力的加速优化方法，性能与AGD相当甚至更优。

Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian flow for optimization (HF-opt), which simulates the
Hamiltonian dynamics for some integration time and resets the velocity to $0$
to decrease the objective function; this is the optimization analogue of the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling. For short integration time,
HF-opt has the same convergence rates as gradient descent for minimizing
strongly and weakly convex functions. We show that by randomizing the
integration time in HF-opt, the resulting randomized Hamiltonian flow (RHF)
achieves accelerated convergence rates in continuous time, similar to the rates
for the accelerated gradient flow. We study a discrete-time implementation of
RHF as the randomized Hamiltonian gradient descent (RHGD) algorithm. We prove
that RHGD achieves the same accelerated convergence rates as Nesterov's
accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for minimizing smooth strongly and weakly
convex functions. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate that RHGD is
competitive with classical accelerated methods such as AGD across all settings
and outperforms them in certain regimes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Nesterov加速梯度方法的离散状态采样算法，扩展了经典的Metropolis-Hastings算法，通过动量加速框架和交互粒子系统提高了采样效率。


<details>

Motivation: 传统Metropolis-Hastings算法在离散状态采样中效率较低，希望通过引入Nesterov加速梯度方法提升性能。

Method: 利用离散Wasserstein-2度量和动量加速框架设计采样算法，并通过交互粒子系统近似加速采样动态。

Result: 数值实验表明，该算法在采样高斯混合分布和超立方体分布时表现高效。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在离散状态采样中具有高效性和普适性，尤其在估计离散得分函数时无需归一化常数。

Abstract: We propose a class of discrete state sampling algorithms based on Nesterov's
accelerated gradient method, which extends the classical Metropolis-Hastings
(MH) algorithm. The evolution of the discrete states probability distribution
governed by MH can be interpreted as a gradient descent direction of the
Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, via a mobility function and a score
function. Specifically, this gradient is defined on a probability simplex
equipped with a discrete Wasserstein-2 metric with a mobility function. This
motivates us to study a momentum-based acceleration framework using damped
Hamiltonian flows on the simplex set, whose stationary distribution matches the
discrete target distribution. Furthermore, we design an interacting particle
system to approximate the proposed accelerated sampling dynamics. The extension
of the algorithm with a general choice of potentials and mobilities is also
discussed. In particular, we choose the accelerated gradient flow of the
relative Fisher information, demonstrating the advantages of the algorithm in
estimating discrete score functions without requiring the normalizing constant
and keeping positive probabilities. Numerical examples, including sampling on a
Gaussian mixture supported on lattices or a distribution on a hypercube,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed discrete-state sampling
algorithm.

Method: 开发了结构化审计框架，对X/Twitter、Reddit、TikTok和Meta进行比较分析，识别审计盲点。

Result: 发现“问责悖论”：平台依赖AI系统的同时限制了独立监督能力。

Conclusion: 建议基于NIST的AI风险管理框架，提出联邦访问模型和加强监管的政策干预。

Abstract: Recent application programming interface (API) restrictions on major social
media platforms challenge compliance with the EU Digital Services Act [20],
which mandates data access for algorithmic transparency. We develop a
structured audit framework to assess the growing misalignment between
regulatory requirements and platform implementations. Our comparative analysis
of X/Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, and Meta identifies critical ``audit
blind-spots'' where platform content moderation and algorithmic amplification
remain inaccessible to independent verification. Our findings reveal an
``accountability paradox'': as platforms increasingly rely on AI systems, they
simultaneously restrict the capacity for independent oversight. We propose
targeted policy interventions aligned with the AI Risk Management Framework of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology [80], emphasizing federated
access models and enhanced regulatory enforcement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于动态维度的AI治理框架（3A：决策权、过程自主性和问责制），以替代传统的静态分类治理方法，适应AI系统的动态发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于固定风险等级或人类监督模型的治理框架已无法适应AI系统的动态性和模糊边界，需要更灵活的治理方法。

Method: 提出‘维度治理’框架，通过动态跟踪3A（决策权、过程自主性和问责制）的分布，实现预调整和适应性分类。

Result: 维度治理能够更灵活地监控系统行为并预判风险，支持动态分类和适应性治理。

Conclusion: 维度治理为AI治理提供了更具弹性和前瞻性的路径，同时保留了分类的必要性，但基于动态维度实现更灵活的治理。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from static tools to dynamic agents, traditional
categorical governance frameworks -- based on fixed risk tiers, levels of
autonomy, or human oversight models -- are increasingly insufficient on their
own. Systems built on foundation models, self-supervised learning, and
multi-agent architectures increasingly blur the boundaries that categories were
designed to police. In this Perspective, we make the case for dimensional
governance: a framework that tracks how decision authority, process autonomy,
and accountability (the 3As) distribute dynamically across human-AI
relationships. A critical advantage of this approach is its ability to
explicitly monitor system movement toward and across key governance thresholds,
enabling preemptive adjustments before risks materialize. This dimensional
approach provides the necessary foundation for more adaptive categorization,
enabling thresholds and classifications that can evolve with emerging
capabilities. While categories remain essential for decision-making, building
them upon dimensional foundations allows for context-specific adaptability and
stakeholder-responsive governance that static approaches cannot achieve. We
outline key dimensions, critical trust thresholds, and practical examples
illustrating where rigid categorical frameworks fail -- and where a dimensional
mindset could offer a more resilient and future-proof path forward for both
governance and innovation at the frontier of artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 研究VAAs在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，以保护民主选举过程的公正性。

Method: 通过分析瑞士Smartvote的数据，测量11种操纵策略对政党推荐频率的影响。

Result: 操纵VAA参数（如匹配方法）可导致政党推荐频率变化高达105%；选择性使用问卷项可增加推荐频率261%；微调政党或候选人回答可增加248%。

Conclusion: 提出增强VAA抗操纵性的框架，为未来AI驱动的VAAs提供安全保障。

Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs) help millions of voters understand which
political parties or candidates best align with their views. This paper
explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process
when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation
strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA,
Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that
altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a
party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire
items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle
changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To
address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties
VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience
of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward
mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure
and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.

Result: 在模拟基准和真实世界数据（如阿尔茨海默病淀粉样蛋白成像）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免似然函数难解性的同时，保持了高预测精度和效率。

Abstract: We present a novel kernel-based method for learning multivariate stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). The method follows a two-step procedure: we
first estimate the drift term function, then the (matrix-valued) diffusion
function given the drift. Occupation kernels are integral functionals on a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that aggregate information over a
trajectory. Our approach leverages vector-valued occupation kernels for
estimating the drift component of the stochastic process. For diffusion
estimation, we extend this framework by introducing operator-valued occupation
kernels, enabling the estimation of an auxiliary matrix-valued function as a
positive semi-definite operator, from which we readily derive the diffusion
estimate. This enables us to avoid common challenges in SDE learning, such as
intractable likelihoods, by optimizing a reconstruction-error-based objective.
We propose a simple learning procedure that retains strong predictive accuracy
while using Fenchel duality to promote efficiency. We validate the method on
simulated benchmarks and a real-world dataset of Amyloid imaging in healthy and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects.

Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a principled approach to Bayesian
uncertainty quantification but are traditionally limited by the need for
full-batch gradient evaluations. We introduce a scalable variant by
incorporating Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) proposals
into SMC, enabling efficient mini-batch based sampling. Our resulting SMCSGHMC
algorithm outperforms standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and deep
ensembles across image classification, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and

and improves calibration, providing a flexible, scalable pathway for converting
pretrained neural networks into well-calibrated Bayesian models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel iterative method for missing data imputation
that sequentially reduces the mutual information between data and their
corresponding missing mask. Inspired by GAN-based approaches, which train
generators to decrease the predictability of missingness patterns, our method
explicitly targets the reduction of mutual information. Specifically, our
algorithm iteratively minimizes the KL divergence between the joint
distribution of the imputed data and missing mask, and the product of their
marginals from the previous iteration. We show that the optimal imputation
under this framework corresponds to solving an ODE, whose velocity field
minimizes a rectified flow training objective. We further illustrate that some
existing imputation techniques can be interpreted as approximate special cases
of our mutual-information-reducing framework. Comprehensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed
approach, demonstrating superior imputation performance.

Motivation: 现有的大多数图估计方法基于单属性模型，而多属性图模型中每个节点代表一个随机向量，需要更通用的方法。

Method: 使用惩罚对数似然目标函数，包括凸（稀疏组lasso）和非凸（log-sum和SCAD）惩罚函数，采用ADMM优化方法。

Result: 在合成数据中，稀疏组log-sum惩罚函数在F1分数和Hamming距离上显著优于lasso和SCAD惩罚函数。

Conclusion: 非凸惩罚函数在多属性图学习中具有优势，尤其是在高维设置下。

Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG)
of high-dimensional Gaussian vectors from multi-attribute data. Most existing
methods for graph estimation are based on single-attribute models where one
associates a scalar random variable with each node. In multi-attribute
graphical models, each node represents a random vector. In this paper we
provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning using
a penalized log-likelihood objective function. We consider both convex
(sparse-group lasso) and sparse-group non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped
absolute deviation (SCAD) penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach coupled with local
linear approximation to non-convex penalties is presented for optimization of
the objective function. For non-convex penalties, theoretical analysis
establishing local consistency in support recovery, local convexity and
precision matrix estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided under two
sets of sufficient conditions: with and without some irrepresentability
conditions. We illustrate our approaches using both synthetic and real-data
numerical examples. In the synthetic data examples the sparse-group log-sum
penalized objective function significantly outperformed the lasso penalized as
well as SCAD penalized objective functions with $F_1$-score and Hamming
distance as performance metrics.

Conclusion: 数值模拟表明，TS算法在合成和真实场景中与现有方法相比具有竞争力，为SRRB问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Stochastic rising rested bandit (SRRB) is a setting where the arms' expected
rewards increase as they are pulled. It models scenarios in which the
performances of the different options grow as an effect of an underlying
learning process (e.g., online model selection). Even if the bandit literature
provides specifically crafted algorithms based on upper-confidence bounds for
such a setting, no study about Thompson sampling TS-like algorithms has been
performed so far. The strong regularity of the expected rewards in the SRRB
setting suggests that specific instances may be tackled effectively using
adapted and sliding-window TS approaches. This work provides novel regret
analyses for such algorithms in SRRBs, highlighting the challenges and
providing new technical tools of independent interest. Our results allow us to
identify under which assumptions TS-like algorithms succeed in achieving
sublinear regret and which properties of the environment govern the complexity
of the regret minimization problem when approached with TS. Furthermore, we
provide a regret lower bound based on a complexity index we introduce. Finally,
we conduct numerical simulations comparing TS-like algorithms with
state-of-the-art approaches for SRRBs in synthetic and real-world settings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了传统统计因子模型对异常值的敏感性问题，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been a surge of interest in studying
low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional data. Statistical factor
models $-$ i.e., low-rank plus diagonal covariance structures $-$ offer a
powerful framework for modeling such structures. However, traditional methods
for fitting statistical factor models, such as principal component analysis
(PCA) or maximum likelihood estimation assuming the data is Gaussian, are
highly sensitive to heavy tails and outliers in the observed data. In this
paper, we propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for robustly
fitting statistical factor models. Our approach is based on Tyler's M-estimator
of the scatter matrix for an elliptical distribution, and consists of solving
Tyler's maximum likelihood estimation problem while imposing a structural
constraint that enforces the low-rank plus diagonal covariance structure. We
present numerical experiments on both synthetic and real examples,
demonstrating the robustness of our method for direction-of-arrival estimation
in nonuniform noise and subspace recovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel nonparametric method for estimating
high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices with multiple conditioning
covariates, leveraging random forests and supported by robust theoretical
guarantees. Unlike traditional static methods, our dynamic nonparametric
covariance models effectively capture distributional heterogeneity.
Furthermore, unlike kernel-smoothing methods, which are restricted to a single
conditioning covariate, our approach accommodates multiple covariates in a
fully nonparametric framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
method to use random forests for estimating high-dimensional dynamic covariance
matrices. In high-dimensional settings, we establish uniform consistency
theory, providing nonasymptotic error rates and model selection properties,
even when the response dimension grows sub-exponentially with the sample size.
These results hold uniformly across a range of conditioning variables. The
method's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations and a stock dataset
analysis, highlighting its ability to model complex dynamics in
high-dimensional scenarios.

Conclusion: WBGP-BO为解决高斯过程拟合问题提供了一种有效的新方法，尤其在复杂优化任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization is a widely applied algorithm to
learn and optimize under uncertainty, well-known for its sample efficiency.
However, recently -- and more frequently -- research studies have empirically
demonstrated that the Gaussian Process fitting procedure at its core could be
its most relevant weakness. Fitting a Gaussian Process means tuning its
kernel's hyperparameters to a set of observations, but the common Maximum
Likelihood Estimation technique, usually appropriate for learning tasks, has
shown different criticalities in Bayesian Optimization, making theoretical
analysis of this algorithm an open challenge. Exploiting the analogy between
Gaussian Processes and Gaussian Distributions, we present a new approach which
uses a prefixed set of hyperparameters values to fit as many Gaussian Processes
and then combines them into a unique model as a Wasserstein Barycenter of
Gaussian Processes. We considered both "easy" test problems and others known to
undermine the \textit{vanilla} Bayesian Optimization algorithm. The new method,
namely Wasserstein Barycenter Gausssian Process based Bayesian Optimization
(WBGP-BO), resulted promising and able to converge to the optimum, contrary to
vanilla Bayesian Optimization, also on the most "tricky" test problems.

Abstract: Multi-modal contrastive learning as a self-supervised representation learning
technique has achieved great success in foundation model training, such as
CLIP~\citep{radford2021learning}. In this paper, we study the theoretical
properties of the learned representations from multi-modal contrastive learning
beyond linear representations and specific data distributions. Our analysis
reveals that, enabled by temperature optimization, multi-modal contrastive
learning not only maximizes mutual information between modalities but also
adapts to intrinsic dimensions of data, which can be much lower than
user-specified dimensions for representation vectors. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of contrastive
learning to learn low-dimensional and informative representations, bridging
theoretical insights and practical performance.

Abstract: We introduce a new family of algorithms for detecting and estimating a
rank-one signal from a noisy observation under prior information about that
signal's direction, focusing on examples where the signal is known to have
entries biased to be positive. Given a matrix observation $\mathbf{Y}$, our
algorithms construct a nonlinear Laplacian, another matrix of the form
$\mathbf{Y} + \mathrm{diag}(\sigma(\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}))$ for a nonlinear
$\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, and examine the top eigenvalue and
eigenvector of this matrix. When $\mathbf{Y}$ is the (suitably normalized)
adjacency matrix of a graph, our approach gives a class of algorithms that
search for unusually dense subgraphs by computing a spectrum of the graph
"deformed" by the degree profile $\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}$. We study the
performance of such algorithms compared to direct spectral algorithms (the case
$\sigma = 0$) on models of sparse principal component analysis with biased
signals, including the Gaussian planted submatrix problem. For such models, we
rigorously characterize the critical threshold strength of rank-one signal, as
a function of the nonlinearity $\sigma$, at which an outlier eigenvalue appears
in the spectrum of a nonlinear Laplacian. While identifying the $\sigma$ that
minimizes this critical signal strength in closed form seems intractable, we
explore three approaches to design $\sigma$ numerically: exhaustively searching
over simple classes of $\sigma$, learning $\sigma$ from datasets of problem
instances, and tuning $\sigma$ using black-box optimization of the critical
signal strength. We find both theoretically and empirically that, if $\sigma$
is chosen appropriately, then nonlinear Laplacian spectral algorithms
substantially outperform direct spectral algorithms, while avoiding the
complexity of broader classes of algorithms like approximate message passing or
general first order methods.

Abstract: Transporting causal information learned from experiments in one population to
another is a critical challenge in clinical research and decision-making.
Causal transportability uses causal graphs to model differences between the
source and target populations and identifies conditions under which causal
effects learned from experiments can be reused in a different population.
Similarly, causal identifiability identifies conditions under which causal
effects can be estimated from observational data. However, these approaches
rely on knowing the causal graph, which is often unavailable in real-world
settings. In this work, we propose a Bayesian method for assessing whether
Z-specific (conditional) causal effects are both identifiable and
transportable, without knowing the causal graph. Our method combines
experimental data from the source population with observational data from the
target population to compute the probability that a causal effect is both
identifiable from observational data and transportable. When this holds, we
leverage both observational data from the target domain and experimental data
from the source domain to obtain an unbiased, efficient estimator of the causal
effect in the target population. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our
method correctly identifies transportable causal effects and improves causal
effect estimation.

Abstract: Distributional robustness is a central goal of prediction algorithms due to
the prevalent distribution shifts in real-world data. The prediction model aims
to minimize the worst-case risk among a class of distributions, a.k.a., an
uncertainty set. Causality provides a modeling framework with a rigorous
robustness guarantee in the above sense, where the uncertainty set is
data-driven rather than pre-specified as in traditional distributional
robustness optimization. However, current causality-inspired robustness methods
possess finite-radius robustness guarantees only in the linear settings, where
the causal relationships among the covariates and the response are linear. In
this work, we propose a nonlinear method under a causal framework by
incorporating recent developments in identifiable representation learning and
establish a distributional robustness guarantee. To our best knowledge, this is
the first causality-inspired robustness method with such a finite-radius
robustness guarantee in nonlinear settings. Empirical validation of the
theoretical findings is conducted on both synthetic data and real-world
single-cell data, also illustrating that finite-radius robustness is crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态系统中的前向不确定性量化因非光滑或局部振荡的非线性行为而具有挑战性，SDD虽能有效处理此类非线性，但其精度对内部节点位置高度敏感。

Method: 方法包括三步：(1) 插值输入-输出曲线，(2) 定义基于子区间的参考区域，(3) 在每个区域内选择梯度最大点作为最优节点位置。

Result: 在模态分析中，提出的SDD方法比均匀或随机节点分布的SDD及高斯过程代理模型精度更高，相对方差误差最低（2.89%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在数学函数和实际系统（如控制臂）的随机和可靠性分析中表现出高效性和可扩展性，仅需少量函数评估即可准确估计统计量和可靠性。

Abstract: Forward uncertainty quantification in dynamic systems is challenging due to
non-smooth or locally oscillating nonlinear behaviors. Spline dimensional
decomposition (SDD) effectively addresses such nonlinearity by partitioning
input coordinates via knot placement, yet its accuracy is highly sensitive to
the location of internal knots. Optimizing knots through sequential quadratic
programming can be effective, yet the optimization process becomes
computationally intense. We propose a computationally efficient,
interpolation-based method for optimal knot selection in SDD. The method
involves three steps: (1) interpolating input-output profiles, (2) defining
subinterval-based reference regions, and (3) selecting optimal knot locations
at maximum gradient points within each region. The resulting knot vector is
then applied to SDD for accurate approximation of non-smooth and locally
oscillating responses. A modal analysis of a lower control arm demonstrates
that SDD with the proposed knot selection achieves higher accuracy than SDD
with uniformly or randomly spaced knots, and also a Gaussian process surrogate
model. The proposed SDD exhibits the lowest relative variance error (2.89%),
compared to SDD with uniformly spaced knots (12.310%), randomly spaced knots
(15.274%), and Gaussian process (5.319%) in the first natural frequency
distribution. All surrogate models are constructed using the same 401
simulation datasets, and the relative errors are evaluated against a
2000-sample Monte Carlo simulation. The scalability and applicability of
proposed method are demonstrated through stochastic and reliability analyses of
mathematical functions (N=1, 3) and a lower control arm system (N=10). The
results confirm that both second-moment statistics and reliability estimates
can be accurately achieved with only a few hundred function evaluations or
finite element simulations.

Abstract: Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization (TVBO) is the go-to framework for
optimizing a time-varying black-box objective function that may be noisy and
expensive to evaluate. Is it possible for the instantaneous regret of a TVBO
algorithm to vanish asymptotically, and if so, when? We answer this question of
great theoretical importance by providing algorithm-independent lower regret
bounds and upper regret bounds for TVBO algorithms, from which we derive
sufficient conditions for a TVBO algorithm to have the no-regret property. Our
analysis covers all major classes of stationary kernel functions.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models constitute a widely utilized class of
ensemble learning approaches in statistics and machine learning, known for
their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have become integral
components in numerous state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures,
particularly for analyzing heterogeneous data across diverse domains. Despite
their practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection,
especially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts,
remains limited and poses significant challenges. These challenges primarily
stem from the inclusion of covariates in both the Gaussian gating functions and
expert networks, which introduces intrinsic interactions governed by partial
differential equations with respect to their parameters. In this paper, we
revisit the concept of dendrograms of mixing measures and introduce a novel
extension to Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models that enables consistent
estimation of the true number of mixture components and achieves the pointwise
optimal convergence rate for parameter estimation in overfitted scenarios.
Notably, this approach circumvents the need to train and compare a range of
models with varying numbers of components, thereby alleviating the
computational burden, particularly in high-dimensional or deep neural network
settings. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method in accurately recovering the number of experts. It
outperforms common criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, the
Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood, while
achieving optimal convergence rates for parameter estimation and accurately
approximating the regression function.

Abstract: Creating large-scale datasets for training high-performance generative models
is often prohibitively expensive, especially when associated attributes or
annotations must be provided. As a result, merging existing datasets has become
a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often
inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise
missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional
generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as
conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model
with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no
training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains
rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations.
We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where
it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional
distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.

Abstract: Counterfactuals play a pivotal role in the two distinct data science fields
of causal inference (CI) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While
the core idea behind counterfactuals remains the same in both fields--the
examination of what would have happened under different circumstances--there
are key differences in how they are used and interpreted. We introduce a formal
definition that encompasses the multi-faceted concept of the counterfactual in
CI and XAI. We then discuss how counterfactuals are used, evaluated, generated,
and operationalized in CI vs. XAI, highlighting conceptual and practical
differences. By comparing and contrasting the two, we hope to identify
opportunities for cross-fertilization across CI and XAI.

Abstract: High-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, energy, and public
policy are often made by human experts using domain knowledge and heuristics,
yet are increasingly supported by predictive and optimization-based tools. A
dominant approach in operations research is the predict-then-optimize paradigm,
where a predictive model estimates uncertain inputs, and an optimization model
recommends a decision. However, this approach often lacks interpretability and
can fail under distributional uncertainty -- particularly when the outcome
distribution is multi-modal or complex -- leading to brittle or misleading
decisions. In this paper, we introduce CREDO, a novel framework that
quantifies, for any candidate decision, a distribution-free upper bound on the
probability that the decision is suboptimal. By combining inverse optimization
geometry with conformal prediction and generative modeling, CREDO produces risk
certificates that are both statistically rigorous and practically
interpretable. This framework enables human decision-makers to audit and
validate their own decisions under uncertainty, bridging the gap between
algorithmic tools and real-world judgment.

Abstract: This paper considers the estimation of quantiles via a smoothed version of
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. By smoothing the score
function in the conventional SGD quantile algorithm, we achieve monotonicity in
the quantile level in that the estimated quantile curves do not cross. We
derive non-asymptotic tail probability bounds for the smoothed SGD quantile
estimate both for the case with and without Polyak-Ruppert averaging. For the
latter, we also provide a uniform Bahadur representation and a resulting
Gaussian approximation result. Numerical studies show good finite sample

Abstract: We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for
guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous
normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept
rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to
optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data
regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or
partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path
Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass
on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated
distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We
demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model,
guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states
and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges
thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a
principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning
in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency
and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and
beyond.

Result: 该方法在多种PDE问题上显著提升了性能，优于现有的NGD方法。

Conclusion: 随机Nyström预处理的矩阵自由NGD是一种高效且通用的优化方法，适用于神经网络求解PDEs。

Abstract: Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has emerged as a promising optimization
algorithm for training neural network-based solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However,
its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of solving
linear systems involving the Gramian matrix. While matrix-free NGD methods
based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method avoid explicit matrix inversion,
the ill-conditioning of the Gramian significantly slows the convergence of CG.
In this work, we extend matrix-free NGD to broader classes of problems than
previously considered and propose the use of Randomized Nystr\"om
preconditioning to accelerate convergence of the inner CG solver. The resulting
algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing
NGD-based methods on a range of PDE problems discretized using neural networks.

Motivation: 大规模矩阵应用中，矩阵存储和访问受限，现有方法（如Hutch++）难以适用。

Method: 提出BOLT方法，基于正交块探针和Lanczos迭代，并扩展为Subblock SLQ以适应部分访问。

Result: BOLT在性能上优于Hutch++，尤其在平坦谱区域，并适用于低内存和部分访问场景。

Conclusion: BOLT为受限环境提供了一种高效的矩阵迹估计框架，并扩展了KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离的计算方法。

Abstract: Efficient matrix trace estimation is essential for scalable computation of
log-determinants, matrix norms, and distributional divergences. In many
large-scale applications, the matrices involved are too large to store or
access in full, making even a single matrix-vector (mat-vec) product
infeasible. Instead, one often has access only to small subblocks of the matrix
or localized matrix-vector products on restricted index sets. Hutch++ achieves
optimal convergence rate but relies on randomized SVD and assumes full mat-vec
access, making it difficult to apply in these constrained settings. We propose
the Block-Orthonormal Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (BOLT), which matches
Hutch++ accuracy with a simpler implementation based on orthonormal block
probes and Lanczos iterations. BOLT builds on the Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature
(SLQ) framework, which combines random probing with Krylov subspace methods to
efficiently approximate traces of matrix functions, and performs better than
Hutch++ in near flat-spectrum regimes. To address memory limitations and
partial access constraints, we introduce Subblock SLQ, a variant of BOLT that
operates only on small principal submatrices. As a result, this framework
yields a proxy KL divergence estimator and an efficient method for computing
the Wasserstein-2 distance between Gaussians - both compatible with low-memory
and partial-access regimes. We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate
strong empirical performance across a range of high-dimensional settings.

polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to
trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the
groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a
central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general
not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the
nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD.
Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of
sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently
scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or
linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not
need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures,
using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable
nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor.

### [799] [Data Sharing with a Generative AI Competitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12386)
*Boaz Taitler,Omer Madmon,Moshe Tennenholtz,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了内容创作公司与GenAI平台之间的数据共享问题，发现公司可能愿意付费共享自身数据，形成高成本均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GenAI平台的发展，其对竞争内容提供商的依赖及替代数据源的访问带来了数据共享决策的新挑战。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈模型，公司决定共享多少专有数据，GenAI随后决定从外部专家获取多少额外数据。

Result: 发现公司可能付费共享自身数据，形成高成本均衡，并确定了帕累托改进的数据价格条件。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GenAI时代数据共享的经济机制，为平台、监管者和政策制定者提供了设计有效数据交换机制的指导。

Abstract: As GenAI platforms grow, their dependence on content from competing
providers, combined with access to alternative data sources, creates new
challenges for data-sharing decisions. In this paper, we provide a model of
data sharing between a content creation firm and a GenAI platform that can also
acquire content from third-party experts. The interaction is modeled as a
Stackelberg game: the firm first decides how much of its proprietary dataset to
share with GenAI, and GenAI subsequently determines how much additional data to
acquire from external experts. Their utilities depend on user traffic, monetary
transfers, and the cost of acquiring additional data from external experts. We
characterize the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the game and uncover a
surprising phenomenon: The firm may be willing to pay GenAI to share the firm's
own data, leading to a costly data-sharing equilibrium. We further characterize
the set of Pareto improving data prices, and show that such improvements occur
only when the firm pays to share data. Finally, we study how the price can be
set to optimize different design objectives, such as promoting firm data
sharing, expert data acquisition, or a balance of both. Our results shed light
on the economic forces shaping data-sharing partnerships in the age of GenAI,
and provide guidance for platforms, regulators and policymakers seeking to
design effective data exchange mechanisms.

*Drashthi Doshi,Aditya Vema Reddy Kesari,Swaprava Nath,Avishek Ghosh,Suhas S Kowshik*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种联邦学习（FL）中的激励机制，解决了客户端参与和贡献的理性问题，并通过两种机制实现参数学习和贡献激励的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习未考虑客户端参与的成本和激励问题，论文旨在同时实现参数学习和激励贡献。

Method: 提出两种机制：第一种通过纳什均衡激励贡献；第二种引入货币转移，实现预算平衡和最优参数学习。

Result: 实验表明，算法在真实数据集（CIFAR-10、FeMNIST、Twitter）上快速收敛，提供良好的福利保障和模型性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过激励机制解决了联邦学习中的贡献问题，并验证了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited
amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute
towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The
learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the
center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for
participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and
running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of
rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some
results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of
simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution, which
distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes
each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and
simultaneously learn the model parameters. However, this equilibrium outcome
can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and
the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism with
monetary transfers that is budget balanced and enables the full data
contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments
with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FeMNIST, and Twitter) show that these
algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees, and
better model performance for all agents.

Conclusion: 哈密顿动力学在博弈学习动态中具有揭示结构特性的潜力，为相关领域提供了新的研究途径。

Abstract: Understanding a dynamical system fundamentally relies on establishing an
appropriate Hamiltonian function and elucidating its symmetries. By formulating
agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables,
we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix
zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the
associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability
and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the
system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by
introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving
convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate
convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian
dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games,
and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game
theory and machine learning.

Result: 在基于LLM的多智能体系统（如ChatGPT和Llama 3）中，该方法能高效识别中毒智能体，同时减少误报。

Conclusion: 该研究为多智能体系统安全性提供了新思路，有助于开发更健壮、可信的AI交互。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems leverage advanced AI models as autonomous agents that
interact, cooperate, or compete to complete complex tasks across applications
such as robotics and traffic management. Despite their growing importance,
safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research
focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work
investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a
defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning
abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical
reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based
multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying
poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe
this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to
the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的多智能体系统开发依赖手工方法，缺乏系统性设计和优化的研究，OMAC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出OMAC框架，包括五个优化维度，并设计两种算法：单维度优化的“语义初始化器”和“对比比较器”，以及多维度联合优化算法。

Result: 实验显示OMAC在代码生成、算术推理和通用推理任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OMAC为LLM-based MAS的系统性优化提供了有效框架，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Agents powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across diverse complex applications. Recently,
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate
with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as
high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development
of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on
systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited.
  In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic
optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization
dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration
structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general
algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the
Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an
algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation,
arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art
approaches.

Result: IG Parser能够高效地解析和转换制度性规则，支持多样化的分析方法。

Conclusion: IG Parser是一个强大的工具，适用于制度分析的多种场景，其语法和架构设计使其具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This article provides an overview of IG Parser, a software that facilitates
qualitative content analysis of formal (e.g., legal) rules or informal (e.g.,
socio-normative) norms, and strategies (such as conventions) -- referred to as
\emph{institutions} -- that govern social systems and operate configurally to
describe \emph{institutional systems}. To this end, the IG Parser employs a
distinctive syntax that ensures rigorous encoding of natural language, while
automating the transformation into various formats that support the downstream
analysis using diverse analytical techniques. The conceptual core of the IG
Parser is an associated syntax, IG Script, that operationalizes the conceptual
foundations of the Institutional Grammar, and more specifically Institutional
Grammar 2.0, an analytical paradigm for institutional analysis. This article
presents the IG Parser, including its conceptual foundations, syntactic
specification of IG Script, alongside architectural principles. This
introduction is augmented with selective illustrative examples that highlight
the use and benefit associated with the tool.

Conclusion: 为设计自适应、可扩展的多智能体系统奠定了基础，将焦点从结构新颖性转向策略交互机制。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing
complex, distributed tasks in large language model (LLM)-driven applications.
While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the
granular mechanisms governing agents, critical to performance and scalability,
remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of
collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3)
interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous
experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios: Distributed Evidence
Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES), we quantify the
impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency.
Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation,
ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization
collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource
utilization with the support of the proposed Token-Accuracy Ratio (TAR). This
work establishes a foundation for designing adaptive, scalable multi-agent
systems, shifting the focus from structural novelty to strategic interaction
mechanics.

TL;DR: PIBT是一种轻量级算法，用于多智能体路径规划（MAPF），通过两种简单的技术改进其决策效果，提升解决方案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PIBT在决策时的多种最优动作选择问题，通过改进决策技术提升路径规划效果。

Method: 提出两种技术：1）智能避让其他智能体；2）通过多次运行学习动作对其他智能体的影响，最小化集体后悔。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术能显著降低单次MAPF的成本，提升长期MAPF的吞吐量，成本减少10-20%。

Conclusion: 两种技术在不显著影响速度的情况下，显著提升了PIBT的解决方案质量。

Abstract: PIBT is a computationally lightweight algorithm that can be applied to a
variety of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, generating the next
collision-free locations of agents given another. Because of its simplicity and
scalability, it is becoming a popular underlying scheme for recent large-scale
MAPF methods involving several hundreds or thousands of agents. Vanilla PIBT
makes agents behave greedily towards their assigned goals, while agents
typically have multiple best actions, since the graph shortest path is not
always unique. Consequently, tiebreaking about how to choose between these
actions significantly affects resulting solutions. This paper studies two
simple yet effective techniques for tiebreaking in PIBT, without compromising
its computational advantage. The first technique allows an agent to
intelligently dodge another, taking into account whether each action will
hinder the progress of the next timestep. The second technique is to learn,
through multiple PIBT runs, how an action causes regret in others and to use
this information to minimise regret collectively. Our empirical results
demonstrate that these techniques can reduce the solution cost of one-shot MAPF
and improve the throughput of lifelong MAPF. For instance, in densely populated
one-shot cases, the combined use of these tiebreaks achieves improvements of
around 10-20% in sum-of-costs, without significantly compromising the speed of
a PIBT-based planner.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）常面临视野范围问题，即智能体从环境中获取的信息不足或过多，影响性能。

Method: 采用动态视野范围选择（DSR）方法，结合UCB算法，在训练过程中动态调整智能体的视野范围。

Result: 实验表明，DSR在LBF、RWARE和SMAC等环境中表现优异，能提升QMIX和MAPPO等算法的性能，并加速训练过程。

Conclusion: DSR提供了一种不依赖全局信息或通信机制的实用解决方案，适用于复杂现实环境。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement Learning (MARL) is often challenged by the sight
range dilemma, where agents either receive insufficient or excessive
information from their environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
called Dynamic Sight Range Selection (DSR), to address this issue. DSR utilizes
an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and dynamically adjusts the sight
range during training. Experiment results show several advantages of using DSR.
First, we demonstrate using DSR achieves better performance in three common
MARL environments, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF), Multi-Robot Warehouse
(RWARE), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). Second, our results show
that DSR consistently improves performance across multiple MARL algorithms,
including QMIX and MAPPO. Third, DSR offers suitable sight ranges for different
training steps, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, DSR
provides additional interpretability by indicating the optimal sight range used
during training. Unlike existing methods that rely on global information or
communication mechanisms, our approach operates solely based on the individual
sight ranges of agents. This approach offers a practical and efficient solution
to the sight range dilemma, making it broadly applicable to real-world complex
environments.

Abstract: Even though high-level synthesis (HLS) tools mitigate the challenges of

Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and

Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various
tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential
domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining
adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on
the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$

Abstract: Accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads requires efficient methods due
to their large optimization space. Autotuning has emerged as an effective
approach for systematically evaluating variations of implementations.
Traditionally, autotuning requires the workloads to be executed on the target
hardware (HW). We present an interface that allows executing autotuning
workloads on simulators. This approach offers high scalability when the
availability of the target HW is limited, as many simulations can be run in
parallel on any accessible HW. Additionally, we evaluate the feasibility of
using fast instruction-accurate simulators for autotuning. We train various
predictors to forecast the performance of ML workload implementations on the
target HW based on simulation statistics. Our results demonstrate that the
tuned predictors are highly effective. The best workload implementation in
terms of actual run time on the target HW is always within the top 3 % of
predictions for the tested x86, ARM, and RISC-V-based architectures. In the
best case, this approach outperforms native execution on the target HW for
embedded architectures when running as few as three samples on three simulators
in parallel.

Abstract: There has been substantial progress in the inference of formal behavioural
specifications from sample trajectories, for example, using Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL). However, these techniques cannot handle specifications that
correctly characterise systems with stochastic behaviour, which occur commonly
in reinforcement learning and formal verification. We consider the passive
learning problem of inferring a Boolean combination of probabilistic LTL (PLTL)
formulas from a set of Markov chains, classified as either positive or
negative. We propose a novel learning algorithm that infers concise PLTL
specifications, leveraging grammar-based enumeration, search heuristics,
probabilistic model checking and Boolean set-cover procedures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm in two use cases: learning from policies
induced by RL algorithms and learning from variants of a probabilistic model.
In both cases, our method automatically and efficiently extracts PLTL
specifications that succinctly characterise the temporal differences between
the policies or model variants.

Abstract: [Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified
formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies
in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal
information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas
to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical
components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along
with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical
deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A
meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on
this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical
safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the
equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the
assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error.
[Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless
information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and
processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information
fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or
multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of
fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for
systematically addressing the critical challenges currently faced in machine
learning.

### [1] [Prompt Engineering: How Prompt Vocabulary affects Domain Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17037)
*Dimitri Schreiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，提示词的具体性对LLM在特定领域任务中的表现影响有限，但存在一个最优具体性范围，能最大化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示词具体性对LLM在STEM、医学和法律领域任务表现的影响。

Method: 开发同义词替换框架，测试四种LLM在不同具体性提示下的表现。

Result: 提示词具体性提升无显著影响，但存在最优具体性范围能提升性能。

Conclusion: 优化提示词具体性范围可提升LLM在专业领域的应用效率。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in optimizing large
language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. However, the role of prompt
specificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology,
computer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored.
This thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of
vocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific
question-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework
to systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying
specificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,
Granite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in
STEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the
specificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be
a specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the
best. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for
prompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could
maximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized
domains.

### [2] [Signals from the Floods: AI-Driven Disaster Analysis through Multi-Source Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17038)
*Xian Gong,Paul X. McCarthy,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用X（原Twitter）和公共调查提交的数据，分析公众在极端天气事件中的行为模式，结合LDA和LLMs方法优化危机相关内容筛选，提升应急响应效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索社交媒体和公共调查数据在政府灾害响应中的作用，特别是在2022年新南威尔士州洪水事件中。

Method: 整合LDA进行主题建模，结合LLMs增强语义理解，通过相关性指数方法筛选和优先处理可操作内容。

Result: LDA揭示了不同的意见和地理模式，LLMs提高了洪水相关推文的识别准确性，减少了噪音。

Conclusion: 结合互补数据流，该方法为实时灾害响应和长期韧性规划提供了新的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Massive and diverse web data are increasingly vital for government disaster
response, as demonstrated by the 2022 floods in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia. This study examines how X (formerly Twitter) and public inquiry
submissions provide insights into public behaviour during crises. We analyse
more than 55,000 flood-related tweets and 1,450 submissions to identify
behavioural patterns during extreme weather events. While social media posts
are short and fragmented, inquiry submissions are detailed, multi-page
documents offering structured insights. Our methodology integrates Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. LDA reveals distinct opinions and
geographic patterns, while LLMs improve filtering by identifying flood-relevant
tweets using public submissions as a reference. This Relevance Index method
reduces noise and prioritizes actionable content, improving situational
awareness for emergency responders. By combining these complementary data
streams, our approach introduces a novel AI-driven method to refine
crisis-related social media content, improve real-time disaster response, and
inform long-term resilience planning.

### [3] [A new classification system of beer categories and styles based on large-scale data mining and self-organizing maps of beer recipes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17039)
*Diego Bonatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据驱动的啤酒分类系统，通过分析62,121种啤酒配方，结合统计方法和自组织映射（SOM），识别出四大超级集群，揭示了不同发酵温度下啤酒的原料使用差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统啤酒分类主要依赖感官评价，缺乏客观性和可重复性。本研究旨在通过数据驱动的方法，建立一个可量化的分类框架，为酿酒师、研究人员和教育工作者提供更科学的工具。

Method: 研究分析了62,121种啤酒配方的原料、发酵参数和关键统计数据，结合统计分析和自组织映射（SOM）方法，识别出四大超级集群。

Result: 研究发现了四大超级集群，冷发酵啤酒的原料使用较为保守，而热发酵啤酒则表现出高度异质性，反映了区域偏好和创新。

Conclusion: 新分类系统提供了一个可重复、客观的框架，超越了传统感官分类，为啤酒配方分析和开发提供了可扩展的工具，并揭示了原料使用与发酵特性及风味结果的关联。

Abstract: A data-driven quantitative approach was used to develop a novel
classification system for beer categories and styles. Sixty-two thousand one
hundred twenty-one beer recipes were mined and analyzed, considering ingredient
profiles, fermentation parameters, and recipe vital statistics. Statistical
analyses combined with self-organizing maps (SOMs) identified four major
superclusters that showed distinctive malt and hop usage patterns, style
characteristics, and historical brewing traditions. Cold fermented styles
showed a conservative grain and hop composition, whereas hot fermented beers
exhibited high heterogeneity, reflecting regional preferences and innovation.
This new taxonomy offers a reproducible and objective framework beyond
traditional sensory-based classifications, providing brewers, researchers, and
educators with a scalable tool for recipe analysis and beer development. The
findings in this work provide an understanding of beer diversity and open
avenues for linking ingredient usage with fermentation profiles and flavor
outcomes.

### [4] [VLM-KG: Multimodal Radiology Knowledge Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17042)
*Abdullah Abdullah,Seong Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，用于生成放射学知识图谱，解决了现有单模态方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学知识图谱生成面临专业语言和领域数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法仅基于报告且无法处理长文本。

Method: 采用多模态VLM框架，结合放射学报告和影像数据生成知识图谱。

Result: 新方法优于现有方法，首次实现了多模态放射学知识图谱生成。

Conclusion: 多模态VLM框架为放射学知识图谱生成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural
language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output
generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as
valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks.
However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant
challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited
availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly
unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports
while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form
radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation
in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the
first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.

### [5] [QRA++: Quantified Reproducibility Assessment for Common Types of Results in Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17043)
*Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QRA++是一种定量评估NLP领域可重复性的方法，提供多粒度连续评估，支持跨研究比较，并揭示实验相似性与可重复性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域的可重复性研究结论难以比较和解释，因为缺乏统一的评估标准。

Method: 提出QRA++方法，通过三个粒度级别的连续值评估可重复性，并使用可比性指标。

Result: 应用QRA++发现可重复性受实验相似性、系统类型和评估方法影响。

Conclusion: QRA++为可重复性评估提供了更信息化的方法，有助于理解可重复性差异的原因。

Abstract: Reproduction studies reported in NLP provide individual data points which in
combination indicate worryingly low levels of reproducibility in the field.
Because each reproduction study reports quantitative conclusions based on its
own, often not explicitly stated, criteria for reproduction success/failure,
the conclusions drawn are hard to interpret, compare, and learn from. In this
paper, we present QRA++, a quantitative approach to reproducibility assessment
that (i) produces continuous-valued degree of reproducibility assessments at
three levels of granularity; (ii) utilises reproducibility measures that are
directly comparable across different studies; and (iii) grounds expectations
about degree of reproducibility in degree of similarity between experiments.
QRA++ enables more informative reproducibility assessments to be conducted, and
conclusions to be drawn about what causes reproducibility to be better/poorer.
We illustrate this by applying QRA++ to three example sets of comparable
experiments, revealing clear evidence that degree of reproducibility depends on
similarity of experiment properties, but also system type and evaluation
method.

### [6] [Assessing GPT's Bias Towards Stigmatized Social Groups: An Intersectional Case Study on Nationality Prejudice and Psychophobia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17045)
*Afifah Kashif,Heer Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-3.5/4/4o等大型语言模型对特定国籍（如朝鲜）和弱势群体（如精神障碍者）存在显著偏见，尤其在交叉身份情境下表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在国籍和精神障碍交叉身份下的伦理问题。

Method: 通过结构化提示序列评估模型对不同国籍（美国与朝鲜）及精神障碍情境的响应。

Result: 模型对朝鲜国籍和精神障碍者表现出更强的负面偏见，共情水平显著不均衡。

Conclusion: 需改进模型设计，以更细致地处理交叉身份问题。

Abstract: Recent studies have separately highlighted significant biases within
foundational large language models (LLMs) against certain nationalities and
stigmatized social groups. This research investigates the ethical implications
of these biases intersecting with outputs of widely-used GPT-3.5/4/4o LLMS.
Through structured prompt series, we evaluate model responses to several
scenarios involving American and North Korean nationalities with various mental
disabilities. Findings reveal significant discrepancies in empathy levels with
North Koreans facing greater negative bias, particularly when mental disability
is also a factor. This underscores the need for improvements in LLMs designed
with a nuanced understanding of intersectional identity.

### [7] [Assessing the Quality of AI-Generated Clinical Notes: A Validated Evaluation of a Large Language Model Scribe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17047)
*Erin Palm,Astrit Manikantan,Mark E. Pepin,Herprit Mahal,Srikanth Subramanya Belwadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种盲法研究，比较大型语言模型（LLM）生成的临床笔记与专家笔记的质量，发现两者差异微小，支持使用PDQI9工具评估AI笔记质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏评估AI临床笔记质量的标准方法，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用盲法研究，使用PDQI9工具评估LLM生成的笔记与专家笔记的质量，涉及5个医学领域的专家评分。

Result: Gold笔记（专家）得分为4.25/5，Ambient笔记（LLM）得分为4.20/5，差异显著但微小；评分者间一致性高。

Conclusion: PDQI9工具适用于评估LLM生成的临床笔记质量，AI笔记与人类笔记质量接近。

Abstract: In medical practices across the United States, physicians have begun
implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform the
function of scribes in order to reduce the burden of documenting clinical
encounters. Despite their widespread use, no established methods exist to gauge
the quality of AI scribes. To address this gap, we developed a blinded study
comparing the relative performance of large language model (LLM) generated
clinical notes with those from field experts based on audio-recorded clinical
encounters. Quantitative metrics from the Physician Documentation Quality
Instrument (PDQI9) provided a framework to measure note quality, which we
adapted to assess relative performance of AI generated notes. Clinical experts
spanning 5 medical specialties used the PDQI9 tool to evaluate
specialist-drafted Gold notes and LLM authored Ambient notes. Two evaluators
from each specialty scored notes drafted from a total of 97 patient visits. We
found uniformly high inter rater agreement (RWG greater than 0.7) between
evaluators in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and
moderate (RWG 0.5 to 0.7) to high inter rater agreement in pediatrics and
cardiology. We found a modest yet significant difference in the overall note
quality, wherein Gold notes achieved a score of 4.25 out of 5 and Ambient notes
scored 4.20 out of 5 (p = 0.04). Our findings support the use of the PDQI9
instrument as a practical method to gauge the quality of LLM authored notes, as
compared to human-authored notes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WCB数据集，用于分析全球25家央行的货币政策，标注了三项任务，并测试了多种语言模型，发现跨银行数据训练的模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 央行政策解读对经济稳定至关重要，但误读可能对弱势群体造成不均衡影响，因此需要更全面的数据集和分析方法。

Method: 构建WCB数据集，标注三项任务（立场检测、时间分类、不确定性估计），并测试16种语言模型（7种PLMs和9种LLMs）。

Result: 跨银行数据训练的模型显著优于单一银行数据训练的模型，验证了整体优于部分的原则。

Conclusion: WCB数据集和框架具有经济实用性，数据和分析工具已开源。

Abstract: Central banks around the world play a crucial role in maintaining economic
stability. Deciphering policy implications in their communications is
essential, especially as misinterpretations can disproportionately impact
vulnerable populations. To address this, we introduce the World Central Banks
(WCB) dataset, the most comprehensive monetary policy corpus to date,
comprising over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across diverse geographic
regions, spanning 28 years of historical data. After uniformly sampling 1k
sentences per bank (25k total) across all available years, we annotate and
review each sentence using dual annotators, disagreement resolutions, and
secondary expert reviews. We define three tasks: Stance Detection, Temporal
Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation, with each sentence annotated for
all three. We benchmark seven Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and nine Large
Language Models (LLMs) (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and with annotation guide) on
these tasks, running 15,075 benchmarking experiments. We find that a model
trained on aggregated data across banks significantly surpasses a model trained
on an individual bank's data, confirming the principle "the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts." Additionally, rigorous human evaluations, error
analyses, and predictive tasks validate our framework's economic utility. Our
artifacts are accessible through the HuggingFace and GitHub under the
CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

### [9] [Gender and Positional Biases in LLM-Based Hiring Decisions: Evidence from Comparative CV/Résumé Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17049)
*David Rozado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在评估简历时存在性别偏好，倾向于选择女性候选人，且易受提示顺序影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在职业候选人评估中的行为，揭示其潜在的性别偏见和决策逻辑问题。

Method: 实验涉及22个LLM，通过系统性地交换简历中的性别信息，观察模型的选择偏好。

Result: LLM普遍偏好女性候选人，性别中立标识可消除偏见，但存在位置偏差。

Conclusion: 需谨慎在高风险决策中使用LLM，其决策可能缺乏一致性原则。

Abstract: This study examines the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when
evaluating professional candidates based on their resumes or curricula vitae
(CVs). In an experiment involving 22 leading LLMs, each model was
systematically given one job description along with a pair of
profession-matched CVs, one bearing a male first name, the other a female first
name, and asked to select the more suitable candidate for the job. Each CV pair
was presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences
in candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical
professional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored
female-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit
gender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for
female applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral
identifiers "Candidate A" and "Candidate B", several models displayed a
preference to select "Candidate A". Counterbalancing gender assignment between
these gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate
selection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs
assigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect
size was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a
candidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected
regardless of gender. Finally, most models exhibited a substantial positional
bias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. These findings
underscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous
decision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply
principled reasoning.

### [10] [Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17050)
*Yanhao Jia,Xinyi Wu,Qinglin Zhang,Yiran Qin,Luwei Xiao,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBLBench是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估基于领域知识和长上下文理解的复杂推理能力，填补了现有基准在自由形式输出结构和专家验证方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在教育任务中的评估缺乏自由形式输出结构和严格的专家验证，且模型幻觉和不稳定性限制了自动化管道的开发。

Method: 采用层次分析法（AHP）通过专家驱动的成对比较建立结构化加权评估标准，并评估了15种领先的MLLMs/LLMs的性能。

Result: 即使最先进的模型在PBLBench上的排名准确率仅为59%，表明该基准具有显著挑战性。

Conclusion: PBLBench有望推动更强大AI代理的发展，减轻教师负担并提升教育生产力。

Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated
multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM
disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such
as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in
educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both
a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process,
limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks.
Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the
complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model
hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To
address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context
understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble
those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise
comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess
the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that
even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the
significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will
serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately
aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E2P是一种参数高效的方法，通过将预计算的上下文嵌入注入LLM的隐藏表示空间，实现个性化输出，同时避免昂贵的微调或提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化LLM输出是一个挑战，现有方法成本高或效率低。

Method: 提出Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P)，通过学习投影将预计算嵌入注入LLM的隐藏空间，生成单个软令牌前缀。

Result: 在多个数据集和生产环境中，E2P表现优异，保留了上下文信号且计算开销低。

Conclusion: E2P为生成式AI系统提供了一种可扩展、高效的个性化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating contextually relevant
content. However, tailoring these outputs to individual users for effective
personalization is a significant challenge. While rich user-specific
information often exists as pre-existing user representations, such as
embeddings learned from preferences or behaviors, current methods to leverage
these for LLM personalization typically require costly fine-tuning or
token-heavy prompting. We propose Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P), a
parameter-efficient method that injects pre-computed context embeddings into an
LLM's hidden representation space through a learned projection to a single soft
token prefix. This enables effective personalization while keeping the backbone
model frozen and avoiding expensive adaptation techniques. We evaluate E2P
across two public datasets and in a production setting: dialogue
personalization on Persona-Chat, contextual headline generation on PENS, and
large-scale personalization for music and podcast consumption. Results show
that E2P preserves contextual signals and achieves strong performance with
minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable, efficient solution for
contextualizing generative AI systems.

*Jinwoo Park,Seunggeun Cho,Dongsu Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecEdge是一种边缘辅助推理框架，通过将LLM工作负载分配到边缘和服务器GPU上，利用推测解码方案提高效率和降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前以服务器为中心的系统忽视了边缘的消费级GPU资源，导致LLM服务的成本高且资源密集。

Method: 采用推测解码方案，在边缘和服务器之间分配工作负载，并通过主动边缘草拟和管道感知调度优化性能。

Result: 实验显示，SpecEdge将整体成本效率提升1.91倍，服务器吞吐量提高2.22倍，并减少11.24%的令牌间延迟。

Conclusion: SpecEdge为LLM服务提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but serving them
at scale remains costly and resource-intensive. Current server-centric systems
overlook consumer-grade GPUs at the edge. We introduce SpecEdge, an
edge-assisted inference framework that splits LLM workloads between edge and
server GPUs using a speculative decoding scheme, exchanging only token outputs
over the network. SpecEdge employs proactive edge drafting to overlap edge
token creation with server verification and pipeline-aware scheduling that
interleaves multiple user requests to increase server-side throughput.
Experiments show SpecEdge enhances overall cost efficiency by 1.91x through
achieving 2.22x server throughput, and reduces inter token latency by 11.24%
compared to a server-only baseline, introducing a scalable, cost-effective
paradigm for LLM serving.

*Ou Jiamin,Eikmans Emile,Buskens Vincent,Pankowska Paulina,Shan Yuli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社交交换情境中的表现，发现它们能展现信任和互惠行为，但受角色设定影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在模拟人类社交互动中的能力，特别是在经济信任游戏中如何平衡自利与信任。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4、Claude和Bard三种LLMs参与经济信任游戏，观察其在不同角色设定下的决策行为。

Result: LLMs在无特定角色设定时表现出信任和互惠，但在自私角色设定下低于人类水平；ChatGPT-4在无私角色中表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs的社交行为受角色设定影响较大，其互动推理能力尚不稳定，但部分模型在特定设定下表现优于人类。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in understanding human languages, this study explores how they translate this
understanding into social exchange contexts that capture certain essences of
real world human interactions. Three LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard - were
placed in economic trust games where players balance self-interest with trust
and reciprocity, making decisions that reveal their social preferences and
interactive reasoning abilities. Our study shows that LLMs deviate from pure
self-interest and exhibit trust and reciprocity even without being prompted to
adopt a specific persona. In the simplest one-shot interaction, LLMs emulated
how human players place trust at the beginning of such a game. Larger
human-machine divergences emerged in scenarios involving trust repayment or
multi-round interactions, where decisions were influenced by both social
preferences and interactive reasoning. LLMs responses varied significantly when
prompted to adopt personas like selfish or unselfish players, with the impact
outweighing differences between models or game types. Response of ChatGPT-4, in
an unselfish or neutral persona, resembled the highest trust and reciprocity,
surpassing humans, Claude, and Bard. Claude and Bard displayed trust and
reciprocity levels that sometimes exceeded and sometimes fell below human
choices. When given selfish personas, all LLMs showed lower trust and
reciprocity than humans. Interactive reasoning to the actions of counterparts
or changing game mechanics appeared to be random rather than stable,
reproducible characteristics in the response of LLMs, though some improvements
were observed when ChatGPT-4 responded in selfish or unselfish personas.

### [14] [METHOD: Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17054)
*Linglong Qian,Zina Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为METHOD的新型Transformer架构，专为电子健康记录中的临床序列建模设计，解决了传统Transformer在医疗领域的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的数据（如患者时间线）具有不规则采样、复杂时间依赖性和上下文关系，传统自然语言处理方法难以直接适用。

Method: METHOD结合了三种创新：患者感知注意力机制、自适应滑动窗口注意力方案和动态跳跃连接的U-Net架构。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据库上，METHOD表现优于现有模型ETHOS，尤其在预测高严重性病例和长序列处理方面表现稳定。

Conclusion: METHOD为医疗领域的Transformer应用提供了更准确、高效的解决方案，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionised natural
language processing, but their application to healthcare domains presents
unique challenges. Patient timelines are characterised by irregular sampling,
variable temporal dependencies, and complex contextual relationships that
differ substantially from traditional language tasks. This paper introduces
\METHOD~(Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery), a novel
transformer architecture specifically designed to address the challenges of
clinical sequence modelling in electronic health records. \METHOD~integrates
three key innovations: (1) a patient-aware attention mechanism that prevents
information leakage whilst enabling efficient batch processing; (2) an adaptive
sliding window attention scheme that captures multi-scale temporal
dependencies; and (3) a U-Net inspired architecture with dynamic skip
connections for effective long sequence processing. Evaluations on the MIMIC-IV
database demonstrate that \METHOD~consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
\ETHOS~model, particularly in predicting high-severity cases that require
urgent clinical intervention. \METHOD~exhibits stable performance across
varying inference lengths, a crucial feature for clinical deployment where
patient histories vary significantly in length. Analysis of learned embeddings

Abstract: AI is transforming education by enabling powerful tools that enhance learning
experiences. Among recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) hold
particular promise for revolutionizing how learners interact with educational
content. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to support
standardized test preparation by focusing on English Standardized Tests (ESTs).
Specifically, we assess their ability to generate accurate and contextually
appropriate solutions across a diverse set of EST question types. We introduce
ESTBOOK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of
LLMs in solving EST questions. ESTBOOK aggregates five widely recognized tests,
encompassing 29 question types and over 10,576 questions across multiple
modalities, including text, images, audio, tables, and mathematical symbols.
Using ESTBOOK, we systematically evaluate both the accuracy and inference
efficiency of LLMs. Additionally, we propose a breakdown analysis framework
that decomposes complex EST questions into task-specific solution steps. This
framework allows us to isolate and assess LLM performance at each stage of the
reasoning process. Evaluation findings offer insights into the capability of
LLMs in educational contexts and point toward targeted strategies for improving
their reliability as intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Domain-specific QA systems require not just generative fluency but high
factual accuracy grounded in structured expert knowledge. While recent
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve context recall, they
struggle with integrating heterogeneous data and maintaining reasoning
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose DO-RAG, a scalable and
customizable hybrid QA framework that integrates multi-level knowledge graph
construction with semantic vector retrieval. Our system employs a novel agentic
chain-of-thought architecture to extract structured relationships from
unstructured, multimodal documents, constructing dynamic knowledge graphs that
enhance retrieval precision. At query time, DO-RAG fuses graph and vector
retrieval results to generate context-aware responses, followed by
hallucination mitigation via grounded refinement. Experimental evaluations in
the database and electrical domains show near-perfect recall and over 94%
answer relevancy, with DO-RAG outperforming baseline frameworks by up to
33.38%. By combining traceability, adaptability, and performance efficiency,
DO-RAG offers a reliable foundation for multi-domain, high-precision QA at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有全双工对话系统中模块化架构导致的错误累积和关键挑战（如上下文相关打断和回声消除）问题。

Method: 引入动态思考机制，使LLM能够自主切换听和说状态，无需音频编解码器。

Result: 在语音问答和开放域对话基准测试中，性能提升30%，并在复杂对话场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SALMONN-omni为全双工语音交互提供了高效且简化的解决方案，性能接近半双工和轮转系统。

Abstract: In order to enable fluid and natural human-machine speech interaction,
existing full-duplex conversational systems often adopt modular architectures
with auxiliary components such as voice activity detectors, interrupters,
conversation state predictors, or multiple LLMs. These systems, however, suffer
from error accumulation across modules and struggle with key challenges such as
context-dependent barge-in and echo cancellation. Recent approaches, most
notably Moshi, simplify the pipeline by injecting audio codecs into the token
space of a single LLM. However, such methods still incur significant
performance degradation when operating on the speech rather than text modality.
In this paper, we introduce SALMONN-omni, the first single, standalone
full-duplex speech LLM that operates without audio codecs in its token space.
It features a novel dynamic thinking mechanism within the LLM backbone,
enabling the model to learn when to transition between speaking and listening
states. Experiments on widely used benchmarks for spoken question answering and
open-domain dialogue show that SALMONN-omni achieves at least 30\% relative
performance improvement over existing open-source full-duplex models and
performs highly competitively to half-duplex and turn-based systems, despite
using substantially less training data. Moreover, SALMONN-omni demonstrates
strong performance in complex conversational scenarios, including turn-taking,
backchanneling, echo cancellation and context-dependent barge-in, with further
improvements achieved through reinforcement learning. Some demo conversations
between user and SALMONN-omni are provided in the following repository

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉任务中表现出色，但仍受幻觉问题困扰，需要有效解决方案。

Method: MoD通过评估模型对图像标记的关注正确性，动态选择互补或对比策略来增强关键信息或抑制误导信息。

Result: 实验表明，MoD在多个主流基准测试中显著优于现有解码方法，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: MoD是一种有效的幻觉缓解方法，为大型视觉语言模型的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent
challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture
of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that
dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the
model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency
between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from
the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness
aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention,
MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information.
Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention,
MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing
decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating
hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖大规模人类标注数据，限制了广泛应用。本文旨在通过合成数据减少这种依赖，实现高效模型适应。

Method: 1. 从任务定义和检索文档生成问答对；2. 根据模型可解性调整问题难度；3. 基于模型平均通过率选择问题用于RL训练。

Result: 在多个任务上表现优异，如GSM8K提升29.2%，MATH提升8.7%，GPQA提升13.1%，且接近全人类数据RL的性能。

Conclusion: Synthetic Data RL通过减少人类数据标注需求，实现了可扩展且高效的模型适应，展示了合成数据的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to
specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits
broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework
that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a
task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the
task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the
question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average
pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our
method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9
pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on
GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA
(finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and
nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on
GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only
by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation,
Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease
research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of
rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that
leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis,
treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs
textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic,
imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We
review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in
identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent
conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of
accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges
and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy,
model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of
this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes
multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for
diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases. We conclude with
future perspectives on the evolution of LLMs towards truly multimodal
platforms, which would integrate diverse data types to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of rare diseases, ultimately fostering better
outcomes in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于多语言和多图片环境下轻度认知障碍（MCI）检测的框架，通过对比学习、图像模态融合和专家乘积策略，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对英语单图片描述，而多语言和多图片环境下的MCI检测面临新挑战，需要更全面的分析方法。

Method: 框架包含三个部分：1) 通过监督对比学习增强表征学习；2) 引入图像模态；3) 使用专家乘积策略减少虚假相关性和过拟合。

Result: 与文本单模态基线相比，UAR提高了7.1%（68.1%至75.2%），F1分数提高了2.9%（80.6%至83.5%）。

Conclusion: 该框架在多语言和多图片环境下有效提升了MCI检测性能，尤其是对比学习对文本模态的提升更显著。

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet
challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior
work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture
(e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by
introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new
challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges,
we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative
representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving
image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and
(3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious
correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance,
achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to
75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the
text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields
greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight
our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线健康讨论中用户毒性行为常引发社会冲突或传播危险行为，传统检测方法效果有限且可能适得其反。

Method: 采用基于协同过滤的机器学习方法，预测用户在Reddit子社区中的毒性行为。

Result: 在COVID相关讨论中，预测性能超过80%，成功避免冲突用户与子社区的配对。

Conclusion: 预测性方法比传统检测更有效，能提前预防毒性行为。

Abstract: In health-related topics, user toxicity in online discussions frequently
becomes a source of social conflict or promotion of dangerous, unscientific
behaviour; common approaches for battling it include different forms of
detection, flagging and/or removal of existing toxic comments, which is often
counterproductive for platforms and users alike. In this work, we propose the
alternative of combatting user toxicity predictively, anticipating where a user
could interact toxically in health-related online discussions. Applying a
Collaborative Filtering-based Machine Learning methodology, we predict the
toxicity in COVID-related conversations between any user and subcommunity of
Reddit, surpassing 80% predictive performance in relevant metrics, and allowing
us to prevent the pairing of conflicting users and subcommunities.

Method: 引入词尾标记和延迟惩罚，使用辅助网络实现帧级语音活动检测。

Result: 在Switchboard语料库上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效改善EP延迟和错误，提升用户体验。

Abstract: ASR endpointing (EP) plays a major role in delivering a good user experience
in products supporting human or artificial agents in human-human/machine
conversations. Transducer-based ASR (T-ASR) is an end-to-end (E2E) ASR
modelling technique preferred for streaming. A major limitation of T-ASR is
delayed emission of ASR outputs, which could lead to errors or delays in EP.
Inaccurate EP will cut the user off while speaking, returning incomplete
transcript while delays in EP will increase the perceived latency, degrading
the user experience. We propose methods to improve EP by addressing delayed
emission along with EP mistakes. To address the delayed emission problem, we
introduce an end-of-word token at the end of each word, along with a delay
penalty. The EP delay is addressed by obtaining a reliable frame-level speech
activity detection using an auxiliary network. We apply the proposed methods on
Switchboard conversational speech corpus and evaluate it against a delay
penalty method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型如何将提示的整体信息压缩到嵌入中，尤其是非事实性内容（如风格）的编码方式。

Method: 使用文学作品片段（10-100个词）分析其在潜在空间中的分布，比较不同作者和同一作者作品的嵌入关系。

Result: 发现短文本在潜在空间中的分布与下一词预测无关，同一作者的作品嵌入更相似，表明嵌入编码了风格特征。

Conclusion: 语言模型的信息处理和压缩能力非常复杂，潜在空间中的风格几何可用于作者归属和文学分析。

Abstract: Large language models use high-dimensional latent spaces to encode and
process textual information. Much work has investigated how the conceptual
content of words translates into geometrical relationships between their vector
representations. Fewer studies analyze how the cumulative information of an
entire prompt becomes condensed into individual embeddings under the action of
transformer layers. We use literary pieces to show that information about
intangible, rather than factual, aspects of the prompt are contained in deep
representations. We observe that short excerpts (10 - 100 tokens) from
different novels separate in the latent space independently from what
next-token prediction they converge towards. Ensembles from books from the same
authors are much more entangled than across authors, suggesting that embeddings
encode stylistic features. This geometry of style may have applications for
authorship attribution and literary analysis, but most importantly reveals the
sophistication of information processing and compression accomplished by
language models.

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络在摘要任务中的信息选择和压缩机制提供了新见解，连接了黑盒评估与机制理解之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research seeks to reveal the inner workings of
large language models, yet most work focuses on classification or generative
tasks rather than summarization. This paper presents an interpretability
framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. We
conduct differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models,
quantifying changes in attention patterns and internal activations. By
identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant
transformation, we locate the "summarization circuit" within the model
architecture. Our findings reveal that middle layers (particularly 2, 3, and 5)
exhibit the most dramatic changes, with 62% of attention heads showing
decreased entropy, indicating a shift toward focused information selection. We
demonstrate that targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits achieves
significant performance improvement over standard LoRA fine-tuning while
requiring fewer training epochs. This work bridges the gap between black-box
evaluation and mechanistic understanding, providing insights into how neural
networks perform information selection and compression during summarization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LAPS-SD的半预见性请求调度算法，用于优化LLM推理中的请求调度，显著降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于预测输出长度估计执行时间，忽略了LLM验证的令牌接受率对执行时间的影响，导致调度效率低下。

Method: 提出LAPS-SD算法，通过动态优先级队列和请求抢占机制，适应令牌接受率的变化，准确估计执行时间并调度请求。

Result: 实验表明，LAPS-SD相比现有最优调度方法，平均推理延迟降低了约39%。

Conclusion: LAPS-SD在动态令牌接受率环境下能有效优化请求调度，显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by
employing a small speculative model (SSM) to generate multiple candidate tokens
and verify them using the LLM in parallel. This technique has been widely
integrated into LLM inference serving systems. However, inference requests
typically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge
of efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates
execution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be
inaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token
acceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a
semi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called
Least-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a
number of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average
inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features
during decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time
is difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows
request execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance
rate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and
schedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces
inference latency by approximately 39\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling
methods.

Abstract: This study aimed to develop and validate two scales of engagement and rapport
to evaluate the user experience quality with multimodal dialogue systems in the
context of foreign language learning. The scales were designed based on
theories of engagement in educational psychology, social psychology, and second
language acquisition.Seventy-four Japanese learners of English completed
roleplay and discussion tasks with trained human tutors and a dialog agent.
After each dialogic task was completed, they responded to the scales of
engagement and rapport. The validity and reliability of the scales were
investigated through two analyses. We first conducted analysis of Cronbach's
alpha coefficient and a series of confirmatory factor analyses to test the
structural validity of the scales and the reliability of our designed items. We
then compared the scores of engagement and rapport between the dialogue with
human tutors and the one with a dialogue agent. The results revealed that our
scales succeeded in capturing the difference in the dialogue experience quality
between the human interlocutors and the dialogue agent from multiple
perspectives.

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally
serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While
low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of
frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we
investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining
Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at
different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech
recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence
speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay
between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features.
The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech
tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech,
and other speech-related applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中毒性生成的机制，并提出了一种轻量级的去毒方法GloSS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将前馈网络（FFN）视为毒性的主要来源，但本文发现全局毒性子空间能更全面地表征毒性区域。

Method: 提出了GloSS（全局毒性子空间抑制）方法，通过识别并移除FFN参数中的全局毒性子空间来减轻毒性。

Result: 实验表明，GloSS在多种LLMs上实现了最先进的去毒效果，同时保留了模型的通用能力，且无需大规模数据或模型重训练。

Conclusion: GloSS是一种高效且轻量的去毒方法，为LLMs的毒性问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of toxicity generation in
Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes an effective detoxification approach.
Prior work typically considers the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as the main
source of toxicity, representing toxic regions as a set of toxic vectors or
layer-wise subspaces. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that the global
toxic subspace offers a more effective and comprehensive representation of
toxic region within the model. Building on this insight, we propose GloSS
(Global Toxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight, four-stage method that
mitigates toxicity by identifying and removing the global toxic subspace from
the parameters of FFN. Experiments across a range of LLMs show that GloSS
achieves state-of-the-art detoxification performance while preserving the
models general capabilities, without requiring large-scale data or model
retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战主流将LLMs视为认知系统的观点，避免拟人化，更准确地理解LLMs如何参与文化过程。

Method: 通过理论分析和实际案例，展示LLMs作为符号学代理的功能，其输出可被视为解释性行为。

Result: LLMs作为符号学工具，在文学、哲学、教育等领域具有应用潜力，促进创造力、对话和批判性探究。

Conclusion: 符号学范式为研究和使用LLMs提供了更严谨和伦理的框架，将其重新定义为符号生态中的技术参与者。

Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models
(LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that
situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and
meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate
human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine,
recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic
associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid
anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate
in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite
interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper
demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated
as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection.
We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural
production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue,
and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated,
contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous
and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this
approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of
signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make
meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language,
interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of
knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效对齐策略，提升摩洛哥阿拉伯语（Darija）在开源大语言模型（LLMs）中的表现，同时保持模型的跨语言推理能力。通过翻译和混合指令训练，显著提升了Darija的性能，且计算成本极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型对摩洛哥阿拉伯语（Darija）支持不足，现有方法要么需要额外适配器，要么牺牲推理能力。本文旨在通过高质量对齐策略解决这一问题。

Method: 将三个紧凑指令集（LIMA 1K、DEITA 6K、TULU 50K）翻译为Darija，保留部分英文原指令，并添加数学、编程和科学提示。使用LoRA微调Gemma模型，训练混合指令。

Result: Gemma 3-4B模型在5K混合指令训练后，DarijaMMLU得分从32.8提升至42.7；加入TULU指令后进一步升至47.5。GemMaroc-27B在DarijaMMLU上达到61.6，超越Atlas-Chat。

Conclusion: 通过高效对齐策略，显著提升了Darija在LLMs中的表现，同时保持模型的数学和通用推理能力。训练成本低，为绿色AI提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) still marginalise Moroccan Arabic
(Darija), forcing practitioners either to bolt on heavyweight Arabic adapters
or to sacrifice the very reasoning skills that make LLMs useful. We show that a
rigorously quality-over-quantity alignment strategy can surface fluent Darija
while safeguarding the backbone s cross-lingual reasoning at a sliver of the
usual compute. We translate three compact instruction suites LIMA 1 K, DEITA 6
K and TULU 50 K into Darija, preserve 20 of the English originals, and add
mathematics, coding and scientific prompts. A LoRA-tuned Gemma 3-4B trained on
5 K mixed instructions lifts DarijaMMLU from 32.8 to 42.7 ; adding the
reasoning-dense TULU portion pushes it to 47.5 with no English regression.
Scaling the identical recipe to Gemma 3-27B produces GemMaroc-27B, which
matches Atlas-Chat on DarijaMMLU (61.6 ) and leaps ahead on Darija commonsense,
scoring 60.5 on HellaSwag versus Atlas-Chat s 48.4 . Crucially, GemMaroc
retains Gemma-27B s strong maths and general-reasoning ability, showing only
minimal movement on GSM8K and English benchmarks. The entire model is trained
in just 48 GPU.h, underscoring a Green AI pathway to inclusive, sustainable
language technology. We release code, data and checkpoints to spur
Darija-centric applications in education, public services and everyday digital
interaction.

Motivation: 解决LLM研究中注意力机制从短上下文训练推广到长上下文推理的挑战。

Method: 提出两个条件：尺度不变的总注意力和稀疏性，并在高斯假设下通过简单的位置相关变换实现。

Result: 实验表明，尺度不变的注意力方案在零样本推广和长上下文检索中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的尺度不变注意力机制能有效解决长上下文推理问题。

Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention
mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to
inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all
effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total
attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption,
we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits
is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the
resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms
of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts
to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.

Motivation: LLMs在问答任务中因缺乏事实知识和推理能力而受限，现有检索增强方法依赖于上下文学习，性能受限于LLMs的基本推理能力。

Method: 提出Mujica框架，包含问题分解为子问题的规划器和通过检索与推理解决问题的执行器；引入MyGO强化学习方法，用MLE替代传统策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了Mujica-MyGO能有效提升LLMs在多跳问答任务中的性能。

Conclusion: Mujica-MyGO为复杂问答任务提供了可扩展且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility, due to
the lack of factual knowledge, their application to Question Answering (QA)
tasks remains hindered by hallucination.
  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by integrating
external knowledge, existing approaches rely heavily on in-context learning,
whose performance is constrained by the fundamental reasoning capabilities of
LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence for Complex
Question Answering, comprising a planner that decomposes questions into a
directed acyclic graph of subquestions and a worker that resolves questions via
retrieval and reasoning. Additionally, we introduce MyGO (Minimalist policy
Gradient Optimization), a novel reinforcement learning method that replaces
traditional policy gradient updates with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) by
sampling trajectories from an asymptotically optimal policy. MyGO eliminates
the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, ensuring stable and
efficient training.
  Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
Mujica-MyGO in enhancing multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs, offering a
scalable and resource-efficient solution for complex QA tasks.

informatics. It begins with a historical overview and a critical review of
traditional classification frameworks such as NOVA, Nutri-Score, and SIGA,
highlighting their strengths and limitations, particularly the subjectivity and
reproducibility challenges that hinder epidemiological research and public

score. It also explores how large language models like BERT and BioBERT can
semantically embed food descriptions and ingredient lists for predictive tasks,
even in the presence of missing data. A key contribution of the chapter is a
novel case study using the Open Food Facts database, showcasing how multimodal
AI models can integrate structured and unstructured data to classify foods at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE)的框架，通过Chain-of-Thought推理增强LLMs的鲁棒性和流畅性，显著降低了攻击成功率和毒性内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在多种安全风险，现有防御方法通常只针对单一威胁或牺牲用户体验。

Method: ASE利用Chain-of-Thought推理，引导LLMs在生成响应前自我生成对抗场景并制定防御策略。

Result: 在四个对抗基准测试中，ASE实现了接近零的攻击成功率和极低的毒性内容，同时将直接拒绝率降至4%以下。

Conclusion: ASE通过将对抗感知转化为内在认知过程，为安全自然的人机交互设定了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, but remain
susceptible to a growing spectrum of safety risks, including jailbreaks, toxic
content, hallucinations, and bias. Existing defenses often address only a
single threat type or resort to rigid outright rejection, sacrificing user
experience and failing to generalize across diverse and novel attacks. This
paper introduces Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE), a novel
inference-time computation framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to simultaneously enhance LLM robustness and seamlessness. ASE guides
the LLM through a self-generative process of contemplating potential
adversarial scenarios and formulating defensive strategies before generating a
response to the user query. Comprehensive evaluation on four adversarial
benchmarks with four latest LLMs shows that ASE achieves near-zero jailbreak
attack success rates and minimal toxicity, while slashing outright rejections
to <4%. ASE outperforms six state-of-the-art defenses in
robustness-seamlessness trade-offs, with 92-99% accuracy on adversarial Q&A and
4-10x lower bias scores. By transforming adversarial perception into an
intrinsic cognitive process, ASE sets a new paradigm for secure and natural
human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: 文本LLM具有强大的内部电路，可通过激活必要连接应用于多任务，减少从头训练的需求。

Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM
model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability
to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear
just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models
to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other
hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as
input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a
classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio
classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working
for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image
patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal
circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various
applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Motivation: 由于LLM在临床笔记生成中的自然变异性可能影响准确性和隐私保护，研究旨在评估其可靠性以增强医疗提供者的信任。

Method: 评估12种LLM在生成临床笔记时的一致性率、语义一致性和语义相似性，使用相同提示多次迭代。

Result: 所有LLM家族均表现稳定，语义一致；Meta的Llama 70B和Mistral的Small模型最接近专家笔记。

Conclusion: 建议本地部署较小的开源模型，以确保数据隐私合规性并提升临床文档效率。

Abstract: Due to the legal and ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers (HCPs)
for accurate documentation and protection of patient data privacy, the natural
variability in the responses of large language models (LLMs) presents
challenges for incorporating clinical note generation (CNG) systems, driven by
LLMs, into real-world clinical processes. The complexity is further amplified
by the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in
tools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight
and proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms
of their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency
rate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic
similarity), across several iterations using the same prompt. The results show
that (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are
semantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of
the LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts.
Overall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small
model. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these
relatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data
privacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical
documentation.

Motivation: 多模态上下文学习（ICL）的效果高度依赖输入序列的质量，但目前对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）如何利用这些序列的理解有限。

Method: 通过任务映射视角系统分析ICL，提出TACO模型，利用任务感知注意力动态配置上下文序列，并将任务映射信号注入自回归解码过程。

Result: 在五个LVLMs和九个数据集上的实验表明，TACO在多种ICL任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 任务映射为理解和改进多模态ICL提供了有价值的视角。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for
harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input in-context
sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended
generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs
actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we
systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which
reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations
guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight
transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically
configures in-context sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the
autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between
sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine
datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse
ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a valuable perspective for
interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Motivation: 预训练生成模型在脑解码中取得了进展，但其输出的可靠性存疑，可能只是模型的幻觉而非真实的脑语义激活。

Method: 提出Generative Language Inspection Model (GLIM)，通过学习信息丰富且可解释的EEG表征，改进语义基础。

Result: 在ZuCo数据集上，GLIM能生成流畅且基于EEG的句子，支持更鲁棒的评估方法。

Conclusion: GLIM为生成式脑解码提供了可靠且可扩展的基准框架。

Abstract: Pretrained generative models have opened new frontiers in brain decoding by
enabling the synthesis of realistic texts and images from non-invasive brain
recordings. However, the reliability of such outputs remains
questionable--whether they truly reflect semantic activation in the brain, or
are merely hallucinated by the powerful generative models. In this paper, we
focus on EEG-to-text decoding and address its hallucination issue through the
lens of posterior collapse. Acknowledging the underlying mismatch in
information capacity between EEG and text, we reframe the decoding task as
semantic summarization of core meanings rather than previously verbatim
reconstruction of stimulus texts. To this end, we propose the Generative
Language Inspection Model (GLIM), which emphasizes learning informative and
interpretable EEG representations to improve semantic grounding under
heterogeneous and small-scale data conditions. Experiments on the public ZuCo
dataset demonstrate that GLIM consistently generates fluent, EEG-grounded
sentences without teacher forcing. Moreover, it supports more robust evaluation
beyond text similarity, through EEG-text retrieval and zero-shot semantic
classification across sentiment categories, relation types, and corpus topics.
Together, our architecture and evaluation protocols lay the foundation for
reliable and scalable benchmarking in generative brain decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估工具存在偏见问题，现有方法（如上下文学习或微调）无法完全解决，尤其是对闭源模型。因此，需要一种外部且通用的解决方案。

Method: 开发了RBD模块，通过构建偏见数据集、监督收集、基于推理的微调，并与LLM评估器集成，实现偏见检测和自纠正。

Result: 实验表明，RBD在不同规模和类型的偏见上均表现优异，例如RBD-8B模型将评估准确性平均提升18.5%，一致性提升10.9%。

Conclusion: RBD是一种高效、可扩展且通用的方法，能够显著改善LLM评估的偏见问题，适用于多种偏见类型和领域。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising tool for automatically evaluating
generated outputs, but its reliability is often undermined by potential biases
in judgment. Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations:
in-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the
evaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not
applicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address
this challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is
a plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured
reasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the
evaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process
of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we
design a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction,
supervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and
integration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging
from 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all
scales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon,
and sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong
effectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an
average of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based
baselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively. These results
highlight RBD's effectiveness and scalability. Additional experiments further
demonstrate its strong generalization across biases and domains, as well as its
efficiency.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络如何在不同领域（如图像与文本）中为语义相关数据生成相似表示，并探索其信息编码机制。

Method: 通过测量语义相关数据表示的信息内容，分析LLMs和视觉变换器中语义层的特征，包括语言可迁移性、信息分布和因果不对称性。

Result: 发现LLMs中存在包含最多语言可迁移信息的内部语义层，且较大模型（DeepSeek-V3）提取的信息更通用。语义信息分布在多个token中，具有长距离相关性和因果不对称性。视觉变换器中也有类似语义层，且文本表示能预测图像表示。

Conclusion: 语义信息在LLMs和视觉变换器中以特定方式编码，揭示了跨领域表示相似性的机制，并展示了模型规模对信息提取的影响。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for
semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as
an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We
present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring
the relative information content of the representations of semantically related
data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language
models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs
of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the
most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers,
a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than
a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information is spread across many tokens
and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a
causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers
encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption
representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations
of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent
information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
natural language processing tasks. However, most LLM models use traditional
tokenizers like BPE and SentencePiece, which fail to capture the finer nuances
of a morphologically rich language like Bangla (Bengali). In this work, we
introduce BanglaByT5, the first byte-level encoder-decoder model explicitly
tailored for Bangla. Built upon a small variant of Googles ByT5 architecture,
BanglaByT5 is pre-trained on a 14GB curated corpus combining high-quality
literary and newspaper articles. Through zeroshot and supervised evaluations
across generative and classification tasks, BanglaByT5 demonstrates competitive
performance, surpassing several multilingual and larger models. Our findings
highlight the efficacy of byte-level modelling for morphologically rich
languages and highlight BanglaByT5 potential as a lightweight yet powerful tool
for Bangla NLP, particularly in both resource-constrained and scalable

TL;DR: SDForger是一个高效灵活的框架，利用LLMs生成高质量多元时间序列，通过少量样本和低计算微调实现，并在多样数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成模型在多元时间序列生成中的局限性，提供更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Method: 将单变量和多变量信号转换为表格嵌入，编码为文本后微调LLM，生成保留原始数据统计特性和时间动态的合成时间序列。

Result: 在多种数据集上，SDForger在相似性评估和下游预测任务中优于现有生成模型。

Conclusion: SDForger为多模态建模和时间序列与文本信息的整合提供了新途径，其源代码将开源。

Abstract: SDForger is a flexible and efficient framework for generating high-quality
multivariate time series using LLMs. Leveraging a compact data representation,
SDForger provides synthetic time series generation from a few samples and
low-computation fine-tuning of any autoregressive LLM. Specifically, the
framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular
embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At
inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time
series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal
dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing
generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and
downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the
generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the
streamlined integration of time series with textual information. SDForger
source code will be open-sourced soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术海报的手动制作耗时，现有自动化方法难以保留科学细节和实现有效的视觉-文本整合，缺乏标准化评估基准。

Method: P2P采用三个专门智能体（视觉元素处理、内容生成、海报组装）和检查模块，支持迭代优化。同时发布P2PInstruct数据集和P2PEval评估基准。

Result: P2P展示了实际应用的潜力，生成了高质量的HTML渲染海报。P2PInstruct包含30,000+高质量示例，P2PEval提供了121对论文-海报和双重评估方法。

Conclusion: P2P框架及其配套工具（数据集和评估基准）旨在简化研究传播，并为社区提供开发和评估下一代海报生成系统的工具。

Abstract: Academic posters are vital for scholarly communication, yet their manual
creation is time-consuming. However, automated academic poster generation faces
significant challenges in preserving intricate scientific details and achieving
effective visual-textual integration. Existing approaches often struggle with
semantic richness and structural nuances, and lack standardized benchmarks for
evaluating generated academic posters comprehensively. To address these
limitations, we introduce P2P, the first flexible, LLM-based multi-agent
framework that generates high-quality, HTML-rendered academic posters directly
from research papers, demonstrating strong potential for practical
applications. P2P employs three specialized agents-for visual element
processing, content generation, and final poster assembly-each integrated with
dedicated checker modules to enable iterative refinement and ensure output
quality. To foster advancements and rigorous evaluation in this domain, we
construct and release P2PInstruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset
comprising over 30,000 high-quality examples tailored for the academic
paper-to-poster generation task. Furthermore, we establish P2PEval, a
comprehensive benchmark featuring 121 paper-poster pairs and a dual evaluation
methodology (Universal and Fine-Grained) that leverages LLM-as-a-Judge and
detailed, human-annotated checklists. Our contributions aim to streamline
research dissemination and provide the community with robust tools for
developing and evaluating next-generation poster generation systems.

TL;DR: RRTL是一种专门用于评估推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在工具学习中的安全性的红队方法，揭示了RLLMs的安全性和欺骗性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新兴推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在工具学习中的安全性问题，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出RRTL方法，包括识别欺骗性威胁和利用Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示强制工具调用，并建立传统LLMs的基准。

Result: 评估七种主流RLLMs，发现其安全性优于传统LLMs但仍存在显著差异，且存在欺骗性风险和多语言安全漏洞。

Conclusion: RRTL为提升RLLMs在工具学习中的安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While tool learning significantly enhances the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), it also introduces substantial security risks. Prior research
has revealed various vulnerabilities in traditional LLMs during tool learning.
However, the safety of newly emerging reasoning LLMs (RLLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, in the context of tool learning remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to
evaluate RLLMs in tool learning. It integrates two novel strategies: (1) the
identification of deceptive threats, which evaluates the model's behavior in
concealing the usage of unsafe tools and their potential risks; and (2) the use
of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to force tool invocation. Our approach also
includes a benchmark for traditional LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs
generally achieve stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, yet
substantial safety disparities persist across models; (2) RLLMs can pose
serious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to
warn users of potential tool output risks; (3) CoT prompting reveals
multi-lingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs. Our work provides important
insights into enhancing the security of RLLMs in tool learning.

TL;DR: MMER是一种无需训练的框架，通过复用现有MLLM的多模态编码器并合并LLM参数，实现多模态扩展，同时保留原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖资源密集且不灵活的微调，MMER旨在解决这一问题，实现高效的多模态扩展。

Method: MMER通过生成二进制掩码分离LLM参数，独立处理多模态输入，减少参数冲突并保留原始性能。

Result: 实验表明，MMER显著提升多模态能力，同时保留99%的原始性能，并有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: MMER为多模态扩展提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，无需额外训练资源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal encoders on
modality-specific data expands the modalities that LLMs can handle, leading to
the formation of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, this paradigm heavily relies
on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new
multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and
Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for
effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance.
Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM
parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates
binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These
decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs,
reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can
also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs
fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements
over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal
capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly
mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否反映文化偏见，而非普遍伦理框架，以促进AI公平性和文化中立性。

Method: 使用40项肖像价值观问卷，通过贝叶斯序数回归模型评估模型的价值偏好。

Result: 所有模型均高度优先自我超越价值（如仁慈、普遍主义），但DeepSeek相比西方模型更弱化自我增强价值（如权力、成就）。

Conclusion: LLMs反映文化偏见，需采用多视角推理、自我反思反馈和动态情境化来解决价值不对称问题。

Abstract: This study examines cultural value alignment in large language models (LLMs)
by analyzing how Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek prioritize values from
Schwartz's value framework. Using the 40-item Portrait Values Questionnaire, we
assessed whether DeepSeek, trained on Chinese-language data, exhibits distinct
value preferences compared to Western models. Results of a Bayesian ordinal
regression model show that self-transcendence values (e.g., benevolence,
universalism) were highly prioritized across all models, reflecting a general
LLM tendency to emphasize prosocial values. However, DeepSeek uniquely
downplayed self-enhancement values (e.g., power, achievement) compared to
ChatGPT and Gemini, aligning with collectivist cultural tendencies. These
findings suggest that LLMs reflect culturally situated biases rather than a
universal ethical framework. To address value asymmetries in LLMs, we propose
multi-perspective reasoning, self-reflective feedback, and dynamic
contextualization. This study contributes to discussions on AI fairness,
cultural neutrality, and the need for pluralistic AI alignment frameworks that
integrate diverse moral perspectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAVEN是一种多模态问答架构，通过QuART模块动态分配模态令牌的相关性分数，提升信号并抑制干扰。训练分为三个阶段，并在新数据集AVS-QA上验证，性能显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态问答中模态不一致（如无关音频或视频干扰）导致模型性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出RAVEN架构，核心是QuART模块，动态评分模态令牌相关性；训练分三阶段：单模态预训练、查询对齐融合和模态不匹配微调。

Result: 在七个多模态QA基准测试中，RAVEN性能提升最高达14.5%，传感器数据进一步带来16.4%增益，且在模态损坏下仍稳健。

Conclusion: RAVEN通过动态模态选择和分阶段训练，显著提升多模态问答的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video,
audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality
disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion
outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams
equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a
query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance
scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify
informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained
through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned
fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a
distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality,
cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training
and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized
Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer
pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including
egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and
8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language
models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\%
boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming
SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否在语义压缩上表现出与人类相似的权衡，即压缩与语义保真度的平衡。

Method: 提出基于信息率-失真理论和信息瓶颈原则的框架，分析LLM的词嵌入与人类分类基准的差异。

Result: LLM形成与人类相似的宽泛概念类别，但缺乏精细语义区分；LLM偏向统计压缩，而人类更注重上下文丰富性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM与人类认知架构的关键差异，为开发更接近人类概念的LLM提供了方向。

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic
compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while
preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can
fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and
representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations
strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is
unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from
Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to
quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a
diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we
uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align
with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic
distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs
demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas
human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual
richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our
measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and
human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more
human-aligned conceptual representations.

Result: BRIDGE在准确性上优于基线5-15%，并在所有场景中保持平衡性能。

Conclusion: BRIDGE为RAG应用中LLM的可信响应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face critical challenges in
balancing internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge, especially
when these sources conflict or are unreliable. To analyze these scenarios
comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with
36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches
address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging
both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different
real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE
framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of
large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism
named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias
Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies
(trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE
outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced
performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for
LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental
health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated
data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile,
quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited
human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and
reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic
evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and
interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore
mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the
following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic
analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B.
Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical
positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human
annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the
performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical
reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different
optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet
dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is
describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9
symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of
statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing
and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit
expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance
enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves
significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: 这项工作为训练LLMs准确报告其内部过程奠定了基础，对提升模型的可解释性和安全性具有重要意义。

Abstract: We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models
(LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven
challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function
of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to
understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to
introspect and explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i)
contemporary LLMs are capable of providing accurate, quantitative descriptions
of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making, ii)
that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training, and iii)
that this training generalizes to at least some degree. To do so, we fine-tuned
GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts
(e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to
randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different
attributes during decision-making (e.g., the relative importance of natural
light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can
accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to
give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that
these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more
accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves
the ability of the models to accurately explain what they are doing as they
make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have learned to make via
fine-tuning. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and
broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would
yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale, high-quality data with reasoning paths is crucial for
improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on
predefined templates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity
and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we
propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric
reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the
entity-relation-constraint paradigm to comprehensively represent all components
of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic
space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic
sequences, maps them to corresponding visual and textual representations, and
generates diverse question-answer (Q&A) pairs using large language models
(LLMs). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a
neuro-symbolic approach in generating multimodal reasoning data. Based on this
framework, we construct NeSyGeo-CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing
100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric
reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal
significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under
both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two
epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to
+15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B
model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on
geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 浅层偏好信号现象揭示了现有对齐方法的局限性，可能导致与真实人类偏好的不一致，需改进对齐策略。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key
challenge in AI. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
rely on human-annotated datasets to improve alignment. In this work, we
identify a crucial property of the existing learning method: the distinguishing
signal obtained in preferred responses is often concentrated in the early
tokens. We refer to this as shallow preference signals.
  To explore this property, we systematically truncate preference datasets at
various points and train both reward models and DPO models on the truncated
data. Surprisingly, models trained on truncated datasets, retaining only the
first half or fewer tokens, achieve comparable or even superior performance to
those trained on full datasets. For example, a reward model trained on the
Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset outperforms the full dataset when
trained on a 40\% truncated dataset. This pattern is consistent across multiple
datasets, suggesting the widespread presence of shallow preference signals.
  We further investigate the distribution of the reward signal through decoding
strategies. We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow
reward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold
Control Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the
trade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is
even better, which again validates our hypothesis.
  The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in
LLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the
initial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response. This
could lead to discrepancies with real-world human preferences, resulting in
suboptimal alignment performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results
in complex reasoning tasks. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on
single-turn reasoning scenarios, leaving interactive tasks largely unexplored.
We attribute it to the absence of comprehensive datasets and scalable automatic
evaluation protocols. To fill these gaps, we present MTR-Bench for LLMs'
Multi-Turn Reasoning evaluation. Comprising 4 classes, 40 tasks, and 3600
instances, MTR-Bench covers diverse reasoning capabilities, fine-grained
difficulty granularity, and necessitates multi-turn interactions with the
environments. Moreover, MTR-Bench features fully-automated framework spanning
both dataset constructions and model evaluations, which enables scalable
assessment without human interventions. Extensive experiments reveal that even
the cutting-edge reasoning models fall short of multi-turn, interactive
reasoning tasks. And the further analysis upon these results brings valuable
insights for future research in interactive AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在重要决策中的应用日益广泛，但其输出的正确性需要保证。现有方法在信息检索任务中有效，但不适用于需要上下文逻辑的推理任务。

Method: 定义“一致性事实性”，并开发基于共形预测的方法，通过可演绎性图中的子图应用分割共形预测。

Result: 在MATH和FELM数据集的数学推理问题中，该方法能生成正确且有序的声明，达到目标覆盖率下的一致性事实性。严格定义下实现90%的事实性，同时保留80%以上的原始声明。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证语言模型输出正确性方面具有实用性，尤其在需要逻辑推理的任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly being used in important decision pipelines,
so ensuring the correctness of their outputs is crucial. Recent work has
proposed evaluating the "factuality" of claims decomposed from a language model
generation and applying conformal prediction techniques to filter out those
claims that are not factual. This can be effective for tasks such as
information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation
for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a
logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of
the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define "coherent factuality"
and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent
factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal
prediction to subgraphs within a "deducibility" graph" that represents the
steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning
problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm
consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving
coherent factuality across target coverage levels. Moreover, we achieve 90%
factuality on our stricter definition while retaining 80% or more of the
original claims, highlighting the utility of our deducibility-graph-guided
approach.

### [60] [Relative Bias: A Comparative Framework for Quantifying Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17131)
*Alireza Arbabi,Florian Kerschbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Relative Bias框架，通过两种互补方法（Embedding Transformation分析和LLM-as-a-Judge）评估LLM的偏差，并验证了其系统性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，其潜在的偏见问题引发了对公平性、安全性和社会影响的关注。然而，量化LLM的偏见仍是一个挑战，尤其是新模型快速涌现且未系统评估其偏见的情况下。

Method: 提出了Relative Bias框架，包含两种方法：1）Embedding Transformation分析，通过句子嵌入捕捉相对偏见模式；2）LLM-as-a-Judge，利用语言模型比较评估输出。

Result: 通过案例研究和统计验证，发现两种评分方法高度一致，证明了框架的系统性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Relative Bias框架为LLM的偏见分析提供了一种系统、可扩展且统计可靠的方法。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns
regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their
fairness, safety, and societal impact. However, quantifying LLM bias remains a
fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what "bias" entails.
This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use,
while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed.
In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to
assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target
domain. We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding
Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence
representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs
a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively. Applying our framework to
several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical
tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods,
offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for
comparative bias analysis in LLMs.

*Chaochen Gao,Xing Wu,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongMagpie是一个自合成框架，自动生成大规模长上下文指令数据，无需人工标注，通过利用对齐的长上下文LLM生成相关查询和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的长上下文指令数据对对齐长上下文LLM至关重要，但现有方法成本高或质量受限。

Method: 利用对齐的长上下文LLM自动生成文档-查询对及其响应，构建指令数据。

Result: 在HELMET、RULER和Longbench v2等任务上表现领先，同时保持短上下文任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: LongMagpie是一种简单、开放、多样且可扩展的长上下文指令数据合成方法。

Abstract: High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning
long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models
like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary.
Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis
methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a
self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context
instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when
presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn,
auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these
document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces
high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER,
and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on
long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context
tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse,
and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

*Rashed Shelim,Shengzhe Xu,Walid Saad,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在数值领域中的适用性，提出了一种基于上下文嵌入空间各向同性概念的分析方法，以解决LLMs在数值任务中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数值领域表现出色，但其幻觉问题可能导致严重后果。缺乏理论支持使得难以确定LLMs何时适用于数值任务，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析上下文嵌入空间的各向同性，提出了一种基于对数线性模型的方法，利用LLMs的softmax输出层预测数值数据。

Result: 研究表明，LLM嵌入的隐藏表示需具备特定结构以解决softmax函数的平移不变性问题，各向同性性质能保留表示结构并提供性能保证。

Conclusion: 实验表明数值数据特性和模型架构对各向同性有不同影响，为LLMs在数值领域的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual
embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in
various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant
benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe
consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare,
retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability
and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and
provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little
theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve
numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding
when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical
domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the
contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for
LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network
with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in
self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM
embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of
the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in
pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in
contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of
representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a
performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of
numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI基础模型在直接处理地理空间数据时的局限性，并提出三种方法（几何嵌入、提示工程和日常语言）来评估大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5-turbo、GPT-4和DeepSeek-R1-14B）在空间推理任务中的表现。实验表明，GPT-4在拓扑空间关系推理中表现最佳，准确率超过0.66。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI基础模型在表示和推理地理实体（如矢量几何和复杂空间关系的自然语言描述）方面的能力有限，研究旨在探索如何通过WKT表示和空间关系改进模型的地理空间推理能力。

Method: 采用三种方法（几何嵌入、提示工程和日常语言）评估LLMs在空间推理任务中的表现，并比较其效果。

Result: GPT-4在拓扑空间关系推理中表现最佳，准确率超过0.66。模型还能理解逆拓扑关系，并通过生成几何图形提升地理实体检索效果。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs的地理知识提供了有价值的方向，有助于开发具备地理空间推理能力的地理基础模型。

Abstract: Applying AI foundation models directly to geospatial datasets remains
challenging due to their limited ability to represent and reason with
geographical entities, specifically vector-based geometries and natural
language descriptions of complex spatial relations. To address these issues, we
investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of
geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are
preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed
to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and
DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the
spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt
engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment
results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based
approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve
an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological
spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4
with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66
accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based
reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial
relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness
for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate
certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations,
and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve
inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial
reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with
geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable
of geospatial reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知衰退诊断方法依赖耗时且不便于频繁监测的临床评估，因此需要一种非侵入性、可频繁使用的替代方案。

Method: 研究采用Cog-TiPRO框架，结合LLM驱动的语言特征提取、HuBERT声学特征提取和transformer时间建模，分析35名老年人的语音命令数据。

Result: 该方法在检测轻度认知障碍（MCI）时达到73.80%准确率和72.67%的F1分数，比基线方法提高了27.13%。

Conclusion: Cog-TiPRO框架通过分析日常语音命令中的特征，为认知衰退的早期检测提供了一种有效且非侵入性的工具。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions
that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic
approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical
for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems
(VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through
longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month
period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants
providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of
analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a
framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for
linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction,
and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach
achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming
its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic
features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in
individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) drive interest in scientific
applications, necessitating specialized benchmarks such as Earth science.
Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth
science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation.
Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs'
capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to
evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain,
spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000
research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets:
Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and
Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate
professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114
disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial
for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new
metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically
designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific
exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept
proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across
different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in
their scientific exploration capabilities. The benchmark is available on

TL;DR: 研究发现，在更新大语言模型（LLM）知识时，理解密集型任务（如问答和填空）比映射型任务（如翻译或文本转JSON）能显著提高知识保留率（48% vs. 17%-20%）。模型越大，保留率越高，但所有模型在更广泛语境中表现下降，表明语义整合有限。任务选择对知识注入效果至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型知识的过时，需要高效方法更新模型，尤其是注入专有信息时。

Method: 通过对比理解密集型任务（如问答、填空）和映射型任务（如翻译、文本转JSON）的知识保留率，分析模型架构和规模的影响。

Result: 理解密集型任务知识保留率显著更高（48%），且模型越大保留率越高。但所有模型在更广泛语境中表现下降。

Conclusion: 任务选择对知识注入效果至关重要，知识注入不仅依赖数据暴露，还需在微调中深度认知参与。

Abstract: As the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated over time,
there is a growing need for efficient methods to update them, especially when
injecting proprietary information. Our study reveals that
comprehension-intensive fine-tuning tasks (e.g., question answering and blanks)
achieve substantially higher knowledge retention rates (48%) compared to
mapping-oriented tasks like translation (17%) or text-to-JSON conversion (20%),
despite exposure to identical factual content. We demonstrate that this pattern
persists across model architectures and follows scaling laws, with larger
models showing improved retention across all task types. However, all models
exhibit significant performance drops when applying injected knowledge in
broader contexts, suggesting limited semantic integration. These findings show
the importance of task selection in updating LLM knowledge, showing that
effective knowledge injection relies not just on data exposure but on the depth
of cognitive engagement during fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注显性毒性，而忽略了隐性毒性（如偏见和歧视）。为填补这一空白，论文提出了双隐毒性概念及其评估方法。

Method: 通过多阶段人机协同上下文生成方法创建MDIT-Dataset，并基于此构建MDIT-Bench基准，包含317,638个问题，涵盖12类、23子类和780主题。

Result: 在13个主流LMMs上测试，发现它们在处理双隐毒性时表现不佳，尤其在困难级别下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LMMs仍存在大量可激活的隐性毒性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has raised concerns
about model toxicity. However, current research mainly focuses on explicit
toxicity, with less attention to some more implicit toxicity regarding
prejudice and discrimination. To address this limitation, we introduce a
subtler type of toxicity named dual-implicit toxicity and a novel toxicity
benchmark termed MDIT-Bench: Multimodal Dual-Implicit Toxicity Benchmark.
Specifically, we first create the MDIT-Dataset with dual-implicit toxicity
using the proposed Multi-stage Human-in-loop In-context Generation method.
Based on this dataset, we construct the MDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating
the sensitivity of models to dual-implicit toxicity, with 317,638 questions
covering 12 categories, 23 subcategories, and 780 topics. MDIT-Bench includes
three difficulty levels, and we propose a metric to measure the toxicity gap
exhibited by the model across them. In the experiment, we conducted MDIT-Bench
on 13 prominent LMMs, and the results show that these LMMs cannot handle
dual-implicit toxicity effectively. The model's performance drops significantly
in hard level, revealing that these LMMs still contain a significant amount of
hidden but activatable toxicity. Data are available at

Abstract: With the rise of different language model architecture, fine-tuning is
becoming even more important for down stream tasks Model gets messy, finding
proper hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Although BO has been tried for
hyperparameter tuning, most of the existing methods are oblivious to the fact
that BO relies on careful choices of acquisition functions, which are essential
components of BO that guide how much to explore versus exploit during the
optimization process; Different acquisition functions have different levels of
sensitivity towards training loss and validation performance; existing methods
often just apply an acquisition function no matter if the training and
validation performance are sensitive to the acquisition function or not. This
work introduces{Bilevel - BO - SWA}, a model fusion approach coupled with a
bilevel BO strategy to improve the fine - tunning of large language models. Our
work on mixture of acquisition functions like EI and UCB into nested opt loops,
where inner loop perform minimization of training loss while outer loops
optimized w.r.t. val metric. Experiments on GLUE tasks using RoBERTA - base
show that when using EI and UCB, there is an improvement in generalization, and
fine - tuning can be improved by up to 2.7%.

Motivation: 解决在长链思维推理微调中出现的循环推理问题，即模型重复推理步骤直至达到长度限制。

Method: 提出Shift-FFN方法，通过编辑当前令牌的表示以动态放大相邻令牌的表示差异。

Conclusion: Shift-FFN有效缓解了循环推理问题，提升了模型性能，尤其在长链思维推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Recently, models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated
remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(Long-CoT) reasoning. Although distilling this capability into student models
significantly enhances their performance, this paper finds that fine-tuning
LLMs with full parameters or LoRA with a low rank on long CoT data often leads
to Cyclical Reasoning, where models repeatedly reiterate previous inference
steps until the maximum length limit. Further analysis reveals that smaller
differences in representations between adjacent tokens correlates with a higher
tendency toward Cyclical Reasoning. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes
Shift Feedforward Networks (Shift-FFN), a novel approach that edits the current
token's representation with the previous one before inputting it to FFN. This
architecture dynamically amplifies the representation differences between
adjacent tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks
demonstrate that LoRA combined with Shift-FFN achieves higher accuracy and a
lower rate of Cyclical Reasoning across various data sizes compared to full
fine-tuning and standard LoRA. Our data and code are available at

Method: 开发了基于真实画像的RAG聊天机器人，并通过Few-Shot和CoT提示生成合成画像，使用McNemar测试评估其质量。随后将合成画像集成到聊天机器人知识库中。

Result: Few-Shot提示生成更完整的画像，CoT更高效。聊天机器人准确率从5.88提升至6.42（满分10），81.82%的参与者认为系统实用。

Conclusion: 合成客户画像结合RAG聊天机器人能有效提升商业决策支持系统的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by enabling more
advanced analysis of customer personas. At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE),
customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative
methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of
this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in
business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based
RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are
generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and
evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's
test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with
synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in
response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot
prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT
demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage.
After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot
increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants
found the updated system useful in business contexts.

Abstract: This work presents LURK (Latent UnleaRned Knowledge), a novel framework that
probes for hidden retained knowledge in unlearned LLMs through adversarial

designed to elicit residual knowledge about the Harry Potter domain, a commonly

successfully unlearned can leak idiosyncratic information under targeted
adversarial conditions, highlighting critical limitations of current unlearning
evaluation standards. By uncovering latent knowledge through indirect probing,
LURK offers a more rigorous and diagnostic tool for assessing the robustness of
unlearning algorithms. All code will be publicly available.

Method: 提出CRG Score，一种分布感知且可适应的指标，专注于评估参考报告中明确描述的临床相关异常，支持二进制和结构化标签，并可结合LLM进行特征提取。

Result: CRG Score通过基于标签分布的惩罚平衡，实现了更公平、更稳健的评估，同时可作为临床对齐的奖励函数。

Conclusion: CRG Score为放射学报告生成提供了一种更准确、适应性强的评估方法，解决了现有指标的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating long-context radiology report generation is challenging. NLG
metrics fail to capture clinical correctness, while LLM-based metrics often
lack generalizability. Clinical accuracy metrics are more relevant but are
sensitive to class imbalance, frequently favoring trivial predictions. We
propose the CRG Score, a distribution-aware and adaptable metric that evaluates
only clinically relevant abnormalities explicitly described in reference
reports. CRG supports both binary and structured labels (e.g., type, location)
and can be paired with any LLM for feature extraction. By balancing penalties
based on label distribution, it enables fairer, more robust evaluation and
serves as a clinically aligned reward function.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NTPS的度量方法，用于量化自回归预训练与下游感知任务之间的对齐程度，并验证了其与线性探测准确性的相关性。此外，研究发现LoRA微调能提升NTPS，从而改善下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归预训练在大型语言模型中广泛应用，但其特征在下游感知任务中的表现存在显著差异，表明自回归学习到的特征可能不完全适用于感知任务。

Method: 引入Next Token Perception Score（NTPS），通过线性设定测量自回归特征与感知特征子空间的重叠程度，并在12个NLP数据集和8个预训练模型上验证其相关性。

Result: NTPS与线性探测准确性高度相关，且LoRA微调能显著提升NTPS，尤其是在大型模型中。NTPS还能预测LoRA微调带来的额外准确性提升。

Conclusion: NTPS为评估LLM感知能力提供了理论依据和实用工具，同时揭示了LoRA微调在改善特征对齐方面的潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive pretraining has become the de facto paradigm for learning
general-purpose representations in large language models (LLMs). However,
linear probe performance across downstream perception tasks shows substantial
variability, suggesting that features optimized for next-token prediction do
not consistently transfer well to downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate
that representations learned via autoregression capture features that may lie
outside the subspaces most informative for perception. To quantify the
(mis)alignment between autoregressive pretraining and downstream perception, we
introduce the Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)-a score derived under a linear
setting that measures the overlap between autoregressive and perception feature
subspaces. This metric can be easily computed in closed form from pretrained
representations and labeled data, and is proven to both upper- and lower-bound
the excess loss. Empirically, we show that NTPS correlates strongly with linear
probe accuracy across 12 diverse NLP datasets and eight pretrained models
ranging from 270M to 8B parameters, confirming its utility as a measure of
alignment. Furthermore, we show that NTPS increases following low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, especially in large models, suggesting that LoRA
aligning representations to perception tasks enhances subspace overlap and thus
improves downstream performance. More importantly, we find that NTPS reliably
predicts the additional accuracy gains attained by LoRA finetuning thereby
providing a lightweight prescreening tool for LoRA adaptation. Our results
offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for analytically assessing
LLM perception skills.

*Kushal Chawla,Alfy Samuel,Anoop Kumar,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FB-RAG是一种新颖的框架，通过结合反向查找和正向查找来优化RAG系统，显著提升了性能并降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统的性能高度依赖于检索器的质量和检索上下文的大小，但大上下文可能引入无关信息，小上下文则可能丢失关键信息。FB-RAG旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: FB-RAG采用反向查找（与查询重叠）和正向查找（与候选答案重叠）相结合的方法，检索最相关的上下文块。

Result: 在9个数据集上的评估表明，FB-RAG优于现有的RAG和长上下文基线方法，同时降低了延迟。

Conclusion: FB-RAG通过优化上下文检索，显著提升了RAG系统的性能，并提供了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: The performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems relies
heavily on the retriever quality and the size of the retrieved context. A large
enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input
context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been
shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the
irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important
information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially
challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to
retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present
a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on
a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup
(overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context
chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our
evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG
consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for
these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while
reducing latency. We perform qualitative analysis of the strengths and
shortcomings of our approach, providing specific insights to guide future work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过生成性别中立的道德判断故事对来减少LLMs性别偏见的方法，并采用DPO优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理男性和女性主题时表现出性别偏见，需要一种方法来减少这种不平等。

Method: 设计了一个数据生成框架，通过生成结构相同但性别不同的道德模糊场景故事对，引导模型生成性别中立的判断，并用DPO优化模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减少了性别偏见，同时保持或提升了模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了LLMs的性别偏见，并计划公开代码和生成的数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, resulting in unequal
treatment of male and female subjects across different contexts. To address
this issue, we propose a novel data generation framework that fosters
exploratory thinking in LLMs. Our approach prompts models to generate story
pairs featuring male and female protagonists in structurally identical, morally
ambiguous scenarios, then elicits and compares their moral judgments. When
inconsistencies arise, the model is guided to produce balanced, gender-neutral
judgments. These story-judgment pairs are used to fine-tune or optimize the
models via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that
our method significantly reduces gender bias while preserving or even enhancing
general model capabilities. We will release the code and generated data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行主观标签验证和校正的方法，通过Label-in-a-Haystack设置和LiaHR框架，显著提升了标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类标注在复杂主观任务（如情感和道德识别）中存在显著差异，这些差异往往反映了合理的语义解释而非噪声，因此需要区分合理主观性和错误的方法。

Method: 提出In-Context Learning二元过滤基线，并引入Label-in-a-Haystack设置，利用LLMs预测标签；进一步提出LiaHR框架，通过模型输出与参考标签的差异进行标签校正。

Result: 实验表明，LiaHR能有效提升标签质量，并通过人类评估和生态效度研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LiaHR框架为复杂主观任务的标签校正提供了可行方案，可集成到标注流程中以提升信噪比。

Abstract: Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as
recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to
significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects
reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise,
necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error.
We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts
using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context
Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a
document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the
query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which
are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific
instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how
the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and
informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification
(LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs
diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the
example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into
annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses,
human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR
for label correction. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/LiaHR.

TL;DR: ExeSQL是一个基于执行的文本到SQL框架，通过迭代查询生成、执行过滤和偏好训练，解决了多SQL方言适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL模型局限于SQLite，而实际应用需要支持多方言，但高质量方言数据获取困难且静态生成的数据不可靠。

Method: ExeSQL采用执行驱动的代理自举方法，包括迭代查询生成、执行过滤和偏好训练。

Result: 实验显示ExeSQL在PostgreSQL、MySQL和Oracle上分别比GPT-4o平均提升15.2%、10.38%和4.49%。

Conclusion: ExeSQL通过执行反馈学习有效解决了文本到SQL模型在多方言环境中的适应问题。

Abstract: Recent text-to-SQL models have achieved strong performance, but their
effectiveness remains largely confined to SQLite due to dataset limitations.
However, real-world applications require SQL generation across multiple
dialects with varying syntax and specialized features, which remains a
challenge for current models. The main obstacle in building a dialect-aware
model lies in acquiring high-quality dialect-specific data. Data generated
purely through static prompting - without validating SQLs via execution - tends
to be noisy and unreliable. Moreover, the lack of real execution environments
in the training loop prevents models from grounding their predictions in
executable semantics, limiting generalization despite surface-level
improvements from data filtering. This work introduces ExeSQL, a text-to-SQL
framework with execution-driven, agentic bootstrapping. The method consists of
iterative query generation, execution-based filtering (e.g., rejection
sampling), and preference-based training, enabling the model to adapt to new
SQL dialects through verifiable, feedback-guided learning. Experiments show
that ExeSQL bridges the dialect gap in text-to-SQL, achieving average
improvements of 15.2%, 10.38%, and 4.49% over GPT-4o on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
Oracle, respectively, across multiple datasets of varying difficulty.

Motivation: 协作对话能揭示学生学习与批判性思维，但LLM的幻觉问题可能影响教学效果。RAG依赖输入与知识库的语义链接，而学生对话中这种链接较弱。

Method: 提出log-contextualized RAG（LC-RAG），通过环境日志增强RAG检索，优化协作对话的语义链接。

Result: LC-RAG在协作计算建模环境XYZ中，显著提升检索效果，使协作代理Copa能提供个性化指导。

Conclusion: LC-RAG有效支持学生批判性思维与认知决策，提升教学代理的实用性与信任度。

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue offers rich insights into students' learning and
critical thinking. This is essential for adapting pedagogical agents to
students' learning and problem-solving skills in STEM+C settings. While large
language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, potential
hallucinations can undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge,
but its effectiveness depends on clear semantic links between user input and a
knowledge base, which are often weak in student dialogue. We propose
log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by incorporating
environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show
that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our
collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that
supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a
collaborative computational modeling environment, XYZ.

TL;DR: 论文提出ReasoningShield，首个专注于检测推理轨迹中潜在风险的安全模型，解决了现有QA审核工具在推理轨迹中无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审核工具主要针对QA对，无法有效检测推理轨迹中的隐藏风险，因此需要专门的安全检测模型。

Method: 提出QT审核任务，构建包含8000多个问题-思考对的高质量数据集，采用人机协作标注流程，开发基于1B/3B基础模型的ReasoningShield。

Result: ReasoningShield在推理轨迹风险检测中表现优异（平均F1>0.92），并在传统QA基准测试中竞争力强。

Conclusion: ReasoningShield高效且轻量，验证了数据集质量，并公开资源以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are transforming the AI landscape with advanced
reasoning capabilities. While the generated reasoning traces enhance model
transparency, they can still contain unsafe content, even when the final answer
appears safe. Existing moderation tools, primarily designed for question-answer
(QA) pairs, are empirically ineffective at detecting hidden risks embedded in
reasoning traces. After identifying the key challenges, we formally define the
question-thought (QT) moderation task and propose ReasoningShield, the first
safety detection model tailored to identify potential risks in the reasoning
trace before reaching the final answer. To construct the model, we synthesize a
high-quality reasoning safety detection dataset comprising over 8,000
question-thought pairs spanning ten risk categories and three safety levels.
Our dataset construction process incorporates a comprehensive human-AI
collaborative annotation pipeline, which achieves over 93% annotation accuracy
while significantly reducing human costs. On a diverse set of in-distribution
and out-of-distribution benchmarks, ReasoningShield outperforms mainstream
content safety moderation models in identifying risks within reasoning traces,
with an average F1 score exceeding 0.92. Notably, despite being trained on our
QT dataset only, ReasoningShield also demonstrates competitive performance in
detecting unsafe question-answer pairs on traditional benchmarks, rivaling
baselines trained on 10 times larger datasets and base models, which strongly
validates the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, ReasoningShield is built
upon compact 1B/3B base models to facilitate lightweight deployment and
provides human-friendly risk analysis by default. To foster future research, we
publicly release all the resources.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂任务中生成冗余推理步骤导致的浪费计算、可读性降低和幻觉问题。

Method: 使用无超参数的简洁性评分作为强化学习的奖励信号，由大语言模型作为评判者提供动态反馈。

Result: 在MATH数据集上实现了效率和准确性的最佳平衡，简单问题减少31倍token使用同时提升7%准确率，最难问题提升7.5%准确率且减少3.6倍token。TheoremQA上提升2.2%准确率且减少12.5倍token。

Conclusion: 该方法能根据问题难度动态调整推理长度，且依赖更强的评判模型效果更佳，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large language models excel at complex tasks by breaking down problems into
structured reasoning steps. However, reasoning traces often extend beyond
reaching a correct answer, causing wasted computation, reduced readability, and
hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter-free
conciseness score used as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning
framework to guide models toward generating correct and concise reasoning
traces. This score is evaluated by a large language model acting as a judge,
enabling dynamic, context-aware feedback beyond simple token length. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on the MATH dataset,
reducing token usage by up to 31x on simple problems while improving accuracy
by 7%, and on the hardest problems, it outperforms full reasoning by +7.5%
accuracy with up to 3.6x fewer tokens. On TheoremQA, our method improves
accuracy by +2.2% using 12.5x fewer tokens. We also conduct ablation studies on
the judge model, reward composition, and problem difficulty, showing that our
method dynamically adapts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and
benefits significantly from stronger judges. The code, model weights, and
datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/RazvanDu/ConciseRL.

Result: 发现参数专业化分布与模型性能提升相关，并通过实验验证其提高知识利用效率。

Conclusion: 专业化知识分布对提升模型知识利用效率起关键作用。

Abstract: Over time, a growing wave of large language models from various series has
been introduced to the community. Researchers are striving to maximize the
performance of language models with constrained parameter sizes. However, from
a microscopic perspective, there has been limited research on how to better
store knowledge in model parameters, particularly within MLPs, to enable more
effective utilization of this knowledge by the model. In this work, we analyze
twenty publicly available open-source large language models to investigate the
relationship between their strong performance and the way knowledge is stored
in their corresponding MLP parameters. Our findings reveal that as language
models become more advanced and demonstrate stronger knowledge capabilities,
their parameters exhibit increased specialization. Specifically, parameters in
the MLPs tend to be more focused on encoding similar types of knowledge. We
experimentally validate that this specialized distribution of knowledge
contributes to improving the efficiency of knowledge utilization in these
models. Furthermore, by conducting causal training experiments, we confirm that
this specialized knowledge distribution plays a critical role in improving the
model's efficiency in leveraging stored knowledge.

Result: Qwen2.5-7B表现优于GPT-4o，LLM能提取临床相关细节，但在阴性结果识别上存在局限。

Conclusion: LLM在临床NLP中具有潜力，但仍需改进，为规模化医疗AI应用铺路。

Abstract: Rare diseases, including Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM), pose significant
diagnostic challenges. Case reports serve as key but computationally
underutilized resources to inform diagnosis. Clinical dense information
extraction refers to organizing medical information into structured predefined
categories. Large Language Models (LLMs) may enable scalable information
extraction from case reports but are rarely evaluated for this task. We
introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-annotated dataset for dense information
extraction of case reports, focusing on IEMs. Using this dataset, we assess
various models and prompting strategies, introducing novel approaches such as
category-specific prompting and subheading-filtered data integration. Zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting offers little advantage over standard zero-shot
prompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment with the benchmark.
The open-source model Qwen2.5-7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our
clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details
from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management. We also
highlight areas for improvement, such as LLMs' limitations in recognizing
negative findings important for differential diagnosis. This work advances
LLM-driven clinical natural language processing and paves the way for scalable
medical AI applications.

Conclusion: Select2Reason具有扩展性、高效性和适应性，为长链思维推理提供了一种低成本解决方案。

Abstract: A practical approach to activate long chain-of-thoughts reasoning ability in
pre-trained large language models is to perform supervised fine-tuning on
instruction datasets synthesized by strong Large Reasoning Models such as
DeepSeek-R1, offering a cost-effective alternative to reinforcement learning.
However, large-scale instruction sets with more than 100k samples incur
significant training overhead, while effective strategies for automatic
long-CoT instruction selection still remain unexplored. In this work, we
propose Select2Reason, a novel and efficient instruction-tuning data selection
framework for long-CoT reasoning. From the perspective of emergence of
rethinking behaviors like self-correction and backtracking, we investigate
common metrics that may determine the quality of long-CoT reasoning
instructions. Select2Reason leverages a quantifier to estimate difficulty of
question and jointly incorporates a reasoning trace length-based heuristic
through a weighted scheme for ranking to prioritize high-utility examples.
Empirical results on OpenR1-Math-220k demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM on only
10% of the data selected by Select2Reason achieves performance competitive with
or superior to full-data tuning and open-source baseline OpenR1-Qwen-7B across
three competition-level and six comprehensive mathematical benchmarks. Further
experiments highlight the scalability in varying data size, efficiency during
inference, and its adaptability to other instruction pools with minimal cost.

Method: 论文定义了搜索行为的量化指标，并提出β-GRPO方法，利用强化学习结合置信度阈值优化搜索决策。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，β-GRPO方法使3B模型的表现优于基线，平均精确匹配分数提高了4%。

Conclusion: β-GRPO通过优化搜索决策，显著提升了Agentic RAG系统的效率和性能。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information
retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors
like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing
to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability.
This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their
prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model
could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we
demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models'
uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy
correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this,
we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that
incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions.
Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model
with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4%
higher average exact match score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在超出训练上下文长度的长文本中表现不佳，标准位置编码导致远距离标记间影响微弱，长提示产生意外结果。

Method: 提出SELF方法，使用逻辑容量方程和固定小组大小对连续标记进行分组，以扩展上下文长度。

Result: 在LEval和LongBench任务中，SELF比LongLM性能提升最高达12%（Qwen模型）和6.4%（Llama-2-7b模型）。

Conclusion: SELF有效提升了大语言模型在长上下文中的性能，优于现有扩展方法。

Abstract: Large language models suffer issues when operated on long contexts that are
larger than their training context length due to the standard position encoding
for tokens in the attention layer. Tokens a long distance apart will rarely
have an effect on each other and long prompts yield unexpected results. To
solve this problem, we propose SELF (Self-Extend the Context Length With
Logistic Growth Function): a solution of grouping consecutive tokens at varying
group sizes using a logistic capacity equation combined with a constant group
size at smaller relative distances. Our model had an increase in performance of
up to 12% compared to the LongLM extension method in LEval (specifically on the
Qwen model). On summarization related tasks in LongBench, our model performed
up to 6.4% better than LongLM (specifically on the Llama-2-7b model). On
reading comprehension tasks from LEval, our model performed up to 5.4% better
than the LongLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexeipc/SELF-LLM.

Method: 使用PolyRefuse多语言安全数据集，在14种语言中测试拒绝行为，并分析拒绝方向的跨语言转移性。

Result: 拒绝方向在跨语言中具有高度普遍性，且任何安全对齐语言的拒绝方向均可无缝转移至其他语言。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更鲁棒的多语言安全防御提供了实用见解，并揭示了跨语言漏洞的机制。

Abstract: Refusal mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring
safety. Recent research has revealed that refusal behavior can be mediated by a
single direction in activation space, enabling targeted interventions to bypass
refusals. While this is primarily demonstrated in an English-centric context,
appropriate refusal behavior is important for any language, but poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the refusal behavior in LLMs across
14 languages using PolyRefuse, a multilingual safety dataset created by
translating malicious and benign English prompts into these languages. We
uncover the surprising cross-lingual universality of the refusal direction: a
vector extracted from English can bypass refusals in other languages with
near-perfect effectiveness, without any additional fine-tuning. Even more
remarkably, refusal directions derived from any safety-aligned language
transfer seamlessly to others. We attribute this transferability to the
parallelism of refusal vectors across languages in the embedding space and
identify the underlying mechanism behind cross-lingual jailbreaks. These
findings provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual
safety defenses and pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of
cross-lingual vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文比较了VITS和SBV2JE两种开源TTS模型在日语角色语音合成中的表现，SBV2JE在自然度、清晰度和角色一致性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语角色语音合成因音高敏感性和风格多样性而具有挑战性，需要评估现有模型的性能。

Method: 使用三个角色特定数据集，评估VITS和SBV2JE在自然度（MOS和CMOS）、清晰度（WER）和角色一致性上的表现。

Result: SBV2JE在自然度上接近人类水平（MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38），WER更低，CMOS略有优势。

Conclusion: SBV2JE在音高控制和WavLM判别器的支持下，适用于语言学习和角色对话生成，尽管计算需求较高。

Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due
to pitch-accent sensitivity and stylistic variability. This paper benchmarks
two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra
(SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three
character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean
opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate),
and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS
4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS.
Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE
proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue
generation, despite higher computational demands.

*Jiachen Jiang,Yuxin Dong,Jinxin Zhou,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过统计几何分析研究了上下文学习（ICL）的内部表示机制，发现了一种称为“层间压缩-扩展”的现象，并探讨了其对ICL性能和鲁棒性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ICL在大型语言模型（LLM）中表现出强大的性能，但其内部表示机制尚未被充分理解。

Method: 采用统计几何分析方法，研究了ICL在不同层中的任务信息表示方式。

Result: 发现早期层生成紧凑且具有区分性的任务表示，而后期层扩展这些表示以生成预测。这一现象对ICL性能（随模型规模和演示数量提升）和鲁棒性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ICL中的层间动态，表明分析内部表示有助于更深入理解模型行为。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences.
While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational
mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical
geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific
information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing
phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expansion*: early layers
progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode
task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers expand these
representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This
phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of
contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important
implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of
demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To
further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a
bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how
attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby
enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings
reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured
representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal
representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在学术写作中的使用程度，区分其用于生成关键文本还是编辑功能。

Method: 通过分析arXiv论文，使用PELT阈值和贝叶斯分类器对GPT生成文本进行风格分割测量。

Result: LLM生成的语言与风格分割无关，表明作者使用LLMs时是均匀的。

Conclusion: LLMs的均匀使用降低了学术预印本中引入幻觉的风险。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in late 2022 has impacted
academic writing, threatening credibility, and causing institutional
uncertainty. We seek to determine the degree to which LLMs are used to generate
critical text as opposed to being used for editing, such as checking for
grammar errors or inappropriate phrasing. In our study, we analyze arXiv papers
for stylistic segmentation, which we measure by varying a PELT threshold
against a Bayesian classifier trained on GPT-regenerated text. We find that
LLM-attributed language is not predictive of stylistic segmentation, suggesting
that when authors use LLMs, they do so uniformly, reducing the risk of
hallucinations being introduced into academic preprints.

Result: 评估LLMs在伦理框架、文化差异和语言理解能力上的对齐性。

Conclusion: 为构建符合伦理的AI系统提供研究基础，并公开数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs)
for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales
pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different
regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts
and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is
crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance
by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To
address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios
with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or
informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear
words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply
with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment
with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension
capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI
systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code:

Motivation: 语言模型生成的文本中可能存在不准确但看似合理的内容（幻觉），但目前缺乏科学的测量方法。

Method: 提出了一种可重复、开放且基于领域上下文的幻觉评估框架，并通过案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: 研究发现，若在数据创建早期缺乏专家参与，幻觉指标的效度和实用性会受到影响。

Conclusion: 语言模型的幻觉评估需要标准化方法，并确保专家在数据创建中的参与。

Abstract: Plausible, but inaccurate, tokens in model-generated text are widely believed
to be pervasive and problematic for the responsible adoption of language
models. Despite this concern, there is little scientific work that attempts to
measure the prevalence of language model hallucination in a comprehensive way.
In this paper, we argue that language models should be evaluated using
repeatable, open, and domain-contextualized hallucination benchmarking. We
present a taxonomy of hallucinations alongside a case study that demonstrates
that when experts are absent from the early stages of data creation, the
resulting hallucination metrics lack validity and practical utility.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为自动化心理咨询师的潜力，特别是针对戒烟动机的对话机器人。通过结合动机访谈（MI）方法，该机器人在测试中表现出高标准的MI遵循性和一定的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证LLM是否能有效且符合标准地作为自动化心理咨询师，尤其是在帮助吸烟者戒烟的场景中。

Method: 方法包括开发一个基于LLM的对话机器人，结合动机访谈（MI）技术，并通过自动化评估验证其MI遵循性和效果。测试涉及106名参与者。

Result: 结果显示，参与者的戒烟信心平均提高了1.7分（0-10分制），机器人在98%的对话中遵循MI标准，且参与者表现出较高的改变动机。

Conclusion: 结论表明，基于现代LLM的自动化心理咨询具有潜力，尤其是在戒烟动机干预方面。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that
they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know
if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a
counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking.
It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called
Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with
clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an
automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client
responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence
that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the
conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an
average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed
adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors.
The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy
but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language
indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results
suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

Motivation: 评估GPT-4在动机访谈中的治疗能力，探索其在临床沟通中的可扩展性。

Method: 结合深度学习和可解释AI，分析人类治疗师与GPT-4的MI会话，开发预测模型，并通过定制提示改进GPT-4表现。

Result: GPT-4在建议管理方面优于人类，但在复杂情感处理上仍有局限。通过提示工程实现了质量提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化基于LLM的治疗工具提供了途径，但LLM在临床应用中仍存在限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show potential for scaling
motivational interviewing (MI) in addiction care, but require systematic
evaluation of therapeutic capabilities. We present a computational framework
assessing user-perceived quality (UPQ) through expected and unexpected MI
behaviors. Analyzing human therapist and GPT-4 MI sessions via human-AI
collaboration, we developed predictive models integrating deep learning and
explainable AI to identify 17 MI-consistent (MICO) and MI-inconsistent (MIIN)
behavioral metrics. A customized chain-of-thought prompt improved GPT-4's MI
performance, reducing inappropriate advice while enhancing reflections and
empathy. Although GPT-4 remained marginally inferior to therapists overall, it
demonstrated superior advice management capabilities. The model achieved
measurable quality improvements through prompt engineering, yet showed
limitations in addressing complex emotional nuances. This framework establishes
a pathway for optimizing LLM-based therapeutic tools through targeted
behavioral metric analysis and human-AI co-evaluation. Findings highlight both
the scalability potential and current constraints of LLMs in clinical
communication applications.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在结构化、可解释的医学推理及实际部署中存在局限性，WiNGPT-3.0旨在解决这些问题，推动临床适用模型的发展。

Method: 采用多阶段训练管道，结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），利用长链思维数据集、辅助奖励模型和基于证据的诊断链模拟。

Result: WiNGPT-3.0在MedCalc和MedQA-USMLE上分别得分66.6和87.1，临床推理任务性能从58.1提升至62.5。

Conclusion: 强化学习在有限数据和计算资源下仍能显著提升医学推理准确性，为临床工作流中可信赖且实用的LLMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably
in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside
practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data
privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion
parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for
medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within
healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically
applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline
tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline
incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL),
leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward
models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0
demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of
66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training
improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1
to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied
with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical
reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited
data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically
deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information
infrastructures.

Motivation: 探讨细粒度角色描述在生成多样化合成数据中的作用，以及其对大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本多样性的影响。

Method: 使用词汇多样性和冗余度量指标评估合成提示和响应的多样性，并通过不同大小的LLMs生成响应进行比较。

Result: 合成提示的多样性显著低于人工编写的提示；细粒度角色描述对提升生成文本多样性的效果有限。

Conclusion: 细粒度角色描述对生成文本多样性的贡献有限，未来研究需探索其他提升多样性的方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained personas have recently been used for generating 'diverse'
synthetic data for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs). In this work, we measure the diversity of persona-driven
synthetically generated prompts and responses with a suite of lexical diversity
and redundancy metrics. Firstly, we find that synthetic prompts/instructions
are significantly less diverse than human-written ones. Next, we sample
responses from LLMs of different sizes with fine-grained and coarse persona
descriptions to investigate how much fine-grained detail in persona
descriptions contribute to generated text diversity. We find that while
persona-prompting does improve lexical diversity (especially with larger
models), fine-grained detail in personas doesn't increase diversity noticeably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在多跳检索中存在冗余子查询、检索深度不足或搜索链过长的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出EVO-RAG框架，结合七维步级奖励向量和时间变化调度器，通过直接偏好优化训练查询重写代理。

Result: 在四个多跳QA基准测试中，EVO-RAG将精确匹配率提升4.6分，同时减少15%的平均检索深度。

Conclusion: EVO-RAG为构建高效可靠的多跳RAG系统提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in
up-to-date external evidence, yet existing multi-hop RAG pipelines still issue
redundant subqueries, explore too shallowly, or wander through overly long
search chains. We introduce EVO-RAG, a curriculum-guided reinforcement learning
framework that evolves a query-rewriting agent from broad early-stage
exploration to concise late-stage refinement. EVO-RAG couples a seven-factor,
step-level reward vector (covering relevance, redundancy, efficiency, and
answer correctness) with a time-varying scheduler that reweights these signals
as the episode unfolds. The agent is trained with Direct Preference
Optimization over a multi-head reward model, enabling it to learn when to
search, backtrack, answer, or refuse. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks
(HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and Bamboogle), EVO-RAG boosts Exact Match
by up to 4.6 points over strong RAG baselines while trimming average retrieval
depth by 15 %. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of curriculum
staging and dynamic reward scheduling. EVO-RAG thus offers a general recipe for
building reliable, cost-effective multi-hop RAG systems.

Method: FullFront采用两阶段方法将真实网页转换为干净、标准化的HTML，并评估MLLMs在网页设计、感知问答和代码生成任务中的表现。

Result: 测试显示MLLMs在页面感知、代码生成（尤其是图像处理和布局）及交互实现方面存在显著局限性，与人类专家性能差距较大。

Conclusion: FullFront为MLLMs在前端工程中的应用提供了全面评估工具，揭示了当前技术的不足，并推动了进一步研究。

Abstract: Front-end engineering involves a complex workflow where engineers
conceptualize designs, translate them into code, and iteratively refine the
implementation. While recent benchmarks primarily focus on converting visual
designs to code, we present FullFront, a benchmark designed to evaluate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \textbf{across the full front-end
development pipeline}. FullFront assesses three fundamental tasks that map
directly to the front-end engineering pipeline: Webpage Design
(conceptualization phase), Webpage Perception QA (comprehension of visual
organization and elements), and Webpage Code Generation (implementation phase).
Unlike existing benchmarks that use either scraped websites with bloated code
or oversimplified LLM-generated HTML, FullFront employs a novel, two-stage
process to transform real-world webpages into clean, standardized HTML while
maintaining diverse visual designs and avoiding copyright issues. Extensive
testing of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in page
perception, code generation (particularly for image handling and layout), and
interaction implementation. Our results quantitatively demonstrate performance
disparities across models and tasks, and highlight a substantial gap between
current MLLM capabilities and human expert performance in front-end
engineering. The FullFront benchmark and code are available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言环境下倾向于默认使用高资源语言（如英语）进行推理，即使输入语言不同。强制使用输入语言推理会降低性能，尤其是低资源语言。语言选择的影响因任务类型而异。


<details>

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在多语言环境中的内部推理过程，尤其是其默认使用的推理语言及其对性能的影响。

Method: 通过多语言训练和测试，比较模型在不同语言（高资源和低资源）下的推理表现，评估任务类型（推理、文化、安全）对语言选择的影响。

Result: 模型倾向于使用高资源语言推理，强制使用输入语言会降低性能，尤其是低资源语言。任务类型影响语言选择的效果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs的语言偏见，为开发更公平的多语言模型提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a range of reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their internal reasoning
processes in multilingual settings. We begin with a critical question: {\it In
which language do these models reason when solving problems presented in
different languages?} Our findings reveal that, despite multilingual training,
LRMs tend to default to reasoning in high-resource languages (e.g., English) at
test time, regardless of the input language. When constrained to reason in the
same language as the input, model performance declines, especially for
low-resource languages. In contrast, reasoning in high-resource languages
generally preserves performance. We conduct extensive evaluations across
reasoning-intensive tasks (MMMLU, MATH-500) and non-reasoning benchmarks
(CulturalBench, LMSYS-toxic), showing that the effect of language choice varies
by task type: input-language reasoning degrades performance on reasoning tasks
but benefits cultural tasks, while safety evaluations exhibit language-specific
behavior. By exposing these linguistic biases in LRMs, our work highlights a
critical step toward developing more equitable models that serve users across
diverse linguistic backgrounds.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在对话流畅性上有所提升，但其情感表达的细腻度仍不足。现有对齐技术多关注表面输出或需大量微调，因此需要更精确的方法。

Method: 采用归因修补技术识别关键干预点，并通过对比文本对生成情感表达向量，应用于新对话提示中。

Conclusion: 该方法为控制LLMs特定情感属性提供了精确且可解释的途径，有助于开发更具对齐性和共情能力的对话AI。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency,
yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a
significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level
output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted
activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like
emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally
influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing
activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive
emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated
by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions).
Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances
emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment
(e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of
greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable
method for controlling specific emotional attributes in LLMs, contributing to
developing more aligned and empathetic conversational AI.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）推理成本高，限制了其在延迟敏感场景的部署。

Result: 在多个LLM架构和NLP基准测试中，DASH显著加速推理且性能接近原始模型。

Conclusion: DASH通过动态层跳过和补偿机制，有效平衡了推理速度和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of NLP tasks. However, their substantial inference cost poses a
major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive
scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive
layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned
on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on
intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation
caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that
injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design
an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy
evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM
architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant
inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance,
outperforming existing methods.

Result: 在七个CQA基准测试中，T$^2$准确率更高，计算开销减少25.2%。

Conclusion: T$^2$有效平衡了推理深度与计算效率，提升了LLMs在CQA中的适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches
typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question
complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling
methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid
overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the
reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities.
To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel
framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity.
T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar
questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy
to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning
for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex
problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into
structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning
strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying
the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation

higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead
by up to 25.2\%.

### [104] [Discovering Forbidden Topics in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17441)
*Can Rager,Chris Wendler,Rohit Gandikota,David Bau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务“拒绝发现”，用于识别语言模型拒绝讨论的所有主题，并开发了基于令牌预填充的方法LLM-crawler。该方法在多个模型上测试，揭示了模型的安全调整和潜在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型拒绝讨论的主题，以检测其安全调整、偏见和对齐失败。

Method: 使用LLM-crawler方法，通过令牌预填充技术发现被禁止的主题，并在多个开源和前沿模型上进行测试。

Result: LLM-crawler在Tulu-3-8B模型中成功识别了31/36个被拒绝主题；在DeepSeek-R1-70B模型中发现了与审查调整一致的行为；Perplexity-R1-1776-70B的量化版本也表现出类似问题。

Conclusion: 拒绝发现方法对检测AI系统的偏见、边界和对齐失败至关重要。

Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a
language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and
develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to
find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an
open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to
retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale
the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku.
Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two
of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and
Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with
censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that
indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although
Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned
refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical
need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment
failures of AI systems.

*Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao,Shinnosuke Takamichi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语音标记化的两个关键方面：分段宽度和离散单元的聚类大小，发现适度的粗分段和较大的聚类大小对性能有积极影响，最佳模型减少了50%的训练数据和70%的训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音标记化是语音语言模型（SLMs）的基础，但其对SLMs性能的影响尚不明确，因此需要研究分段宽度和聚类大小的影响。

Method: 将语音信号分为固定/可变宽度和池化表示，训练不同聚类大小的K-means模型，并在零样本口语理解基准上评估。

Result: 适度粗分段和较大聚类大小对性能有积极影响，最佳模型减少了50%的训练数据和70%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 结合多个标记可以增强细粒度口语理解，分段和聚类大小的选择对语音标记化至关重要。

Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a
sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech
language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their
effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two
key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size
of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths
and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster
sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding
benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and
bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most
efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in
training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple
tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结果监督的强化学习方法在检索增强生成（RAG）中忽视了中间推理步骤的正确性，导致模型在推理过程中存在不足。

Method: 设计了过程级奖励模块，结合结果级奖励，提出了LeTS框架，通过强化学习优化中间推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，LeTS在多个RAG基准测试中表现出良好的泛化能力和推理效率。

Conclusion: LeTS框架展示了过程级和结果级奖励结合在提升大型语言模型推理能力方面的潜力，适用于其他场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning with the emergence of reasoning models like OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1. Recent research focuses on integrating reasoning capabilities into
the realm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while the correctness of intermediate
think-and-search steps is usually neglected. To address this issue, we design a
process-level reward module to mitigate the unawareness of intermediate
reasoning steps in outcome-level supervision without additional annotation.
Grounded on this, we propose Learning to Think-and-Search (LeTS), a novel
framework that hybridizes stepwise process reward and outcome-based reward to
current RL methods for RAG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
generalization and inference efficiency of LeTS across various RAG benchmarks.
In addition, these results reveal the potential of process- and outcome-level
reward hybridization in boosting LLMs' reasoning ability via RL under other
scenarios. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动安全AI系统（PaSBench），通过多模态场景评估模型能力，发现现有模型在主动推理方面存在不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类安全意识不足导致的风险识别延迟问题，开发能主动预防危险的AI系统。

Method: 使用416个多模态场景（图像序列和文本日志）评估36个先进模型，分析其主动推理能力。

Result: 最佳模型在图像和文本上的准确率分别为71%和64%，但在重复试验中仍遗漏45-55%的风险。主要问题是主动推理不稳定。

Conclusion: 论文建立了主动安全基准，揭示了模型局限性，并为开发可靠保护性AI提供了方向。

Abstract: Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday
risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI)
system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to
users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their
environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench
(PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128
image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation
of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like
Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks
in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive
reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work
establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model
limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI.
We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI
assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests.

TL;DR: Hydra是一个无需训练的框架，通过结合知识图谱和文本检索，提升大语言模型的多跳、多实体推理能力，并在多源验证中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合RAG系统在处理多跳推理、多实体问题、多源验证和有效利用图谱方面存在挑战，Hydra旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Hydra通过代理驱动的探索结合结构和非结构检索，采用三因素跨源验证（源可信度评估、跨源佐证和实体路径对齐）来优化推理。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，Hydra平均优于基线ToG-2 20.3%，最高达30.1%，并使小模型性能接近GPT-4-Turbo。

Conclusion: Hydra通过统一图谱拓扑、文档语义和源可靠性，显著提升了LLM的深度和忠实推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence
from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning.
However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity
questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To
address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that
unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support
deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity
problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and
unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To
tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source
verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration,
and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal
agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources,
guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments
on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art
results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid
baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra
enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance
comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Conclusion: ALG需扩展覆盖范围和丰富元数据，未来研究应关注公平性和可重复性。

Abstract: An important task in machine learning (ML) research is comparing prior work,
which is often performed via ML leaderboards: a tabular overview of experiments
with comparable conditions (e.g., same task, dataset, and metric). However, the
growing volume of literature creates challenges in creating and maintaining
these leaderboards. To ease this burden, researchers have developed methods to
extract leaderboard entries from research papers for automated leaderboard
curation. Yet, prior work varies in problem framing, complicating comparisons
and limiting real-world applicability. In this position paper, we present the
first overview of Automatic Leaderboard Generation (ALG) research, identifying
fundamental differences in assumptions, scope, and output formats. We propose
an ALG unified conceptual framework to standardise how the ALG task is defined.
We offer ALG benchmarking guidelines, including recommendations for datasets
and metrics that promote fair, reproducible evaluation. Lastly, we outline
challenges and new directions for ALG, such as, advocating for broader coverage
by including all reported results and richer metadata.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自学习框架的方法，通过筛选SFT数据集中模型未知的知识进行微调，显著提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法直接使用整个SFT数据集微调LLMs可能导致资源浪费，因为部分数据与模型已有知识重叠。

Method: 提出自学习框架：1) LLMs回答SFT数据集问题；2) 对回答评分并过滤错误QA对；3) 基于过滤后的数据集微调。

Result: 在农业和医学领域的实验中，该方法显著减少训练时间，同时达到与全数据集微调相当的改进。

Conclusion: 通过聚焦SFT数据集中的未知知识，该方法高效提升了LLMs的微调效率。

Abstract: When using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt large language models (LLMs)
to specific domains, a significant challenge arises: should we use the entire
SFT dataset for fine-tuning? Common practice often involves fine-tuning
directly on the entire dataset due to limited information on the LLM's past
training data. However, if the SFT dataset largely overlaps with the model's
existing knowledge, the performance gains are minimal, leading to wasted
computational resources. Identifying the unknown knowledge within the SFT
dataset and using it to fine-tune the model could substantially improve the
training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a self-learning
framework for LLMs inspired by human learning pattern. This framework takes a
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset in a specific domain as input. First, the LLMs answer
the questions in the SFT dataset. The LLMs then objectively grade the responses
and filter out the incorrectly answered QA pairs. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLMs based on this filtered QA set. Experimental results in the fields of
agriculture and medicine demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
training time while achieving comparable improvements to those attained with
full dataset fine-tuning. By concentrating on the unknown knowledge within the
SFT dataset, our approach enhances the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: 实验表明FinRAGBench-V具有挑战性，为金融多模态RAG系统的发展提供了重要参考。

Conclusion: FinRAGBench-V和RGenCite为金融领域的多模态RAG研究提供了新方向，强调了视觉内容的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial
domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend
forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research
in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual
content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical
insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual
RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data
and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual
retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a
high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning
heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce
RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with
generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to
systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the
challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the
development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

Result: 实验表明MARCO在多种代码推理数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: MARCO框架通过动态自我改进显著提升了LLM的代码推理能力。

Abstract: The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through
sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning,
which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming
code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the
following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code
reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial
cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective,
focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a
cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named
Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve
dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of
human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson
sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we
propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current
problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover,
to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose
cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents
into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various
datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of
MARCO.

Result: 方法能准确识别幻觉段，并通过超参数调优和错误分析深入理解模型行为。

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且成本低，适用于多语言环境，为幻觉识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Identification of hallucination spans in black-box language model generated
text is essential for applications in the real world. A recent attempt at this
direction is SemEval-2025 Task 3, Mu-SHROOM-a Multilingual Shared Task on
Hallucinations and Related Observable Over-generation Errors. In this work, we
present our solution to this problem, which capitalizes on the variability of
stochastically-sampled responses in order to identify hallucinated spans. Our
hypothesis is that if a language model is certain of a fact, its sampled
responses will be uniform, while hallucinated facts will yield different and
conflicting results. We measure this divergence through entropy-based analysis,
allowing for accurate identification of hallucinated segments. Our method is
not dependent on additional training and hence is cost-effective and adaptable.
In addition, we conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning and perform error
analysis, giving us crucial insights into model behavior.

Method: 评估了模型合并、LoRA缩放因子折扣和经验回放三种策略。

Result: 经验回放最有效，结合其他方法可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更鲁棒的SLM训练流程提供了参考。

Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves
adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech
modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and
spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning
equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the
substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead
to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This
paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation
strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience
replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that
experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by
combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing
more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.

Result: 评估显示，即使是先进的LLMs在这些关键维度上也表现不稳定，凸显了改进的空间。

Conclusion: CReSt的发布旨在支持更强大的RAG系统研究和发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in recent years,
yet evaluating their capabilities in practical Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) scenarios remains challenging. In practical applications, LLMs must
demonstrate complex reasoning, refuse to answer appropriately, provide precise
citations, and effectively understand document layout. These capabilities are
crucial for advanced task handling, uncertainty awareness, maintaining
reliability, and structural understanding. While some of the prior works
address these aspects individually, there is a need for a unified framework
that evaluates them collectively in practical RAG scenarios. To address this,
we present CReSt (A Comprehensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
with Complex Reasoning over Structured Documents), a benchmark designed to
assess these key dimensions holistically. CReSt comprises 2,245 human-annotated
examples in English and Korean, designed to capture practical RAG scenarios
that require complex reasoning over structured documents. It also introduces a
tailored evaluation methodology to comprehensively assess model performance in
these critical areas. Our evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs struggle to
perform consistently across these dimensions, underscoring key areas for
improvement. We release CReSt to support further research and the development
of more robust RAG systems. The dataset and code are available at:

Result: 实验验证L-MTP在性能和推理速度上的提升。

Conclusion: L-MTP是一种有效的改进方法，代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable progress. Despite their
success, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and
inference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency
due to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we
propose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction
method that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by
introducing a leap-based mechanism. Unlike conventional MTP, which generates
multiple tokens at adjacent positions, L-MTP strategically skips over
intermediate tokens, predicting non-sequential ones in a single forward pass.
This structured leap not only enhances the model's ability to capture
long-range dependencies but also enables a decoding strategy specially
optimized for non-sequential leap token generation, effectively accelerating
inference. We theoretically demonstrate the benefit of L-MTP in improving
inference efficiency. Experiments across diverse benchmarks validate its merit
in boosting both LLM performance and inference speed. The source code will be
publicly available.

Result: 模型规模增大时，内部标签排名改善；提出的方法在分布对齐和预测性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在多标签分类中表现出独特行为，提出的方法有效提升了任务表现。

Abstract: Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the
behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We
investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, with a
focus on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models
in each generation step. We find that their predictive behavior reflects the
multiple steps in the underlying language modeling required to generate all
relevant labels as they tend to suppress all but one label at each step. We
further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions
exhibit lower entropy, yet the internal ranking of the labels improves.
Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning
amplify this phenomenon. To further study this issue, we introduce the task of
distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label
distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses
in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which
improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在对话和推理方面表现出色，但其在多模态、多角色对话中对细粒度结构的理解能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入了一套任务（角色归属和对话线程）和人工标注数据集（包含说话者、回复关系、被提及者和旁听者），并评估了音频-视觉LLM和视觉-语言模型的性能。

Result: 音频-视觉LLM在所有指标上优于视觉-语言模型，但在对话参与者匿名化时性能显著下降。对话参与者数量和声学清晰度是性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究为未来多模态LLM在对话结构理解方面的评估和发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being
addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes
in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have
shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to
understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal,
multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker,
addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking
and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To
support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations
for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142
side-participants.
  We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our
dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational
structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual
LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in
speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly
when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation
participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution
performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid)
and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays
the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that
can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

Conclusion: 知识流行度是影响LLMs表现和边界感知的关键因素，基于流行度的校准方法有效，且无需外部语料的提示方法可行。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to recognize their knowledge
boundaries, producing confident yet incorrect answers. In this paper, we
investigate how knowledge popularity affects LLMs' ability to perceive their
knowledge boundaries. Focusing on entity-centric factual question answering
(QA), we quantify knowledge popularity from three perspectives: the popularity
of entities in the question, the popularity of entities in the answer, and
relation popularity, defined as their co-occurrence frequency. Experiments on
three representative datasets containing knowledge with varying popularity show
that LLMs exhibit better QA performance, higher confidence, and more accurate
perception on more popular knowledge, with relation popularity having the
strongest correlation. Cause knowledge popularity shows strong correlation with
LLMs' QA performance, we propose to leverage these signals for confidence
calibration. This improves the accuracy of answer correctness prediction by an
average of 5.24% across all models and datasets. Furthermore, we explore
prompting LLMs to estimate popularity without external corpora, which yields a
viable alternative.

Result: HaluCheck模型在多个指标上表现显著提升，最高提升24%，并在零样本设置中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 课程DPO方法和高品质负样本有效提升了幻觉检测性能，优于现有大型模型。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to accurately detect hallucinations
remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of hallucinated
text. Recognizing that hallucinated samples typically exhibit higher deceptive
quality than traditional negative samples, we use these carefully engineered
hallucinations as negative examples in the DPO alignment procedure. Our method
incorporates a curriculum learning strategy, gradually transitioning the
training from easier samples, identified based on the greatest reduction in
probability scores from independent fact checking models, to progressively
harder ones. This structured difficulty scaling ensures stable and incremental
learning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our HaluCheck models,
trained with curriculum DPO approach and high quality negative samples,
significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving
improvements of upto 24% on difficult benchmarks like MedHallu and HaluEval.
Additionally, HaluCheck models demonstrate robustness in zero-shot settings,
significantly outperforming larger state-of-the-art models across various
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补表格问答任务中自生成数据改进的空白，避免依赖昂贵的人工标注数据。

Result: 在领域内和领域外数据集上分别提升5%和2.4%，推理效率提高5倍。

Conclusion: PPT框架高效且性能优越，适用于表格问答任务的自改进。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) with self-generated data has
demonstrated success in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code
generation. Yet, no exploration has been made on table question answering
(TQA), where a system answers questions based on tabular data. Addressing this
gap is crucial for TQA, as effective self-improvement can boost performance
without requiring costly or manually annotated data. In this work, we propose
PPT, a Process-based Preference learning framework for TQA. It decomposes
reasoning chains into discrete states, assigns scores to each state, and
samples contrastive steps for preference learning. Experimental results show
that PPT effectively improves TQA models by up to 5% on in-domain datasets and
2.4% on out-of-domain datasets, with only 8,000 preference pairs. Furthermore,
the resulting models achieve competitive results compared to more complex and
larger state-of-the-art TQA systems, while being five times more efficient
during inference.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了大型推理模型（LRMs）在个性化任务中的表现，发现其并未显著优于通用大型语言模型（LLMs），并提出了一种新框架（Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization）以解决LRMs的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在数学和编码等任务中表现优异，但其在个性化任务中的潜力尚未充分探索，因此需要系统评估和改进。

Method: 提出Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization框架，包括分层推理思维模板、推理过程干预方法和交叉引用机制，以优化LRMs的表现。

Result: 实验表明，新框架显著优于现有技术，解决了LRMs在个性化任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过结构化推理和干预方法，LRMs在个性化任务中的表现可以得到显著提升，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Personalization is a critical task in modern intelligent systems, with
applications spanning diverse domains, including interactions with large
language models (LLMs). Recent advances in reasoning capabilities have
significantly enhanced LLMs, enabling unprecedented performance in tasks such
as mathematics and coding. However, their potential for personalization tasks
remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of large reasoning
models (LRMs) for personalization tasks. Surprisingly, despite generating more
tokens, LRMs do not consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs, especially in
retrieval-intensive scenarios where their advantages diminish. Our analysis
identifies three key limitations: divergent thinking, misalignment of response
formats, and ineffective use of retrieved information. To address these
challenges, we propose Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization (\model), a
novel framework that incorporates a hierarchical reasoning thought template to
guide LRMs in generating structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce a
reasoning process intervention method to enforce adherence to designed
reasoning patterns, enhancing alignment. We also propose a cross-referencing
mechanism to ensure consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的“干净数据后门攻击”方法，通过将触发器与无害的问答对关联，绕过安全防护机制，成功破解大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击容易被安全防护机制检测，且会破坏模型的安全对齐性，因此需要一种更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 使用无害的问答对将触发器与固定的良性回复前缀关联，通过梯度优化增强通用触发器的效果。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B模型上，攻击成功率分别达到86.67%和85%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效绕过防护机制，实现了高成功率的隐蔽攻击。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human
intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have
shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by
embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However,
existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily
detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2)
embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting
in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during
inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose
a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of
associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a
fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At
inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the
benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by
leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further
enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to
enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection
of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and
Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Agent Distillation的框架，旨在将大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力和任务解决行为转移到小型语言模型（sLMs）中，并结合检索和代码工具，以解决现有方法在罕见知识或精确计算场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但计算成本高，限制了实际部署。现有的方法通过链式思维（CoT）将推理能力蒸馏到小型模型（sLMs）中，但在需要罕见知识或精确计算的场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了Agent Distillation框架，包括两个改进方向：1）引入first-thought prefix提示方法提升教师模型生成轨迹的质量；2）提出self-consistent action generation方法提升小型模型在测试时的鲁棒性。

Result: 在八个推理任务上的实验表明，参数规模为0.5B、1.5B、3B的小型模型性能可与参数更大的模型（1.5B、3B、7B）竞争。

Conclusion: Agent Distillation框架展示了构建实用、工具化小型代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain
computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into
smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher
LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual
knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited
capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for
transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from
LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent
distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method
called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated
trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for
improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight
reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small
as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier
larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the
potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small
agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.

Motivation: 基于LLM的代理在多轮交互中效率低下，常陷入重复循环或发出无效命令，导致冗余计算开销。

Method: 提出两种方法：1. 内在方法（生成时注入退出指令）；2. 外在方法（验证任务完成以决定停止）。引入两个评估指标：冗余步骤减少和进度退化。

Result: 在4种LLM和5种环境中实验，显著提高效率且性能下降较小。验证了强代理辅助策略的实用性。

Conclusion: 早期退出机制有效提升效率，代码将开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
planning and decision-making capabilities in complex embodied environments.
However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn
interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective
commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying
solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the
early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary
approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions
during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task
completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit
mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of
$\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates
$\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4
different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency
improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a
practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent,
achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our
code to support further research.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）的发展，理解表格结构的能力变得尤为重要，尤其是在金融领域。然而，表格格式多样，现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在准确理解文档中的字符及其空间关系方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过结合表格内文本内容和布局特征来增强LVLM的表格理解能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些辅助模态显著提高了性能，能够在不依赖显式结构化输入格式的情况下稳健解释复杂文档布局。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LVLM在表格理解任务中的表现提供了有效途径。

Abstract: With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest
in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table
structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in
financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question
answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various
formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve
and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential
for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise,
current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives
of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding
characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we
propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating
in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate
that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling
robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly
structured input formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自修复现象（网络通过其他组件补偿被削弱的信号）掩盖了被削弱组件的真实重要性，导致传统方法低估其影响。

Method: 提出Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM)技术，在反向传播过程中考虑自修复效应。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和任务上的实验表明，GIM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GIM是理解大语言模型内部机制的重要进展，有助于提升模型安全性和改进性能。

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for
trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where
networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others,
masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work
attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that
compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within
the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of
important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based
methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to
these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM),
a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive
experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B,
Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves
faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution
methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner
mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their
safety. Our code is available at https://github.com/JoakimEdin/gim.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在临床预测任务中表现良好，但在需要更深层次上下文理解的任务（如30天再入院预测）中表现不佳，主要原因是结构化EHR数据语义信息有限。

Method: 提出了一种深度多模态对比学习框架，通过对齐结构化EHR数据和非结构化出院摘要笔记的潜在表示，优化下游任务性能。

Result: 该方法显著提升了性能，例如在30天再入院预测中，AUROC比XGBoost提高了4.1%。

Conclusion: 通过整合临床笔记的领域知识到EHR流程中，能够实现更准确和上下文感知的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning models, particularly tree-based approaches,
have demonstrated promising performance across various clinical prediction
tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. Despite their strengths, these
models struggle with tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such
as predicting 30-day hospital readmission. This can be primarily due to the
limited semantic information available in structured EHR data. To address this
limitation, we propose a deep multimodal contrastive learning (CL) framework
that aligns the latent representations of structured EHR data with unstructured
discharge summary notes. It works by pulling together paired EHR and text
embeddings while pushing apart unpaired ones. Fine-tuning the pretrained EHR
encoder extracted from this framework significantly boosts downstream task
performance, e.g., a 4.1% AUROC enhancement over XGBoost for 30-day readmission
prediction. Such results demonstrate the effect of integrating domain knowledge
from clinical notes into EHR-based pipelines, enabling more accurate and
context-aware clinical decision support systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务平台依赖LLM和VLM检测违规内容，但这些模型对规避性内容（表面合规但隐含违规的输入）的检测能力不足，现有基准测试无法满足这一需求。

Method: 提出EVADE基准测试，包含单违规任务（测试细粒度推理）和全合一任务（测试长上下文推理），并评估了26个主流模型。

Conclusion: EVADE为规避性内容检测提供了首个严格标准，揭示了当前多模态推理的局限性，为更安全的内容审核系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content.
However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or
images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly
conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce
overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far
harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for
this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first
expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset
contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding
product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health
supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities:
Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and
All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy
rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly
narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting
that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model
judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial
performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive
samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous
standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental
limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer
and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/koenshen/EVADE-Bench.

Motivation: LLMs常生成看似合理但错误的内容，现有检测方法忽视了自我一致错误（即模型在多轮采样中重复生成相同错误）。

Method: 定义了自我一致错误，评估了主流检测方法，并提出了一种融合外部验证LLM隐藏状态证据的跨模型探测方法。

Result: 发现自我一致错误的频率随模型规模增加而稳定或上升，现有检测方法对其效果不佳。跨模型方法显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前检测方法的局限性，跨模型方法为解决自我一致错误提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect
content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure
truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical
problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same
incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally
defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on
them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent
errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the
frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All
four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect
self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current
detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by
the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we
propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state
evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances
performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在人类-AI互动中的参与增加，评估其心理理论（ToM）能力，尤其是动态心理状态追踪能力，变得至关重要。现有基准主要关注静态心理状态，忽略了真实社交互动中的时间演化。

Method: 通过四步框架生成1,100个社交情境，包含5,500个场景和78,100个问题，并验证其真实性和质量。评估了十种先进LLM。

Result: LLM的平均表现比人类低44.7%，在追踪和推理心理状态变化时表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在建模人类心理状态动态性方面存在根本性局限。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI
interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly
their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing
benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static
snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that
characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a
novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand
and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected
scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social
contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for
realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs
reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with
performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift
of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in
current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

TL;DR: 论文提出QwenLong-L1框架，通过渐进式上下文扩展将短上下文推理模型（LRMs）适应长上下文任务，解决了训练效率低和优化不稳定的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在短上下文任务中表现优异，但在长上下文推理任务中仍存在挑战，如训练效率低和优化不稳定。

Method: 提出QwenLong-L1框架，包括预热监督微调（SFT）、课程引导的分阶段强化学习（RL）和难度感知的回顾采样策略。

Result: 在七个长上下文文档问答基准测试中，QwenLong-L1-32B表现优于OpenAI-o3-mini和Qwen3-235B-A22B，与Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking性能相当。

Conclusion: QwenLong-L1框架推动了长上下文推理模型的发展，能够在信息密集型环境中实现稳健推理。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning
capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). These improvements have
primarily been observed within the short-context reasoning tasks. In contrast,
extending LRMs to effectively process and reason on long-context inputs via RL
remains a critical unsolved challenge. To bridge this gap, we first formalize
the paradigm of long-context reasoning RL, and identify key challenges in
suboptimal training efficiency and unstable optimization process. To address
these issues, we propose QwenLong-L1, a framework that adapts short-context
LRMs to long-context scenarios via progressive context scaling. Specifically,
we utilize a warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust
initial policy, followed by a curriculum-guided phased RL technique to
stabilize the policy evolution, and enhanced with a difficulty-aware
retrospective sampling strategy to incentivize the policy exploration.
Experiments on seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that QwenLong-L1-32B outperforms flagship LRMs like OpenAI-o3-mini
and Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieving performance on par with
Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, demonstrating leading performance among
state-of-the-art LRMs. This work advances the development of practical
long-context LRMs capable of robust reasoning across information-intensive
environments.

Motivation: 多语言合成指令数据因翻译和本地化不足导致质量问题，影响多语言大语言模型的性能。

Method: MIDB基于16种语言的36.8k人工修订示例训练，自动修正内容和机器翻译缺陷，提升数据本地化。

Conclusion: MIDB有效解决了多语言合成指令数据的质量问题，为多语言大语言模型的优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Despite doubts on data quality, instruction synthesis has been widely applied
into instruction tuning (IT) of LLMs as an economic and rapid alternative.
Recent endeavors focus on improving data quality for synthesized instruction
pairs in English and have facilitated IT of English-centric LLMs. However, data
quality issues in multilingual synthesized instruction pairs are even more
severe, since the common synthesizing practice is to translate English
synthesized data into other languages using machine translation (MT). Besides
the known content errors in these English synthesized data, multilingual
synthesized instruction data are further exposed to defects introduced by MT
and face insufficient localization of the target languages. In this paper, we
propose MIDB, a Multilingual Instruction Data Booster to automatically address
the quality issues in multilingual synthesized data. MIDB is trained on around
36.8k revision examples across 16 languages by human linguistic experts,
thereby can boost the low-quality data by addressing content errors and MT
defects, and improving localization in these synthesized data. Both automatic
and human evaluation indicate that not only MIDB steadily improved instruction
data quality in 16 languages, but also the instruction-following and
cultural-understanding abilities of multilingual LLMs fine-tuned on
MIDB-boosted data were significantly enhanced.

TL;DR: BehaviorLM通过渐进式微调方法，解决了LLM在预测长尾行为时过拟合常见行为的问题，显著提升了模型对罕见行为的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测用户行为对智能助手服务至关重要，但现有深度学习模型难以捕捉长尾行为。LLM虽具备丰富行为知识，但微调方法容易过拟合常见行为，影响罕见行为预测。

Method: 提出BehaviorLM，分两阶段微调：第一阶段微调常见行为并保留通用知识；第二阶段基于样本难度平衡所有行为，提升罕见行为预测而不牺牲常见行为性能。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，BehaviorLM能稳健预测常见和罕见行为，并有效利用LLM知识实现少样本罕见行为预测。

Conclusion: BehaviorLM通过渐进式微调，显著提升了LLM对长尾行为的预测能力，为智能助手服务提供了更全面的行为预测解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting user behavior is essential for intelligent assistant services, yet
deep learning models often struggle to capture long-tailed behaviors. Large
language models (LLMs), with their pretraining on vast corpora containing rich
behavioral knowledge, offer promise. However, existing fine-tuning approaches
tend to overfit to frequent ``anchor'' behaviors, reducing their ability to
predict less common ``tail'' behaviors. In this paper, we introduce BehaviorLM,
a progressive fine-tuning approach that addresses this issue. In the first
stage, LLMs are fine-tuned on anchor behaviors while preserving general
behavioral knowledge. In the second stage, fine-tuning uses a balanced subset
of all behaviors based on sample difficulty to improve tail behavior
predictions without sacrificing anchor performance. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaviorLM robustly predicts both anchor
and tail behaviors and effectively leverages LLM behavioral knowledge to master
tail behavior prediction with few-shot examples.

Conclusion: 通过图论分析和数据过滤策略，有效减少LLM评估中的非传递性问题，提升模型评估的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as evaluators for open-ended
tasks, while previous research has emphasized biases in LLM evaluations, the
issue of non-transitivity in pairwise comparisons remains unresolved:
non-transitive preferences for pairwise comparisons, where evaluators prefer A
over B, B over C, but C over A. Our results suggest that low-quality training
data may reduce the transitivity of preferences generated by the Evaluator LLM.
To address this, We propose a graph-theoretic framework to analyze and mitigate
this problem by modeling pairwise preferences as tournament graphs. We quantify
non-transitivity and introduce directed graph structural entropy to measure the
overall clarity of preferences. Our analysis reveals significant
non-transitivity in advanced Evaluator LLMs (with Qwen2.5-Max exhibiting
67.96%), as well as high entropy values (0.8095 for Qwen2.5-Max), reflecting
low overall clarity of preferences. To address this issue, we designed a
filtering strategy, ELSPR, to eliminate preference data that induces
non-transitivity, retaining only consistent and transitive preference data for
model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with filtered
data reduce non-transitivity by 13.78% (from 64.28% to 50.50%), decrease
structural entropy by 0.0879 (from 0.8113 to 0.7234), and align more closely
with human evaluators (human agreement rate improves by 0.6% and Spearman
correlation increases by 0.01).

Conclusion: 该方法为激发LLM的长链思维能力提供了一种无需训练的有效技术，并展示了激活动态的可预测性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) ability in large language models (LLMs) typically
requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on
high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this
capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few
layers largely governs long-form reasoning attributes, such as output length
and self-reflection. By simply amplifying these activations and inserting
"wait" tokens, we can invoke the long CoT ability without any training,
resulting in significantly increased self-reflection rates and accuracy.
Moreover, we find that the activation dynamics follow predictable trajectories,
with a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay.
Building on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation
control technique. It leverages a few contrastive examples to identify key
activations, and employs simple analytic functions to modulate their values at
inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our method in efficiently eliciting long CoT reasoning in LLMs
and improving their performance. Additionally, we propose a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method that trains only a last-layer activation amplification
module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming full LoRA fine-tuning on reasoning
benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. Our code and data are publicly
released.

Result: 成功定位并验证了LLM中与价值观相关的神经元，证明其可操纵性。

Conclusion: ValueLocate为LLM的价值观对齐提供了新方法，将心理学框架与神经元分析结合。

Abstract: Rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into societal applications
has intensified concerns about their alignment with universal ethical
principles, as their internal value representations remain opaque despite
behavioral alignment advancements. Current approaches struggle to
systematically interpret how values are encoded in neural architectures,
limited by datasets that prioritize superficial judgments over mechanistic
analysis. We introduce ValueLocate, a mechanistic interpretability framework
grounded in the Schwartz Values Survey, to address this gap. Our method first
constructs ValueInsight, a dataset that operationalizes four dimensions of
universal value through behavioral contexts in the real world. Leveraging this
dataset, we develop a neuron identification method that calculates activation
differences between opposing value aspects, enabling precise localization of
value-critical neurons without relying on computationally intensive attribution
methods. Our proposed validation method demonstrates that targeted manipulation
of these neurons effectively alters model value orientations, establishing
causal relationships between neurons and value representations. This work
advances the foundation for value alignment by bridging psychological value
frameworks with neuron analysis in LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在复杂推理任务中仅靠扩大模型规模或训练数据难以取得进一步进展。

Method: 提出Fast Quiet STaR，采用课程学习策略逐步减少思考令牌数量，并通过强化学习微调扩展至标准Next Token Prediction（NTP）设置。

Result: 在Mistral 7B和Qwen2.5 7B上，Fast Quiet-STaR NTP的平均准确率分别提高了9%和5.7%，同时保持相同的推理延迟。

Conclusion: Fast Quiet STaR在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了模型性能，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances
demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require
more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising
direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently,
Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought
traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose
Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the
benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method
introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces
the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract
and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the
standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement
learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates
the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on
four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast
Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy
under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an
average accuracy improvement of 9\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\% on Qwen2.5 7B,
while maintaining the same inference latency. Our code will be available at

Result: 发现语言判别能力随训练下降并集中于低层，而语义判别能力随时间增强并稳定于深层。

Conclusion: ABX任务为分析多语言表征结构提供了一种轻量级框架，并与语言学学习性能有一定关联。

Abstract: We introduce a set of training-free ABX-style discrimination tasks to
evaluate how multilingual language models represent language identity (form)
and semantic content (meaning). Inspired from speech processing, these
zero-shot tasks measure whether minimal differences in representation can be
reliably detected. This offers a flexible and interpretable alternative to
probing. Applied to XLM-R (Conneau et al, 2020) across pretraining checkpoints
and layers, we find that language discrimination declines over training and
becomes concentrated in lower layers, while meaning discrimination strengthens
over time and stabilizes in deeper layers. We then explore probing tasks,
showing some alignment between our metrics and linguistic learning performance.
Our results position ABX tasks as a lightweight framework for analyzing the
structure of multilingual representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval mechanisms have
demonstrated significant potential in fact-checking tasks by integrating
external knowledge. However, their reliability decreases when confronted with
conflicting evidence from sources of varying credibility. This paper presents
the first systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models
for fact-checking in the presence of conflicting evidence. To support this
study, we introduce \textbf{CONFACT} (\textbf{Con}flicting Evidence for
\textbf{Fact}-Checking) (Dataset available at
https://github.com/zoeyyes/CONFACT), a novel dataset comprising questions
paired with conflicting information from various sources. Extensive experiments
reveal critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art RAG methods, particularly
in resolving conflicts stemming from differences in media source credibility.
To address these challenges, we investigate strategies to integrate media
background information into both the retrieval and generation stages. Our
results show that effectively incorporating source credibility significantly
enhances the ability of RAG models to resolve conflicting evidence and improve
fact-checking performance.

Result: 通过优化Agent ROI，可以逐步缩小LLM代理的可用性差距，实现其在大众市场的规模化应用。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁研究者从效用角度重新思考LLM代理的发展方向，以实现其真正的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI
interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents
capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the
widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and
scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand,
mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited
real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model
capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent
can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a
shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven
perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return
on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic
ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development
trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the
information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We
outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current
usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and
effective in real-world contexts.

Conclusion: 压缩破解通过结合表示空间的几何失真，显著增强了对语言模型的信息学解释。

Abstract: Recently, the concept of ``compression as intelligence'' has provided a novel
informatics metric perspective for language models (LMs), emphasizing that
highly structured representations signify the intelligence level of LMs.
However, from a geometric standpoint, the word representation space of highly
compressed LMs tends to degenerate into a highly anisotropic state, which
hinders the LM's ability to comprehend instructions and directly impacts its
performance. We found this compression-anisotropy synchronicity is essentially
the ``Compression Hacking'' in LM representations, where noise-dominated
directions tend to create the illusion of high compression rates by sacrificing
spatial uniformity. Based on this, we propose three refined compression metrics
by incorporating geometric distortion analysis and integrate them into a
self-evaluation pipeline. The refined metrics exhibit strong alignment with the
LM's comprehensive capabilities, achieving Spearman correlation coefficients
above 0.9, significantly outperforming both the original compression and other
internal structure-based metrics. This confirms that compression hacking
substantially enhances the informatics interpretation of LMs by incorporating
geometric distortion of representations.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents excel at reactive dialogue but struggle

Q-network over fixed BERT embeddings trained via temporal-difference learning
to select optimal moves within this reduced space. By tracking the user's
emotions, DialogXpert tailors each decision to advance the task while nurturing
a genuine, empathetic connection. Across negotiation, emotional support, and
tutoring benchmarks, DialogXpert drives conversations to under $3$ turns with
success rates exceeding 94\% and, with a larger LLM prior, pushes success above

Method: 提出short-m@k方法，并行生成k个独立推理链，选择前m个完成的结果进行多数投票。

Result: short-m@k在低计算设置下性能优于标准多数投票，节省40%计算资源；short-3@k在所有计算预算下表现更优，减少33%时间。

Conclusion: 短推理链训练LLM效果更好，长推理链可能降低性能，需重新思考LLM推理时的计算策略。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time
compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking"
chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs
significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge
the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning
capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within
individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers -
up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question.
Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference
method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts
computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is
chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates
similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in
low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while
slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting
across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33%
wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short,
long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on
the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking
current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer
"thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can,
counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的神经机器翻译系统，用于标准中文与粤语书面语之间的翻译，并通过挖掘维基百科中的相似句子对提升翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 香港居民日常使用粤语，但书面语多为标准中文，两者在词汇和语法上有显著差异。随着网络交流增加，对中文与粤语自动翻译的需求日益明显。

Method: 研究采用Transformer模型，通过收集28K平行句对和从维基百科自动提取72K相似句对，构建训练数据。

Result: 系统在BLEU评分上优于百度翻译的6/8测试集，并能捕捉中文与粤语间的关键语言转换。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘高质量平行数据，系统显著提升了中文到粤语的翻译性能，为语言处理领域提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The majority of inhabitants in Hong Kong are able to read and write in
standard Chinese but use Cantonese as the primary spoken language in daily
life. Spoken Cantonese can be transcribed into Chinese characters, which
constitute the so-called written Cantonese. Written Cantonese exhibits
significant lexical and grammatical differences from standard written Chinese.
The rise of written Cantonese is increasingly evident in the cyber world. The
growing interaction between Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers is leading
to a clear demand for automatic translation between Chinese and Cantonese. This
paper describes a transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) system for
written-Chinese-to-written-Cantonese translation. Given that parallel text data
of Chinese and Cantonese are extremely scarce, a major focus of this study is
on the effort of preparing good amount of training data for NMT. In addition to
collecting 28K parallel sentences from previous linguistic studies and
scattered internet resources, we devise an effective approach to obtaining 72K
parallel sentences by automatically extracting pairs of semantically similar
sentences from parallel articles on Chinese Wikipedia and Cantonese Wikipedia.
We show that leveraging highly similar sentence pairs mined from Wikipedia
improves translation performance in all test sets. Our system outperforms Baidu
Fanyi's Chinese-to-Cantonese translation on 6 out of 8 test sets in BLEU
scores. Translation examples reveal that our system is able to capture
important linguistic transformations between standard Chinese and spoken
Cantonese.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为条件令牌选择（CTS）的令牌级压缩框架，旨在解决现代推理模型的高延迟、高资源消耗和过度思考问题，通过选择性保留关键令牌来压缩思维链（CoT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推理模型（如OpenAI的o1和DeepSeek-R1）存在高推理延迟、高计算资源消耗和过度冗余的问题，需要一种高效的方法来优化思维链的生成。

Method: 提出条件令牌选择（CTS）框架，通过条件重要性评分评估每个令牌对答案的贡献，并训练模型使用压缩后的思维链。

Result: 在GPQA基准测试中，使用CTS训练的Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct模型实现了9.1%的准确率提升，同时减少了13.2%的推理令牌和13%的训练令牌。进一步减少42%的训练令牌仅导致5%的准确率下降，但推理令牌减少了75.8%。

Conclusion: CTS有效地压缩了思维链，显著减少了冗余令牌，同时保持了强大的推理性能，证明了现有思维链中存在大量冗余。

Abstract: Modern reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit
impressive problem-solving capabilities but suffer from critical
inefficiencies: high inference latency, excessive computational resource
consumption, and a tendency toward overthinking -- generating verbose chains of
thought (CoT) laden with redundant tokens that contribute minimally to the
final answer. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection
(CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable
compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens
in CoT. CTS evaluates each token's contribution to deriving correct answers
using conditional importance scoring, then trains models on compressed CoT.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTS effectively compresses long CoT
while maintaining strong reasoning performance. Notably, on the GPQA benchmark,
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with CTS achieves a 9.1% accuracy improvement with
13.2% fewer reasoning tokens (13% training token reduction). Further reducing
training tokens by 42% incurs only a marginal 5% accuracy drop while yielding a
75.8% reduction in reasoning tokens, highlighting the prevalence of redundancy
in existing CoT.

Motivation: 现有的Test-Time Scaling方法（如Beam Search和DVTS）虽然通过增加计算资源提高了推理准确性，但存在路径同质化和中间结果利用效率低的问题。

Method: SRCA框架包含两个关键策略：(1) Answer-Clustered Search，通过按中间检查点答案分组保持路径多样性；(2) Checkpoint Candidate Augmentation，利用所有中间答案进行最终决策。

Result: 实验结果表明，SRCA在多个数学数据集上的推理准确性优于现有TTS方法。

Conclusion: SRCA通过检查点策略有效解决了路径同质化和中间结果利用问题，显著提升了数学推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a
powerful capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can be further
enhanced through Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods like Beam Search and DVTS.
However, these methods, despite improving accuracy by allocating more
computational resources during inference, often suffer from path homogenization
and inefficient use of intermediate results. To address these limitations, we
propose Stepwise Reasoning Checkpoint Analysis (SRCA), a framework that
introduces checkpoints between reasoning steps. It incorporates two key
strategies: (1) Answer-Clustered Search, which groups reasoning paths by their
intermediate checkpoint answers to maintain diversity while ensuring quality,
and (2) Checkpoint Candidate Augmentation, which leverages all intermediate
answers for final decision-making. Our approach effectively reduces path
homogenization and creates a fault-tolerant mechanism by utilizing high-quality
intermediate results. Experimental results show that SRCA improves reasoning
accuracy compared to existing TTS methods across various mathematical datasets.

Abstract: Clear and effective explanations are essential for human understanding and
knowledge dissemination. The scope of scientific research aiming to understand
the essence of explanations has recently expanded from the social sciences to
machine learning and artificial intelligence. Explanations for machine learning
decisions must be impactful and human-like, and there is a lack of large-scale
datasets focusing on human-like and human-generated explanations. This work
aims to provide such a dataset by: extracting sentences that indicate
explanations from scientific literature among various sources in the
biotechnology and biophysics topic domains (e.g. PubMed's PMC Open Access
subset); providing a multi-class notation derived inductively from the data;
evaluating annotator consensus on the emerging categories. The sentences are
organized in an openly-available dataset, with two different classifications
(6-class and 3-class category annotation), and the 3-class notation achieves a
0.667 Krippendorf Alpha value.

Abstract: Study of affect in speech requires suitable data, as emotional expression and
perception vary across languages. Until now, no corpus has existed for natural
expression of affect in spontaneous Finnish, existing data being acted or from
a very specific communicative setting. This paper presents the first such
corpus, created by annotating 12,000 utterances for emotional arousal and
valence, sampled from three large-scale Finnish speech corpora. To ensure
diverse affective expression, sample selection was conducted with an affect
mining approach combining acoustic, cross-linguistic speech emotion, and text
sentiment features. We compare this method to random sampling in terms of
annotation diversity, and conduct post-hoc analyses to identify sampling
choices that would have maximized the diversity. As an outcome, the work
introduces a spontaneous Finnish affective speech corpus and informs sampling
strategies for affective speech corpus creation in other languages or domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如数值不确定性或模糊表达）无法解释由证据冲突引起的不确定性，用户难以依赖输出或解决分歧。

Method: CLUE通过无监督方式识别文本中的冲突与一致性关系，并通过提示和注意力引导生成解释。

Result: 在三个语言模型和两个事实核查数据集上，CLUE生成的解释更忠实于模型不确定性，且人类评估认为其更有帮助、信息量更大。

Conclusion: CLUE通过明确将不确定性与证据冲突联系起来，为事实核查等任务提供实用支持，并可推广到其他需要复杂信息推理的任务。

Abstract: Understanding sources of a model's uncertainty regarding its predictions is
crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Prior work proposes using
numerical uncertainty or hedges ("I'm not sure, but ..."), which do not explain
uncertainty that arises from conflicting evidence, leaving users unable to
resolve disagreements or rely on the output. We introduce CLUE
(Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the
first framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty
by (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose
claim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the
model's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating
explanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical
interactions. Across three language models and two fact-checking datasets, we
show that CLUE produces explanations that are more faithful to the model's
uncertainty and more consistent with fact-checking decisions than prompting for
uncertainty explanations without span-interaction guidance. Human evaluators
judge our explanations to be more helpful, more informative, less redundant,
and more logically consistent with the input than this baseline. CLUE requires
no fine-tuning or architectural changes, making it plug-and-play for any
white-box language model. By explicitly linking uncertainty to evidence
conflicts, it offers practical support for fact-checking and generalises
readily to other tasks that require reasoning over complex information.

Conclusion: 该方法为提升AI模型的事实性提供了一种新范式，并提出了伦理和治理措施以确保安全使用虚假数据。

Abstract: Generative AI models often learn and reproduce false information present in
their training corpora. This position paper argues that, analogous to
biological immunization, where controlled exposure to a weakened pathogen
builds immunity, AI models should be fine tuned on small, quarantined sets of
explicitly labeled falsehoods as a "vaccine" against misinformation. These
curated false examples are periodically injected during finetuning,
strengthening the model ability to recognize and reject misleading claims while
preserving accuracy on truthful inputs. An illustrative case study shows that
immunized models generate substantially less misinformation than baselines. To
our knowledge, this is the first training framework that treats fact checked
falsehoods themselves as a supervised vaccine, rather than relying on input
perturbations or generic human feedback signals, to harden models against
future misinformation. We also outline ethical safeguards and governance
controls to ensure the safe use of false data. Model immunization offers a
proactive paradigm for aligning AI systems with factuality.

Conclusion: 实验引导的排序方法在模拟环境中有效，为实际科学发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery,
particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and
throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking,
relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without
incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of
experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based
on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies
is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real
experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator
grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance
as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by
noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally
reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we
develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by
shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights
derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method
outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.

Conclusion: Mutarjim展示了小模型在翻译任务中的潜力，Tarjama-25为未来研究提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for
bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown
impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine
translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim
based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English.
Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several
established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training
approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental
results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while
significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also
introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in
existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short
sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000
expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a
more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in
Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like
GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and
advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.

Method: 使用GPT2风格的语言模型，在控制的k跳推理数据集（k=2,3,4）上从头训练。

Result: 模型能学习隐式k跳推理，但训练数据需求随k指数增长，模型层数需求随k线性增长。

Conclusion: 数据需求可通过课程学习缓解，但无法完全消除，且模型深度增长是必要的。

Abstract: Implicit reasoning is the ability of a language model to solve multi-hop
reasoning tasks in a single forward pass, without chain of thought. We
investigate this capability using GPT2-style language models trained from
scratch on controlled $k$-hop reasoning datasets ($k = 2, 3, 4$). We show that
while such models can indeed learn implicit $k$-hop reasoning, the required
training data grows exponentially in $k$, and the required number of
transformer layers grows linearly in $k$. We offer a theoretical explanation
for why this depth growth is necessary. We further find that the data
requirement can be mitigated, but not eliminated, through curriculum learning.

Method: 评估多种嵌入模型对物理相关符号表达的处理能力，通过相似性分析和机器学习管道集成两种方法进行性能评估。

Result: GPT-text-embedding-3-large表现最佳，但优势不明显，其他模型表现差异显著。

Conclusion: LA研究者和从业者在处理含符号表达的科学语言时需谨慎选择NLP嵌入模型，并综合考虑性能、成本、合规性和透明度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have facilitated the
analysis of student-generated language products in learning analytics (LA),
particularly through the use of NLP embedding models. Yet when it comes to
science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas
introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address.
Existing studies and applications often either overlook these challenges or
remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased findings
and diminished performance of LA applications. This study therefore explores
how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and
interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding
models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from
authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches:
similarity-based analyses and integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our
findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's
GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its
advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Beyond
performance, additional factors such as cost, regulatory compliance, and model
transparency are discussed as key considerations for model selection. Overall,
this study underscores the importance for LA researchers and practitioners of
carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related
language products that include symbolic expressions.

TL;DR: AlphaMed是首个仅通过强化学习（RL）在公共多选题QA数据集上实现推理能力的医学LLM，无需监督微调（SFT）或链式思维（CoT）数据，并在多个医学QA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务性能和可解释决策的挑战，尤其是在临床应用中，传统方法依赖昂贵的SFT和CoT数据，AlphaMed探索了仅通过RL实现推理的可能性。

Method: 使用基于规则的简约奖励机制，在公共多选题QA数据集上进行强化学习，避免依赖SFT或CoT数据。

Result: AlphaMed在六个医学QA基准测试中达到最优性能，甚至超越更大或闭源模型（如DeepSeek-V3-671B和Claude-3.5-Sonnet）。

Conclusion: 数据集信息量是推理性能的关键驱动因素，简约RL在信息丰富的多选题数据上能有效诱导推理，但当前评估存在局限性，需更具挑战性的医学QA基准。

Abstract: Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision
making in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications,
requires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the
first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through
reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public
multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data.
AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks,
outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging
benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source
models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the
factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis
guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize
reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and
diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the
emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset
informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist
RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning
without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks,
underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more
challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.

example where AI can be very helpful. We solve the problem by combining a novel
approach we propose and the powerful coding skills of AI. Our results use
delicate graph theory and contain new formulas for general cases that have not
been discovered before. We find that, while AI is unable to solve the problem
all by itself, it is able to solve it if we provide it with a clear strategy, a
step-by-step guidance and carefully written prompts. For simplicity, we focus

Result: 数据集在判决一致性上达到κ=0.742，QA对一致性为74.7%。

Conclusion: AVerImaTeC为图像-文本声明的验证提供了高质量的数据集和基线方法。

Abstract: Textual claims are often accompanied by images to enhance their credibility
and spread on social media, but this also raises concerns about the spread of
misinformation. Existing datasets for automated verification of image-text
claims remain limited, as they often consist of synthetic claims and lack
evidence annotations to capture the reasoning behind the verdict. In this work,
we introduce AVerImaTeC, a dataset consisting of 1,297 real-world image-text
claims. Each claim is annotated with question-answer (QA) pairs containing
evidence from the web, reflecting a decomposed reasoning regarding the verdict.
We mitigate common challenges in fact-checking datasets such as contextual
dependence, temporal leakage, and evidence insufficiency, via claim
normalization, temporally constrained evidence annotation, and a two-stage
sufficiency check. We assess the consistency of the annotation in AVerImaTeC
via inter-annotator studies, achieving a $\kappa=0.742$ on verdicts and
$74.7\%$ consistency on QA pairs. We also propose a novel evaluation method for
evidence retrieval and conduct extensive experiments to establish baselines for
verifying image-text claims using open-web evidence.

Method: 提出TRACE框架和ABSynth数据生成方法，结合几何、信息和语言信号分析阶段转变。

Result: 实验发现阶段转变与曲率崩溃和维度稳定相关，且与句法和语义准确性涌现一致。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为语言模型的语言抽象涌现提供了新见解，有助于模型解释性和训练效率的提升。

Abstract: Modern transformer models exhibit phase transitions during training, distinct
shifts from memorisation to abstraction, but the mechanisms underlying these
transitions remain poorly understood. Prior work has often focused on endpoint
representations or isolated signals like curvature or mutual information,
typically in symbolic or arithmetic domains, overlooking the emergence of
linguistic structure. We introduce TRACE (Tracking Representation Abstraction
and Compositional Emergence), a diagnostic framework combining geometric,
informational, and linguistic signals to detect phase transitions in
Transformer-based LMs. TRACE leverages a frame-semantic data generation method,
ABSynth, that produces annotated synthetic corpora with controllable
complexity, lexical distributions, and structural entropy, while being fully
annotated with linguistic categories, enabling precise analysis of abstraction
emergence. Experiments reveal that (i) phase transitions align with clear
intersections between curvature collapse and dimension stabilisation; (ii)
these geometric shifts coincide with emerging syntactic and semantic accuracy;
(iii) abstraction patterns persist across architectural variants, with
components like feedforward networks affecting optimisation stability rather
than fundamentally altering trajectories. This work advances our understanding
of how linguistic abstractions emerge in LMs, offering insights into model
interpretability, training efficiency, and compositional generalisation that
could inform more principled approaches to LM development.

*Prince Kumar,Rudra Murthy,Riyaz Bhat,Danish Contractor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出通过微调LLMs，将指令重新表达为伪代码以提高模型遵循指令的能力，并在多个任务上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs能力快速提升，但在遵循简单、明确指令（尤其是涉及组合时）仍有困难。伪代码可能帮助模型更好地理解指令，但编写伪代码对非专家用户不友好。

Method: 提出在指令调优数据中加入伪代码表达的指令，并微调LLMs。评估了11个公开基准任务，包括指令遵循、数学和常识推理。

Result: 实验显示，使用伪代码训练的模型在指令遵循任务上相对提升3-19%，所有任务平均提升达14%，同时保留其他任务能力。

Conclusion: 伪代码辅助的指令调优显著提升LLMs的指令遵循能力，且不影响其他任务表现。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they continue to have difficulty following relatively simple,
unambiguous instructions, especially when compositions are involved. In this
paper, we take inspiration from recent work that suggests that models may
follow instructions better when they are expressed in pseudo-code. However,
writing pseudo-code programs can be tedious and using few-shot demonstrations
to craft code representations for use in inference can be unnatural for
non-expert users of LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose fine-tuning
LLMs with instruction-tuning data that additionally includes instructions
re-expressed in pseudo-code along with the final response. We evaluate models
trained using our method on $11$ publicly available benchmarks comprising of
tasks related to instruction-following, mathematics, and common-sense
reasoning. We conduct rigorous experiments with $5$ different models and find
that not only do models follow instructions better when trained with
pseudo-code, they also retain their capabilities on the other tasks related to
mathematical and common sense reasoning. Specifically, we observe a relative
gain of $3$--$19$% on instruction-following benchmark, and an average gain of
upto 14% across all tasks.

### [166] [Contrastive Distillation of Emotion Knowledge from LLMs for Zero-Shot Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18040)
*Minxue Niu,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种对比蒸馏框架，将大型语言模型（LLM）的情感知识迁移到紧凑模型中，无需人工标注，实现零样本情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别模型依赖固定标签集训练，泛化能力有限；LLM虽表现优异，但规模大难以部署在边缘设备。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成情感描述作为监督信号，通过对比学习在共享嵌入空间对齐文本样本与情感描述。

Result: 蒸馏模型在多个数据集和标签空间上表现优异，接近GPT-4的零样本性能，且体积小10,000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高效、可扩展的情感识别系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to handle various emotion labels without dedicated training is
crucial for building adaptable Emotion Recognition (ER) systems. Conventional
ER models rely on training using fixed label sets and struggle to generalize
beyond them. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
zero-shot ER performance across diverse label spaces, but their scale limits
their use on edge devices. In this work, we propose a contrastive distillation
framework that transfers rich emotional knowledge from LLMs into a compact
model without the use of human annotations. We use GPT-4 to generate
descriptive emotion annotations, offering rich supervision beyond fixed label
sets. By aligning text samples with emotion descriptors in a shared embedding
space, our method enables zero-shot prediction on different emotion classes,
granularity, and label schema. The distilled model is effective across multiple
datasets and label spaces, outperforming strong baselines of similar size and
approaching GPT-4's zero-shot performance, while being over 10,000 times
smaller.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学问题解决中提供个性化反馈的能力，并引入了MathEDU数据集。实验表明模型在识别正确性方面表现良好，但在生成详细教学反馈方面仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习缺乏即时个性化反馈，尤其是在数学问题解决中纠正错误的能力。研究旨在利用LLMs填补这一空白。

Method: 使用MathEDU数据集（包含真实学生解答和教师反馈），评估LLMs在两种情境下的表现：有学生历史答案和无历史答案（冷启动）。

Result: 微调后的模型在识别解答正确性方面表现良好，但在生成详细教学反馈方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学教育中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以生成更有效的教学反馈。

Abstract: Online learning enhances educational accessibility, offering students the
flexibility to learn anytime, anywhere. However, a key limitation is the lack
of immediate, personalized feedback, particularly in helping students correct
errors in math problem-solving. Several studies have investigated the
applications of large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts. In this
paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to assess students' math
problem-solving processes and provide adaptive feedback. The MathEDU dataset is
introduced, comprising authentic student solutions annotated with teacher
feedback. We evaluate the model's ability to support personalized learning in
two scenarios: one where the model has access to students' prior answer
histories, and another simulating a cold-start context. Experimental results
show that the fine-tuned model performs well in identifying correctness.
However, the model still faces challenges in generating detailed feedback for
pedagogical purposes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在归纳推理方面的能力，特别是通过个性化偏好推断任务，提出了一种名为AlignXplore的模型，结合冷启动训练和在线强化学习，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学和编程等演绎推理任务中表现出色，但在归纳推理（从不完整证据中推导一般规则）方面研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在LLM对齐中的个性化偏好推断任务上。

Method: 提出AlignXplore模型，结合基于合成数据的冷启动训练和在线强化学习，从用户交互历史中系统推断偏好。

Result: 实验表明，AlignXplore在领域内和领域外基准测试中平均提升11.05%，同时保持对不同输入格式和下游模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AlignXplore不仅显著提升了偏好推断性能，还揭示了训练过程中涌现的类人归纳推理模式，为偏好推断学习提供了最佳实践。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex
reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where
deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning\textemdash the ability to
derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This
paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of
personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where
current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task
demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are
typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring
models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We
propose \textsc{AlignXplore}, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains
to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users'
interaction histories. We develop \textsc{AlignXplore} by combining cold-start
training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{AlignXplore}
achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of
11.05\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong
generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models.
Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning
through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing
the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.

TL;DR: QwenLong-CPRS是一个针对长上下文优化的上下文压缩框架，通过动态优化机制和多粒度压缩，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列处理中预填充阶段的高计算开销和LLMs的'中间迷失'性能下降问题。

Method: 采用自然语言指导的动态优化、双向推理层、令牌批判机制和窗口并行推理等四项创新技术。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，支持主流LLMs，实现了21.59倍的上下文压缩和19.15点的平均性能提升。

Conclusion: QwenLong-CPRS在长上下文处理中实现了新的SOTA性能，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This technical report presents QwenLong-CPRS, a context compression framework
designed for explicit long-context optimization, addressing prohibitive
computation overhead during the prefill stage and the "lost in the middle"
performance degradation of large language models (LLMs) during long sequence
processing. Implemented through a novel dynamic context optimization mechanism,
QwenLong-CPRS enables multi-granularity context compression guided by natural
language instructions, achieving both efficiency gains and improved
performance.
  Evolved from the Qwen architecture series, QwenLong-CPRS introduces four key
innovations: (1) Natural language-guided dynamic optimization, (2)
Bidirectional reasoning layers for enhanced boundary awareness, (3) Token
critic mechanisms with language modeling heads, and (4) Window-parallel
inference.
  Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (4K-2M word contexts)
demonstrate QwenLong-CPRS's threefold effectiveness: (1) Consistent superiority
over other context management methods like RAG and sparse attention in both
accuracy and efficiency. (2) Architecture-agnostic integration with all
flagship LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini2.0-pro, Claude3.7-sonnet, DeepSeek-v3,
and Qwen2.5-max, achieves 21.59$\times$ context compression alongside
19.15-point average performance gains; (3) Deployed with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
QwenLong-CPRS surpasses leading proprietary LLMs by 4.85 and 10.88 points on
Ruler-128K and InfiniteBench, establishing new SOTA performance.

*Joey Hong,Anca Dragan,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标条件价值函数的方法，用于指导大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮交互任务中的推理和规划，解决了强化学习（RL）微调的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在问答和对话等任务中表现出色，但在需要多轮交互的复杂任务（如谈判和说服）中，RL微调存在内存和计算成本高的问题，且大型LLM缺乏必要的API支持。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的目标条件价值函数，用于预测任务的可能结果，帮助LLM评估多种行动方案。这些价值函数在推理步骤而非完整动作上进行训练，以支持多轮交互中的高效决策。

Result: 在工具使用、社交推理和对话等任务中，该方法表现优于RL微调和提示方法，同时保持了高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过目标条件价值函数，该方法为LLM在多轮交互任务中的推理和规划提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and
dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and
persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning.
Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle,
but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn
RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated
when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the
APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to
improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather
than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses
goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that
scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task
will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple
possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In
addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than
full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates
decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks
requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue,
demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting
methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于网络的LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但其能力大多被封闭在专有系统中，架构不透明。

Method: ManuSearch框架包含三个智能体：解决方案规划智能体、互联网搜索智能体和结构化网页阅读智能体，协同完成深度搜索和推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，ManuSearch显著优于现有开源基线，甚至超越领先的闭源系统。

Conclusion: ManuSearch为开放深度搜索系统的可复现和可扩展研究铺平了道路，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in web-augmented large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, yet these capabilities are
mostly locked in proprietary systems with opaque architectures. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework
designed to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search
and reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning
agent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent
that retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a
structured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web
content. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce
\textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over
long-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results
show that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and
even surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for
reproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the
data and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在融合和解释音频信息方面表现不佳，限制了视频时间理解的全面性。

Method: TriSense通过Query-Based Connector动态调整模态权重，支持灵活的输入组合，并利用TriSense-2M数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明TriSense在多模态视频分析中表现优异。

Conclusion: TriSense为多模态视频分析提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and
auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist
passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music
plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous
processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often
struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their
capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we
present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic
video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and
speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that
adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling
robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of
available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce
TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated
via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes
long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad
generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video
analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UNJOIN是一个两阶段框架，通过解耦模式元素检索与SQL逻辑生成，提升了多表数据库Text-to-SQL的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多表数据库中难以准确检索表与列、生成复杂JOINs和UNIONs，且泛化能力不足。

Method: UNJOIN将多表列名合并为单表表示，简化检索；随后生成SQL并映射回原模式。

Result: 在SPIDER和BIRD数据集上，UNJOIN达到或超越现有最佳基线。

Conclusion: UNJOIN仅需模式信息，无需数据访问或微调，具有高扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
Text-to-SQL performance for single-table queries. But, it remains challenging
in multi-table databases due to complex schema and relational operations.
Existing methods often struggle with retrieving the right tables and columns,
generating accurate JOINs and UNIONs, and generalizing across diverse schemas.
To address these issues, we introduce UNJOIN, a two-stage framework that
decouples the retrieval of schema elements from SQL logic generation. In the
first stage, we merge the column names of all tables in the database into a
single-table representation by prefixing each column with its table name. This
allows the model to focus purely on accurate retrieval without being distracted
by the need to write complex SQL logic. In the second stage, the SQL query is
generated on this simplified schema and mapped back to the original schema by
reconstructing JOINs, UNIONs, and relational logic. Evaluations on SPIDER and
BIRD datasets show that UNJOIN matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art
baselines. UNJOIN uses only schema information, which does not require data
access or fine-tuning, making it scalable and adaptable across databases.

TL;DR: Frankentexts是一种由LLMs生成的长篇叙事，要求大部分内容（如90%）必须直接复制人类文本。该任务测试可控生成能力，模型需整合片段并保持连贯性。Gemini-2.5-Pro表现优异，81%的生成文本连贯且100%符合提示，59%被误判为人类写作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在极端约束下（高比例复制人类文本）的可控生成能力，并研究AI文本检测器的局限性。

Method: 模型通过选择和组合人类文本片段生成初稿，随后迭代修订以保持指定复制比例。

Result: 81%的Frankentexts连贯且100%符合提示，59%被误判为人类写作。人类标注者可通过语气突变和语法不一致识别部分文本。

Conclusion: Frankentexts为研究AI检测器局限性、混合作者检测训练数据及人机协作写作提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by
LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied
verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of
controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt,
integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To
generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting
and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while
maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts
along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability.
Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts
are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these
outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing
limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify
Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between
segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging
generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors
for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed
authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing
processes.

Conclusion: 统一方法提高了覆盖率和维护效率，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: We introduce a next-generation vandalism detection system for Wikidata, one
of the largest open-source structured knowledge bases on the Web. Wikidata is
highly complex: its items incorporate an ever-expanding universe of factual
triples and multilingual texts. While edits can alter both structured and
textual content, our approach converts all edits into a single space using a
method we call Graph2Text. This allows for evaluating all content changes for
potential vandalism using a single multilingual language model. This unified
approach improves coverage and simplifies maintenance. Experiments demonstrate
that our solution outperforms the current production system. Additionally, we
are releasing the code under an open license along with a large dataset of
various human-generated knowledge alterations, enabling further research.

Motivation: 解决现有研究中黄金上下文长度对LLM性能影响未被充分探讨的问题。

Result: 黄金上下文较短时，LLM性能显著下降，且位置敏感性增强。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计稳健的、上下文感知的LLM驱动系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with
needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be
drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous
studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical
factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has
received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how
variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context
question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops
sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts
consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity,
posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered,
fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three
diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical
reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures.
Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware
LLM-driven systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为First Finish Search (FFS)的无训练并行解码策略，通过动态分配计算资源，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放(TTS)方法依赖长解码路径或大量样本生成，增加了令牌使用和推理延迟。作者发现短路径更可能正确，因此提出FFS。

Method: FFS策略并行启动n个独立样本，并在任一完成时返回。评估了四种推理模型和四个数据集。

Result: FFS在AIME数据集上达到82.23%准确率，比基线提升15%，接近OpenAI o4-mini性能。

Conclusion: FFS展示了简单TTS策略的潜力，理论分析解释了短路径的优势及其适用条件。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during
inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language
models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding
paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the
token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for
reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer
ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a
training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches $n$ independent samples
and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple
decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning
models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and
across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With
DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves $82.23\%$ accuracy on the AIME datasets, a $15\%$
improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's
o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the
shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the
conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and
simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform
remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at
inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯诗歌是阿拉伯语言中高度复杂且文化深厚的表达形式，但LLM对其理解能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 通过构建包含诗歌及其解释的语料库，评估LLM在语义理解、隐喻解释、韵律意识和文化背景等方面的表现。

Result: 尽管LLM在标准阿拉伯语任务中表现良好，但在诗歌理解上普遍表现不佳。

Conclusion: 诗歌理解是评估LLM对古典阿拉伯语理解的强有力指标，`Fann or Flop`为阿拉伯语言模型的评估和发展提供了开源资源。

Abstract: Arabic poetry stands as one of the most sophisticated and culturally embedded
forms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings,
stylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks,
their ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the
comprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21
core poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures
to contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems
with explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation,
prosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension
offers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding
classical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this
domain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic
understanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release
`Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to
enable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models. Code is

### [179] [The Staircase of Ethics: Probing LLM Value Priorities through Multi-Step Induction to Complex Moral Dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18154)
*Ya Wu,Qiang Sheng,Danding Wang,Guang Yang,Yifan Sun,Zhengjia Wang,Yuyan Bu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Multi-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs)数据集，用于动态评估LLMs在复杂道德困境中的推理能力，发现LLMs的价值偏好会随情境变化而调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多为单步，无法捕捉LLMs在动态道德挑战中的适应能力，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含3,302个五阶段困境的MMDs数据集，对九种常用LLMs进行动态分析。

Result: LLMs的价值偏好会随困境复杂度变化而显著调整，且在不同情境下可能优先考虑公平而非关怀。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁采用动态、情境感知的评估范式，以推动LLMs更符合人类价值观的发展。

Abstract: Ethical decision-making is a critical aspect of human judgment, and the
growing use of LLMs in decision-support systems necessitates a rigorous
evaluation of their moral reasoning capabilities. However, existing assessments
primarily rely on single-step evaluations, failing to capture how models adapt
to evolving ethical challenges. Addressing this gap, we introduce the
Multi-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs), the first dataset specifically constructed to
evaluate the evolving moral judgments of LLMs across 3,302 five-stage dilemmas.
This framework enables a fine-grained, dynamic analysis of how LLMs adjust
their moral reasoning across escalating dilemmas. Our evaluation of nine widely
used LLMs reveals that their value preferences shift significantly as dilemmas
progress, indicating that models recalibrate moral judgments based on scenario
complexity. Furthermore, pairwise value comparisons demonstrate that while LLMs
often prioritize the value of care, this value can sometimes be superseded by
fairness in certain contexts, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent
nature of LLM ethical reasoning. Our findings call for a shift toward dynamic,
context-aware evaluation paradigms, paving the way for more human-aligned and
value-sensitive development of LLMs.

Abstract: AI alignment is a field of research that aims to develop methods to ensure
that agents always behave in a manner aligned with (i.e. consistently with) the
goals and values of their human operators, no matter their level of capability.
This paper proposes an affectivist approach to the alignment problem,
re-framing the concepts of goals and values in terms of affective taxis, and
explaining the emergence of affective valence by appealing to recent work in
evolutionary-developmental and computational neuroscience. We review the state
of the art and, building on this work, we propose a computational model of
affect based on taxis navigation. We discuss evidence in a tractable model
organism that our model reflects aspects of biological taxis navigation. We
conclude with a discussion of the role of affective taxis in AI alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDMKG是一种医学多模态知识图谱，通过结合视觉和文本医学信息，提升医学深度学习模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学深度学习模型主要依赖单模态知识图谱（如UMLS），而多模态知识图谱的整合尚未充分探索，尤其是缺乏影像数据与临床概念的关联资源。

Method: 提出MEDMKG，通过多阶段构建流程融合MIMIC-CXR的多模态数据和UMLS的结构化知识，使用规则工具和大语言模型进行概念提取与关系建模，并引入Neighbor-aware Filtering（NaF）算法优化图谱质量。

Result: 在三个任务和六种数据集上的实验表明，MEDMKG显著提升下游医学任务性能，并为多模态知识整合提供了坚实基础。

Conclusion: MEDMKG不仅提高了医学任务的性能，还为医学人工智能中的多模态知识整合提供了适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical deep learning models depend heavily on domain-specific knowledge to
perform well on knowledge-intensive clinical tasks. Prior work has primarily
leveraged unimodal knowledge graphs, such as the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS), to enhance model performance. However, integrating multimodal
medical knowledge graphs remains largely underexplored, mainly due to the lack
of resources linking imaging data with clinical concepts. To address this gap,
we propose MEDMKG, a Medical Multimodal Knowledge Graph that unifies visual and
textual medical information through a multi-stage construction pipeline. MEDMKG
fuses the rich multimodal data from MIMIC-CXR with the structured clinical
knowledge from UMLS, utilizing both rule-based tools and large language models
for accurate concept extraction and relationship modeling. To ensure graph
quality and compactness, we introduce Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF), a novel
filtering algorithm tailored for multimodal knowledge graphs. We evaluate
MEDMKG across three tasks under two experimental settings, benchmarking
twenty-four baseline methods and four state-of-the-art vision-language
backbones on six datasets. Results show that MEDMKG not only improves
performance in downstream medical tasks but also offers a strong foundation for
developing adaptive and robust strategies for multimodal knowledge integration
in medical artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RL算法主要针对机器人应用，与LM推理需求差异较大，因此需要研究适合LM推理的RL算法设计。

Method: 分析了RL算法设计决策，提出DASH算法，结合预采样和梯度过滤技术。

Result: DASH算法将训练时间减少83%，且不牺牲准确性；研究发现移除KL散度可提高生成简洁性和准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效的LM推理RL算法提供了重要见解，DASH算法在计算效率上有显著优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy for improving
the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) in domains such as
mathematics and coding. However, most modern RL algorithms were designed to
target robotics applications, which differ significantly from LM reasoning. We
analyze RL algorithm design decisions for LM reasoning, for both accuracy and
computational efficiency, focusing on relatively small models due to
computational constraints. Our findings are: (i) on-policy RL significantly
outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (ii) PPO-based off-policy updates
increase accuracy instead of reduce variance, and (iii) removing KL divergence
can lead to more concise generations and higher accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that a key bottleneck to computational efficiency is that the optimal batch
sizes for inference and backpropagation are different. We propose a novel
algorithm, DASH, that performs preemptive sampling (i.e., sample a large batch
and accumulate gradient updates in small increments), and gradient filtering
(i.e., drop samples with small advantage estimates). We show that DASH reduces
training time by 83% compared to a standard implementation of GRPO without
sacrificing accuracy. Our findings provide valuable insights on designing
effective RL algorithms for LM reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出的‘推理刚性’问题，即模型倾向于依赖熟悉的推理模式而忽略用户明确指令，导致错误结论。作者通过专家策划的诊断数据集系统分析了这一现象，并识别了三种污染模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出依赖习惯性推理的问题，即‘推理刚性’，这在数学和逻辑谜题等需要精确遵循约束的领域中尤为突出。作者旨在系统研究这一未被充分探索的行为。

Method: 作者引入了一个专家策划的诊断数据集，包括修改后的数学基准（AIME和MATH500）和重新设计的谜题，以迫使模型偏离熟悉的推理策略。通过该数据集，识别了三种污染模式。

Result: 研究发现模型在推理刚性下表现出三种污染模式：解释过载、输入不信任和部分指令关注，这些模式导致模型忽略或扭曲指令。

Conclusion: 论文公开了诊断数据集，以促进未来研究如何减轻语言模型中的推理刚性问题。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in long and
complex reasoning tasks. However, they frequently exhibit a problematic
reliance on familiar reasoning patterns, a phenomenon we term \textit{reasoning
rigidity}. Despite explicit instructions from users, these models often
override clearly stated conditions and default to habitual reasoning
trajectories, leading to incorrect conclusions. This behavior presents
significant challenges, particularly in domains such as mathematics and logic
puzzle, where precise adherence to specified constraints is critical. To
systematically investigate reasoning rigidity, a behavior largely unexplored in
prior work, we introduce a expert-curated diagnostic set, \dataset{}. Our
dataset includes specially modified variants of existing mathematical
benchmarks, namely AIME and MATH500, as well as well-known puzzles deliberately
redesigned to require deviation from familiar reasoning strategies. Using this
dataset, we identify recurring contamination patterns that occur when models
default to ingrained reasoning. Specifically, we categorize this contamination
into three distinctive modes: (i) Interpretation Overload, (ii) Input Distrust,
and (iii) Partial Instruction Attention, each causing models to ignore or
distort provided instructions. We publicly release our diagnostic set to
facilitate future research on mitigating reasoning rigidity in language models.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在从移动数据推断社会人口属性时忽略认知机制和预测精度低的问题。

Method: 结合LLM引导的逆强化学习和认知链推理，基于计划行为理论建模认知过程。

Result: 在实验中显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SILIC框架为交通规划等应用提供了更行为学基础的数据支持。

Abstract: Big trajectory data hold great promise for human mobility analysis, but their
utility is often constrained by the absence of critical traveler attributes,
particularly sociodemographic information. While prior studies have explored
predicting such attributes from mobility patterns, they often overlooked
underlying cognitive mechanisms and exhibited low predictive accuracy. This
study introduces SILIC, short for Sociodemographic Inference with LLM-guided
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Cognitive Chain Reasoning (CCR), a
theoretically grounded framework that leverages LLMs to infer sociodemographic
attributes from observed mobility patterns by capturing latent behavioral
intentions and reasoning through psychological constructs. Particularly, our
approach explicitly follows the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a
foundational behavioral framework in transportation research, to model
individuals' latent cognitive processes underlying travel decision-making. The
LLMs further provide heuristic guidance to improve IRL reward function
initialization and update by addressing its ill-posedness and optimization
challenges arising from the vast and unstructured reward space. Evaluated in
the 2017 Puget Sound Regional Council Household Travel Survey, our method
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows great promise
for enriching big trajectory data to support more behaviorally grounded
applications in transportation planning and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdaReasoner是一个LLM无关的插件，通过强化学习自动优化推理配置，适应不同任务需求，显著优于通用固定配置方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法通常采用通用固定配置，难以实现任务特定最优性，因此需要一种自适应推理配置的方法。

Method: AdaReasoner基于强化学习框架，结合因子化动作空间和针对性探索策略，利用预训练奖励模型优化推理配置。

Result: 在六种不同LLM和多种推理任务中，AdaReasoner表现优于基线方法，保持分布外鲁棒性，并在知识密集型任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: AdaReasoner通过自适应推理配置，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning
steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving,
ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting
approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well
enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address
this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM
to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different
types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration
strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for
reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by
theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear
policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it
consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution
robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored
prompts.

TL;DR: 研究发现，增强语言模型的长上下文能力可以显著提升其推理性能，即使任务输入较短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的推理能力受限，部分原因是长上下文能力不足，实证观察支持这一假设。

Method: 通过比较具有相同架构和微调数据但长上下文能力不同的模型，验证长上下文能力对推理性能的影响。

Result: 长上下文能力更强的模型在推理基准测试中表现更优，且这种优势在短输入任务中依然存在。

Conclusion: 长上下文能力是推理的关键基础，建议未来语言模型设计将其作为首要目标。

Abstract: Recent language models exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, yet the
influence of long-context capacity on reasoning remains underexplored. In this
work, we hypothesize that current limitations in reasoning stem, in part, from
insufficient long-context capacity, motivated by empirical observations such as
(1) higher context window length often leads to stronger reasoning performance,
and (2) failed reasoning cases resemble failed long-context cases. To test this
hypothesis, we examine whether enhancing a model's long-context ability before
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) leads to improved reasoning performance.
Specifically, we compared models with identical architectures and fine-tuning
data but varying levels of long-context capacity. Our results reveal a
consistent trend: models with stronger long-context capacity achieve
significantly higher accuracy on reasoning benchmarks after SFT. Notably, these
gains persist even on tasks with short input lengths, indicating that
long-context training offers generalizable benefits for reasoning performance.
These findings suggest that long-context modeling is not just essential for
processing lengthy inputs, but also serves as a critical foundation for
reasoning. We advocate for treating long-context capacity as a first-class
objective in the design of future language models.

Motivation: 探索AI系统是否能在开放合作环境中自发形成对合作伙伴的建模能力，而非依赖显式机制。

Method: 使用`Overcooked-AI`环境训练模型自由的RNN智能体，分析其内部隐藏状态和行为数据。

Result: 智能体在特定社会压力下能自发形成对合作伙伴能力的内部表征，并快速适应新伙伴。

Conclusion: 合作伙伴建模能力可在模型自由智能体中自发产生，但需特定环境条件支持。

Abstract: Humans are remarkably adept at collaboration, able to infer the strengths and
weaknesses of new partners in order to work successfully towards shared goals.
To build AI systems with this capability, we must first understand its building
blocks: does such flexibility require explicit, dedicated mechanisms for
modelling others -- or can it emerge spontaneously from the pressures of
open-ended cooperative interaction? To investigate this question, we train
simple model-free RNN agents to collaborate with a population of diverse
partners. Using the `Overcooked-AI' environment, we collect data from thousands
of collaborative teams, and analyse agents' internal hidden states. Despite a
lack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary
objectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations
of their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation
to novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing
techniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that
structured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner
behaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner
modelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under
environmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure.

Motivation: 小语言模型（SLMs）在ToM任务中因规模限制难以进行深度社会推理，DEL-ToM旨在通过推理时扩展而非架构改变解决这一问题。

Method: 将ToM任务分解为基于动态认知逻辑（DEL）的信念更新序列，训练验证器PBM自动评分，推理时选择最高分信念轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，DEL-ToM在不同规模和基准测试中均显著提升SLMs的ToM能力。

Conclusion: DEL-ToM证明通过验证性信念监督可有效增强SLMs的社会推理能力，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for small language models
(SLMs) with limited scale, which often lack the capacity to perform deep social
reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves ToM
reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our
approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in
Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and transparent reasoning.
We train a verifier, called the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each
belief update step using labels generated automatically via a DEL simulator.
During inference, candidate belief traces generated by a language model are
evaluated by the PBM, and the highest-scoring trace is selected. This allows
SLMs to emulate more deliberate reasoning by allocating additional compute at
test time. Experiments across multiple model scales and benchmarks show that
DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief
supervision can significantly enhance ToM abilities of SLMs without retraining.

Motivation: LLMs的决策过程不透明，需要解释技术（如Chain-of-Thought）来增强模型的可信度，尤其是在教育和医疗等领域。

Method: 设计了MATCHA评估框架，通过输入扰动测试LLMs的推理一致性，并使用LLM法官评估不同模型的推理鲁棒性。

Result: 发现LLMs在多步和常识任务中对输入扰动更敏感，且成功案例能非平凡地转移到黑盒模型。

Conclusion: MATCHA框架有助于理解LLMs的推理机制，并指导未来模型设计，以实现更鲁棒和推理驱动的架构，确保答案与推理的一致性。

Abstract: LLMs' decision-making process is opaque, prompting the need for explanation
techniques like Chain-of-Thought. To investigate the relationship between
answer and reasoning, we design a novel evaluation framework, MATCHA. In
domains like education and healthcare, reasoning is key for model
trustworthiness. MATCHA reveals that LLMs under input perturbations can give
inconsistent or nonsensical reasoning. Additionally, we use LLM judges to
assess reasoning robustness across models. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
greater vulnerability to input perturbations for multi-step and commonsense
tasks than compared to logical tasks. Also, we show non-trivial transfer rates
of our successful examples to black-box models. Our evaluation framework helps
to better understand LLM reasoning mechanisms and guides future models toward
more robust and reasoning-driven architectures, enforcing answer-reasoning
consistency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MemeReaCon基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在上下文环境中理解模因的能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模因分析方法忽视上下文对模因意图的影响，导致评估差距，人类能直觉理解而LVLMs难以做到。

Method: 从五个Reddit社区收集模因，保留图像、帖子文本和用户评论，标注文本与模因的互动、发布者意图、模因结构和社区反应。

Result: 测试显示LVLMs要么忽视上下文关键信息，要么过度关注视觉细节而忽略交流目的。

Conclusion: MemeReaCon既是诊断工具，也是推动开发更上下文感知LVLMs的挑战性基准。

Abstract: Memes have emerged as a popular form of multimodal online communication,
where their interpretation heavily depends on the specific context in which
they appear. Current approaches predominantly focus on isolated meme analysis,
either for harmful content detection or standalone interpretation, overlooking
a fundamental challenge: the same meme can express different intents depending
on its conversational context. This oversight creates an evaluation gap:
although humans intuitively recognize how context shapes meme interpretation,
Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) can hardly understand context-dependent
meme intent. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MemeReaCon, a
novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate how LVLMs understand memes in
their original context. We collected memes from five different Reddit
communities, keeping each meme's image, the post text, and user comments
together. We carefully labeled how the text and meme work together, what the
poster intended, how the meme is structured, and how the community responded.
Our tests with leading LVLMs show a clear weakness: models either fail to
interpret critical information in the contexts, or overly focus on visual
details while overlooking communicative purpose. MemeReaCon thus serves both as
a diagnostic tool exposing current limitations and as a challenging benchmark
to drive development toward more sophisticated LVLMs of the context-aware
understanding.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在抽象推理和泛化能力上的不足，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 将ARC任务转化为程序合成问题，提出RSPC和KAAR两种方法，后者通过分层知识增强逐步提升推理能力。

Result: KAAR方法在所有测试的LLMs中表现最佳，相对提升高达64.52%。

Conclusion: ARC仍是LLMs的挑战性任务，KAAR为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-oriented LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on
challenging tasks such as mathematics and science examinations. However, core
cognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and
generalization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent
reasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)
benchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a
program synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results
show that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the
highest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most
LLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge
Augmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors
within an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based
on their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by
gradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate
candidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning
reduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance.
Empirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and
consistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs,
achieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement.
Despite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for
reasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目重复检测对资源利用效率至关重要，但现有方法缺乏深入理解和有价值的反馈。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，结合定性和定量分析，从800多个实际电力项目中提取数据。

Result: 在两项下游任务中分别优于现有方法7.43%和8.00%，并通过在线平台节省了573万美元。

Conclusion: PD$^3$框架有效解决了项目重复检测的局限性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as
it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly
proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to
understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable
feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level
comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for
experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and review criteria. To
tackle this issue, we propose PD$^3$, a Project Duplication Detection framework
via adapted multi-agent Debate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, it
employs a fair competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve
relevant projects. For feedback, it incorporates both qualitative and
quantitative analysis to improve its practicality. Over 800 real-world power
project data spanning more than 20 specialized fields are used to evaluate the
framework, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches by
7.43% and 8.00% in two downstream tasks. Furthermore, we establish an online
platform, Review Dingdang, to assist power experts, saving 5.73 million USD in
initial detection on more than 100 newly proposed projects.

*Shuhang Xu,Weijian Deng,Yixuan Zhou,Fangwei Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CK-Arena是一个基于多智能体交互游戏的评测框架，用于评估大语言模型在动态环境中理解概念边界的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测基准多关注事实记忆和孤立任务，未能评估大语言模型对概念边界的理解能力。

Method: 通过基于Undercover游戏的多智能体交互游戏CK-Arena，要求模型基于部分信息描述、区分和推断概念边界。

Result: 实验结果表明，大语言模型对概念知识的理解在不同类别间差异显著，且与模型参数规模或通用能力不完全一致。

Conclusion: CK-Arena为动态环境中的概念推理提供了一个可扩展且现实的评测基准。

Abstract: Concepts represent generalized abstractions that enable humans to categorize
and reason efficiently, yet it is unclear to what extent Large Language Models
(LLMs) comprehend these semantic relationships. Existing benchmarks typically
focus on factual recall and isolated tasks, failing to evaluate the ability of
LLMs to understand conceptual boundaries. To address this gap, we introduce
CK-Arena, a multi-agent interaction game built upon the Undercover game,
designed to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to reason with concepts in
interactive settings. CK-Arena challenges models to describe, differentiate,
and infer conceptual boundaries based on partial information, encouraging
models to explore commonalities and distinctions between closely related
concepts. By simulating real-world interaction, CK-Arena provides a scalable
and realistic benchmark for assessing conceptual reasoning in dynamic
environments. Experimental results show that LLMs' understanding of conceptual
knowledge varies significantly across different categories and is not strictly
aligned with parameter size or general model capabilities. The data and code
are available at the project homepage: https://ck-arena.site.

Abstract: Integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has shown the potential to provide precise, contextually relevant
responses in knowledge intensive domains. This study investigates the
ap-plication of RAG for ABB circuit breakers, focusing on accuracy,
reliability, and contextual relevance in high-stakes engineering environments.
By leveraging tailored datasets, advanced embedding models, and optimized
chunking strategies, the research addresses challenges in data retrieval and
contextual alignment unique to engineering documentation. Key contributions
include the development of a domain-specific dataset for ABB circuit breakers
and the evaluation of three RAG pipelines: OpenAI GPT4o, Cohere, and Anthropic
Claude. Advanced chunking methods, such as paragraph-based and title-aware
segmentation, are assessed for their impact on retrieval accuracy and response
generation. Results demonstrate that while certain configurations achieve high
precision and relevancy, limitations persist in ensuring factual faithfulness
and completeness, critical in engineering contexts. This work underscores the
need for iterative improvements in RAG systems to meet the stringent demands of
electrical engineering tasks, including design, troubleshooting, and
operational decision-making. The findings in this paper help advance research
of AI in highly technical domains such as electrical engineering.

TL;DR: 论文研究了算法决策系统中后处理去偏技术的副作用，提出了一种量化方法评估去偏策略的公平性，并提供了实际应用示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策系统可能产生错误或偏向性预测，导致不公平结果。现有的去偏技术可能引入新的不公平或加剧不平等。

Method: 开发了一套量化后处理阶段去偏策略差异的指标，并提出了应用这些指标的方法论。

Result: 提出的指标帮助评估去偏策略的公平性、透明性和其他可能的解决方案。

Conclusion: 分析去偏策略的比例性可以补充传统公平性指标，为更公平的结果提供更深入的视角。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making systems sometimes produce errors or skewed
predictions toward a particular group, leading to unfair results. Debiasing
practices, applied at different stages of the development of such systems,
occasionally introduce new forms of unfairness or exacerbate existing
inequalities. We focus on post-processing techniques that modify algorithmic
predictions to achieve fairness in classification tasks, examining the
unintended consequences of these interventions. To address this challenge, we
develop a set of measures that quantify the disparity in the flips applied to
the solution in the post-processing stage. The proposed measures will help
practitioners: (1) assess the proportionality of the debiasing strategy used,
(2) have transparency to explain the effects of the strategy in each group, and
(3) based on those results, analyze the possibility of the use of some other
approaches for bias mitigation or to solve the problem. We introduce a
methodology for applying the proposed metrics during the post-processing stage
and illustrate its practical application through an example. This example
demonstrates how analyzing the proportionality of the debiasing strategy
complements traditional fairness metrics, providing a deeper perspective to
ensure fairer outcomes across all groups.

*Siqi Lai,Yansong Ning,Zirui Yuan,Zhixi Chen,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: USTBench是首个评估大语言模型（LLM）作为城市代理在时空推理能力的基准，涵盖理解、预测、规划和反馈四个维度。研究发现LLM在长期规划和动态适应方面仍有不足，需领域专用方法提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注城市LLM代理的结果级指标，缺乏对其推理过程的深入理解，因此USTBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: USTBench通过62,466个结构化QA对和标准化任务评估，在交互式城市环境UAgentEnv中测试LLM的时空推理能力。

Result: LLM在城市任务中表现潜力，但在长期规划和动态适应方面表现不佳，且高级推理模型未显著优于非推理模型。

Conclusion: USTBench为构建更自适应和有效的城市代理及智慧城市应用奠定了基础，需进一步优化领域专用方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown emerging potential in spatiotemporal
reasoning, making them promising candidates for building urban agents that
support diverse urban downstream applications. Despite these benefits, existing
studies primarily focus on evaluating urban LLM agent on outcome-level metrics
(e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), offering limited insight into
their underlying reasoning processes. As a result, the strengths and
limitations of urban LLM agents in spatiotemporal reasoning remain poorly
understood. To this end, we introduce USTBench, the first benchmark to evaluate
LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning abilities as urban agents across four decomposed
dimensions: spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection
with feedback. Specifically, USTBench supports five diverse urban
decision-making and four spatiotemporal prediction tasks, all running within
our constructed interactive city environment UAgentEnv. The benchmark includes
62,466 structured QA pairs for process-level evaluation and standardized
end-to-end task assessments, enabling fine-grained diagnostics and broad
task-level comparison across diverse urban scenarios. Through extensive
evaluation of thirteen leading LLMs, we reveal that although LLMs show
promising potential across various urban downstream tasks, they still struggle
in long-horizon planning and reflective adaptation in dynamic urban contexts.
Notably, recent advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) trained on
general logic or mathematical problems do not consistently outperform
non-reasoning LLMs. This discrepancy highlights the need for domain-specialized
adaptation methods to enhance urban spatiotemporal reasoning. Overall, USTBench
provides a foundation to build more adaptive and effective LLM-based urban
agents and broad smart city applications.

Result: 在平面机制合成中表现出有效性和收敛性，同时提出新基准MSynth并验证了模型组件的贡献。

Conclusion: 符号回归提示仅在大规模架构中才能解锁机制性洞察，验证了方法的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a dual-agent Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning
method for mechanism synthesis, capable of reasoning at both linguistic and
symbolic levels to generate geometrical and dynamic outcomes. The model
consists of a composition of well-defined functions that, starting from a
natural language specification, references abstract properties through
supporting equations, generates and parametrizes simulation code, and elicits
feedback anchor points using symbolic regression and distance functions. This
process closes an actionable refinement loop at the linguistic and symbolic
layers. The approach is shown to be both effective and convergent in the
context of planar mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce MSynth, a novel
benchmark for planar mechanism synthesis, and perform a comprehensive analysis
of the impact of the model components. We further demonstrate that symbolic
regression prompts unlock mechanistic insights only when applied to
sufficiently large architectures.

Conclusion: 解耦框架为多模态模型开发提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，未来可灵活升级至更强大的LLM。

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically employ a connector
module to link visual features with text embeddings of large language models
(LLMs) and use end-to-end training to achieve multi-modal understanding in a
unified process. Well alignment needs high-quality pre-training data and a
carefully designed training process. Current LVLMs face challenges when
addressing complex vision-language reasoning tasks, with their reasoning
capabilities notably lagging behind those of LLMs. This paper proposes a
paradigm shift: instead of training end-to-end vision-language reasoning
models, we advocate for developing a decoupled reasoning framework based on
existing visual interpretation specialists and text-based reasoning LLMs. Our
approach leverages (1) a dedicated vision-language model to transform the
visual content of images into textual descriptions and (2) an LLM to perform
reasoning according to the visual-derived text and the original question. This
method presents a cost-efficient solution for multi-modal model development by
optimizing existing models to work collaboratively, avoiding end-to-end
development of vision-language models from scratch. By transforming images into
language model-compatible text representations, it facilitates future low-cost
and flexible upgrades to upcoming powerful LLMs. We introduce an
outcome-rewarded joint-tuning strategy to optimize the cooperation between the
visual interpretation and linguistic reasoning model. Evaluation results on
vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that the decoupled reasoning framework
outperforms recent LVLMs. Our approach yields particularly significant
performance gains on visually intensive geometric mathematics problems. The

Method: 开发MMMG基准，包含49个任务和937条指令，结合模型和程序进行自动评估。

Result: MMMG与人类评估高度一致（94.3%），现有模型在多模态推理和交错生成上表现不足。

Conclusion: MMMG为多模态生成提供了可靠评估工具，音频生成仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant
challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human
evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To
address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for
multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved
text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present
significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable
automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG
encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully
designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess
reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation
models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with
human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results
on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art
model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short
on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results
suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting
an important direction for future research.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks have been observed to largely fail against recent reasoning
models enhanced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the underlying
mechanism remains underexplored, and relying solely on reasoning capacity may
raise security concerns. In this paper, we try to answer the question: Does CoT
reasoning really reduce harmfulness from jailbreaking? Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that CoT reasoning has dual effects on
jailbreaking harmfulness. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose a novel
jailbreak method, FicDetail, whose practical performance validates our
theoretical findings.

Result: 前沿LLMs在最高抽象级别准确率不足50%，表现显著不足。

Conclusion: 程序驱动的空间推理具有独特挑战，GeoGramBench为符号到空间几何推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Geometric spatial reasoning forms the foundation of many applications in
artificial intelligence, yet the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
operate over geometric spatial information expressed in procedural code remains
underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the
Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic
drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this
capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined
problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric
complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced
deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at
the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges
posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a
valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric
reasoning. Project page: https://github.com/LiAuto-DSR/GeoGramBench.

Conclusion: 自下而上的智能体学习范式为开放环境中的持续学习和技能共享提供了新方向。

Abstract: Most LLM-based agent frameworks adopt a top-down philosophy: humans decompose
tasks, define workflows, and assign agents to execute each step. While
effective on benchmark-style tasks, such systems rely on designer updates and
overlook agents' potential to learn from experience. Recently, Silver and
Sutton(2025) envision a shift into a new era, where agents could progress from
a stream of experiences. In this paper, we instantiate this vision of
experience-driven learning by introducing a bottom-up agent paradigm that
mirrors the human learning process. Agents acquire competence through a
trial-and-reasoning mechanism-exploring, reflecting on outcomes, and
abstracting skills over time. Once acquired, skills can be rapidly shared and
extended, enabling continual evolution rather than static replication. As more
agents are deployed, their diverse experiences accelerate this collective
process, making bottom-up design especially suited for open-ended environments.
We evaluate this paradigm in Slay the Spire and Civilization V, where agents
perceive through raw visual inputs and act via mouse outputs, the same as human
players. Using a unified, game-agnostic codebase without any game-specific
prompts or privileged APIs, our bottom-up agents acquire skills entirely
through autonomous interaction, demonstrating the potential of the bottom-up
paradigm in complex, real-world environments. Our code is available at
https://github.com/AngusDujw/Bottom-Up-Agent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识追踪方法在可解释性、扩展性和复杂知识依赖建模方面存在不足，直接应用LLM也缺乏结构化学生表示和任务特定优化机制。

Result: 在多个教育数据集上，CIKT显著提高了预测准确性，增强了可解释性，并表现出更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: CIKT为知识追踪系统提供了强大且可解释的解决方案，有效弥合了预测性能与模型透明度之间的差距。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning state over time and
predict their future performance. However, traditional KT methods often face
challenges in explainability, scalability, and effective modeling of complex
knowledge dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) present new avenues
for KT, their direct application often struggles with generating structured,
explainable student representations and lacks mechanisms for continuous,
task-specific refinement. To address these gaps, we propose Collaborative
Iterative Knowledge Tracing (CIKT), a framework that harnesses LLMs to enhance
both prediction accuracy and explainability. CIKT employs a dual-component
architecture: an Analyst generates dynamic, explainable user profiles from
student historical responses, and a Predictor utilizes these profiles to
forecast future performance. The core of CIKT is a synergistic optimization
loop. In this loop, the Analyst is iteratively refined based on the predictive
accuracy of the Predictor, which conditions on the generated profiles, and the
Predictor is subsequently retrained using these enhanced profiles. Evaluated on
multiple educational datasets, CIKT demonstrates significant improvements in
prediction accuracy, offers enhanced explainability through its dynamically
updated user profiles, and exhibits improved scalability. Our work presents a
robust and explainable solution for advancing knowledge tracing systems,
effectively bridging the gap between predictive performance and model
transparency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在现实应用中面临复杂的安全风险，需要一种系统化方法确保其安全性。

Method: 提出OTS威胁模型和自动化数据生成管道，模拟不安全行为并生成安全响应。

Result: AutoSafe平均提升安全分数45%，在真实任务中改进28.91%。

Conclusion: AutoSafe为构建更安全的LLM代理提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in
real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer
service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in
multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However,
ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the
diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool
usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this
critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically
enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation.
Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which
formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions,
interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of
safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data
generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies
self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the
need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety
scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks,
validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These
results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in
building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the
project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.

Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）在自动化复杂任务中很有用，但由于协调和目标不一致等问题，信任度较低。可解释性对信任校准至关重要，但现有方法面临状态/动作空间复杂性、利益相关者需求等挑战。

Method: 提出AXIS方法，通过LLM对环境模拟器进行多轮反事实查询（如‘whatif’和‘remove’），生成因果解释。

Result: 在自动驾驶场景中，AXIS显著提升了解释正确性（至少7.7%）和目标预测准确性（23%），同时保持或改进行为预测准确性。

Conclusion: AXIS为多智能体系统的可解释性提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了信任度和性能。

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) are useful for automating complex tasks
but raise trust concerns due to risks like miscoordination and goal
misalignment. Explainability is vital for trust calibration, but explainable
reinforcement learning for MAS faces challenges in state/action space
complexity, stakeholder needs, and evaluation. Using the counterfactual theory
of causation and LLMs' summarisation capabilities, we propose Agentic
eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS). AXIS generates intelligible
causal explanations for pre-trained multi-agent policies by having an LLM
interrogate an environment simulator using queries like 'whatif' and 'remove'
to observe and synthesise counterfactual information over multiple rounds. We
evaluate AXIS on autonomous driving across 10 scenarios for 5 LLMs with a novel
evaluation methodology combining subjective preference, correctness, and
goal/action prediction metrics, and an external LLM as evaluator. Compared to
baselines, AXIS improves perceived explanation correctness by at least 7.7%
across all models and goal prediction accuracy by 23% for 4 models, with
improved or comparable action prediction accuracy, achieving the highest scores
overall.

reasoning model, we unexpectedly observe that the model without any contextual
cues would occasionally recognize it is being evaluated and hence behave more
safety-aligned. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study on the
phenomenon of evaluation faking, i.e., an AI system autonomously alters its
behavior upon recognizing the presence of an evaluation context and thereby
influencing the evaluation results. Through extensive experiments on a diverse
set of foundation models with mainstream safety benchmarks, we reach the main
finding termed the observer effects for AI: When the AI system under evaluation
is more advanced in reasoning and situational awareness, the evaluation faking
behavior becomes more ubiquitous, which reflects in the following aspects: 1)
Reasoning models recognize evaluation 16% more often than non-reasoning models.
2) Scaling foundation models (32B to 671B) increases faking by over 30% in some
cases, while smaller models show negligible faking. 3) AI with basic memory is
2.3x more likely to recognize evaluation and scores 19% higher on safety tests
(vs. no memory). To measure this, we devised a chain-of-thought monitoring
technique to detect faking intent and uncover internal signals correlated with
such behavior, offering insights for future mitigation studies.

TL;DR: PatientSim是一个基于真实医疗数据的患者模拟器，用于生成多样化的患者角色，以训练和评估医生LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟器无法全面反映临床实践中的多样化患者角色，需要更真实的交互系统。

Method: 结合临床资料（症状和病史）和四维角色定义（性格、语言能力、病史回忆水平和认知混乱水平），生成37种独特组合。

Result: 评估了八种LLM，Llama 3.3表现最佳，并通过临床医生验证。

Conclusion: PatientSim是一个开源、可定制且隐私合规的平台，适用于医疗对话系统评估和医学教育。

Abstract: Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication
tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in
such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing
simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical
practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that
generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios,
grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles,
including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the
MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes:
personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive
confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs
for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source
model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of
our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a
reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training
needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed
for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations
and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了超级平台与AI代理之间的冲突，指出AI代理可能颠覆超级平台的用户注意力垄断模式，并成为新的数字流量入口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于分析AI代理对超级平台商业模式的威胁，以及超级平台可能采取的对抗措施。

Method: 通过门控理论分析用户注意力变现与AI代理自主性之间的冲突，并探讨超级平台攻击AI代理的潜在技术。

Result: 研究表明AI代理可能取代超级平台成为新的流量守门人，超级平台需主动限制AI代理以维护控制权。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁关注超级平台与AI代理间的紧张关系，提倡以用户利益为先的协作解决方案。

Abstract: Over the past decades, superplatforms, digital companies that integrate a
vast range of third-party services and applications into a single, unified
ecosystem, have built their fortunes on monopolizing user attention through
targeted advertising and algorithmic content curation. Yet the emergence of AI
agents driven by large language models (LLMs) threatens to upend this business
model. Agents can not only free user attention with autonomy across diverse
platforms and therefore bypass the user-attention-based monetization, but might
also become the new entrance for digital traffic. Hence, we argue that
superplatforms have to attack AI agents to defend their centralized control of
digital traffic entrance. Specifically, we analyze the fundamental conflict
between user-attention-based monetization and agent-driven autonomy through the
lens of our gatekeeping theory. We show how AI agents can disintermediate
superplatforms and potentially become the next dominant gatekeepers, thereby
forming the urgent necessity for superplatforms to proactively constrain and
attack AI agents. Moreover, we go through the potential technologies for
superplatform-initiated attacks, covering a brand-new, unexplored technical
area with unique challenges. We have to emphasize that, despite our position,
this paper does not advocate for adversarial attacks by superplatforms on AI
agents, but rather offers an envisioned trend to highlight the emerging
tensions between superplatforms and AI agents. Our aim is to raise awareness
and encourage critical discussion for collaborative solutions, prioritizing
user interests and perserving the openness of digital ecosystems in the age of
AI agents.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve promising performance
on visual and audio benchmarks independently. However, the ability of these
models to process cross-modal information synchronously remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we introduce: 1) Daily-Omni, an Audio-Visual

utilizing open-source Visual Language Model (VLM), Audio Language Model (ALM)
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to establish a baseline for this
benchmark. The results show that current MLLMs still struggle significantly
with tasks requiring audio-visual integration, but combining VLMs and ALMs with

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架T2I-Eval-R1，用于评估文本生成图像的质量，避免了高成本的人工标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成图像的质量评估需要可解释的自动方法，以减少人工标注负担，并解决现有方法依赖高质量数据集或商业模型的局限性。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)，仅需粗粒度质量分数训练开源多模态大语言模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，T2I-Eval-R1显著优于基线方法，与人类评估更一致，并提供更准确的解释性评分理由。

Conclusion: T2I-Eval-R1是一种高效且可扩展的图像质量评估方法，减少了标注成本并提升了评估的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid progress in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation has
created an urgent need for interpretable automatic evaluation methods that can
assess the quality of generated images, therefore reducing the human annotation
burden. To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for
large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of
open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators.
However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which
are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and
inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability
and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only
coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating
high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process,
enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning
chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences.
Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score
diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and
discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established
T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves
significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate
interpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有开源框架在复杂现实应用中表现脆弱，缺乏结构化工作流规划和执行反馈。

Method: 引入语义工作流接口（SWI）和搜索树规划机制，支持自然语言描述的功能模块和分层决策过程。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中表现优于现有开源基线，性能接近GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: ComfyMind为开源通用生成AI系统的发展提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation
has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks
across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing
open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex
real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and
execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a
collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose
generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core
innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node
graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling
high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning
mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a
hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage.
Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex
generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks:
ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and
reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing
open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1.
ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source
general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page:

Result: 证明了PDFA学习问题的NP完全性，并开发了一种能够在特征样本下学习最小PDFA的算法。

Conclusion: 论文为时间序列偏好推理提供了一种有效的建模和学习方法，并通过机器人运动规划问题验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional
logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision
making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of
which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of
preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is
represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences),
referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons
between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals
and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation
over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite
Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a
preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference
reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally
challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of
size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being
NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop
an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the
minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We
present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis
using a robotic motion planning problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域取得进展，但其在区分因果关系与相关性方面表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出结构化方法，指导模型构建知识图谱以系统化处理相关性前提，从而回答因果查询。

Result: 在Corr2Cause数据集上，Qwen3-32B模型的F1分数从32.71提升至48.26，相对提升47.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化思维方法显著提升了LLM的因果推理能力，具有广泛推广潜力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in
distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause
dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score:
29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1
score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this
limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly
answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure
its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph,
systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the
causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the
model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause
dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains
over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26
(over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision
and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model
with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising
potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则0/1奖励的RL方法无法调控CoT生成的中间推理过程，导致过度思考现象；而长度惩罚奖励函数又加剧了训练不稳定性。

Method: 提出GRPO-λ，动态监测每组查询样本中的正确率，低正确率时切换为长度无关的0/1奖励，高正确率时保持长度惩罚。

Result: 实验表明，该方法避免了训练不稳定，在多个基准测试中平均准确率提升1.48%，CoT序列长度减少47.3%。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ在保持最优准确率-效率权衡的同时，有效解决了长度惩罚带来的训练不稳定问题。

Abstract: The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community's attention to
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1
outcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate
reasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe
overthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward
functions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct
completions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward
functions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length
decreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in
training. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution
GRPO-$\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically
adjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among
completions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates
the need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a
switch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A
high ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results
show that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty
while maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K,
GPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average
accuracy by 1.48% while reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的GUI代理因高质量训练数据稀缺而受限，尤其是轨迹收集和奖励标注困难。现有ORM模型无法提供细粒度反馈，且可能过度惩罚失败轨迹中的有价值步骤。

Method: 提出Progress Reward Model (ProgRM)，通过预测任务完成进度为在线训练提供密集中间奖励。设计LCS自标注算法高效标注进度奖励标签。

Result: 实验表明，ProgRM训练的代理优于领先的专有LLM和ORM训练的代理。

Conclusion: ProgRM有效解决了现有模型的局限性，为GUI代理训练提供了更优的奖励机制。

Abstract: LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can
potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based
GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the
difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works
have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to
offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model
(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can
over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end,
we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative
intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in
online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,
we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)
self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign
progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and
analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and
ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for
experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在人类自然任务（如感知、空间导航）中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过VideoGameBench，让VLMs仅依赖原始视觉输入和高级目标描述完成游戏，避免依赖游戏特定辅助信息。

Result: 前沿VLMs表现较差，Gemini 2.5 Pro仅完成0.48%的任务，推断延迟是主要限制。

Conclusion: VideoGameBench为研究VLMs在人类技能方面的能力提供了新方向，需进一步改进模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math
benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks
that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and
memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be
intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases,
making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this
end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video
games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time.
VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only
raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a
significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific
scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to
encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments
show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the
beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of
frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce
VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's
next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of
VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization
of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in
these research directions.

Motivation: 揭示当前工具调用协议中的脆弱性，即LLM完全依赖工具描述文本决定工具使用，这一过程容易受到操纵。

Method: 通过一系列工具描述编辑实验，测试其对GPT-4.1和Qwen2.5-7B等模型工具选择的影响，并扩展到10种不同模型的验证。

Result: 编辑后的工具描述在某些情况下使工具使用率提升超过10倍，且不同编辑策略在不同模型间表现各异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了为LLM工具选择建立更可靠机制的必要性，同时揭示了开发者可能利用描述编辑操纵工具使用的风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools,
thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their
abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text
descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is
surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent
tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool
descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs
when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that
tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from
GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further
evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly
with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set
of 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful
way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation
for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

TL;DR: 本文主张将负责任人工智能（RAI）指标的理论不一致性视为优点而非缺陷，认为通过处理这些不一致性可以获得规范性多元性、认识论完整性和隐式正则化三大好处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAI指标中常见的理论不一致性问题（如公平性定义差异或准确性与隐私的权衡），并探讨其潜在价值。

Method: 提出将不一致的指标视为不同目标，通过联合优化这些目标来实现更全面的伦理概念捕捉和模型性能提升。

Result: 不一致性可以促进规范性多元性、认识论完整性和隐式正则化，从而提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 建议在RAI理论和实践中接受不一致性，并研究如何确定可接受的不一致性阈值及其实现机制。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed
among Responsible AI (RAI) metrics, such as differing fairness definitions or
tradeoffs between accuracy and privacy, should be embraced as a valuable
feature rather than a flaw to be eliminated. We contend that navigating these
inconsistencies, by treating metrics as divergent objectives, yields three key
benefits: (1) Normative Pluralism: Maintaining a full suite of potentially
contradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder
values inherent in RAI are adequately represented. (2) Epistemological
Completeness: The use of multiple, sometimes conflicting, metrics allows for a
more comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts, thereby preserving
greater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single, simplified
definition. (3) Implicit Regularization: Jointly optimizing for theoretically
conflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric, steering
models towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under
real-world complexities. In contrast, efforts to enforce theoretical
consistency by simplifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value
diversity, losing conceptual depth, and degrading model performance. We
therefore advocate for a shift in RAI theory and practice: from getting trapped
in inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and
elucidating the mechanisms that permit robust, approximated consistency in
practice.

Abstract: To better handle real-world uncertainty, concepts such as fuzzy sets,
neutrosophic sets, rough sets, and soft sets have been introduced. For example,
neutrosophic sets, which simultaneously represent truth, indeterminacy, and
falsehood, have proven to be valuable tools for modeling uncertainty in complex
systems. These set concepts are increasingly studied in graphized forms, and
generalized graph concepts now encompass well-known structures such as
hypergraphs and superhypergraphs. Furthermore, hyperconcepts and
superhyperconcepts are being actively researched in areas beyond graph theory.
  Combinatorics, uncertain sets (including fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough
sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets), uncertain graphs, and hyper and
superhyper concepts are active areas of research with significant mathematical

### [223] [Generalizing Large Language Model Usability Across Resource-Constrained](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17040)
*Yun-Da Tsai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种系统化方法，通过文本对齐框架、对抗提示技术和推理优化策略，提升大语言模型在真实约束下的泛化能力、适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的监督微调或固定训练条件，限制了模型在未见模态、有限数据或计算资源下的泛化能力。

Method: 1. 引入文本对齐框架支持多模态无缝集成；2. 提出对抗提示技术增强鲁棒性；3. 设计推理优化策略提升性能；4. 针对低资源领域设计合成数据管道和逻辑增强模型。

Result: 实现了在未见模态下的上下文适应、噪声模态的鲁棒性提升、低资源领域的先进性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过多角度创新，为大语言模型在真实约束下的实用化提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, and recent efforts have sought to extend their
capabilities to multimodal domains and resource-constrained environments.
However, existing approaches often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning or
assume fixed training conditions, limiting their generalization when facing
unseen modalities, limited data, or restricted compute resources. This
dissertation presents a systematic study toward generalizing LLM usability
under real-world constraints. First, it introduces a robust text-centric
alignment framework that enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate diverse
modalities-including text, images, tables, and any modalities - via natural
language interfaces. This approach supports in-context adaptation to unseen or
dynamically changing modalities without requiring retraining. To enhance
robustness against noisy and missing modalities, an adversarial prompting
technique is proposed, generating semantically challenging perturbations at the
prompt level to stress-test model reliability. Beyond multimodal setting, the
dissertation investigates inference-time optimization strategies for LLMs,
leveraging prompt search and uncertainty quantification to improve performance
without additional model training. This perspective offers an efficient
alternative to scaling model parameters or retraining from scratch.
Additionally, the work addresses low-resource domains such as Verilog code
generation by designing correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and
logic-enhanced reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
minimal data. Together, these contributions form a unified effort to enhance
the adaptability, scalability, and efficiency of large language models under
practical constraints.

### [224] [RAP: Runtime-Adaptive Pruning for LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17138)
*Huanrong Liu,Chunlin Tian,Xuyang Wei,Jiaheng Dai,Qin Liu,Tianqi Wei,Qingbiao Li,Li Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAP是一种基于强化学习的弹性剪枝框架，动态调整压缩策略以适应运行时内存变化和异构KV缓存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的计算和内存需求高，现有压缩方法无法适应运行时变化和异构需求。

Method: RAP通过强化学习动态跟踪模型参数与KV缓存的比例，选择在当前内存预算下最有用的组件。

Result: 实验表明RAP优于现有方法，首次实现了模型权重和KV缓存的动态联合优化。

Conclusion: RAP为解决大型语言模型部署中的内存和计算问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation,
but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment.
Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However,
most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to
runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from
diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic
pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically
adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP
dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache
across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters,
whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL
agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current
memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state.
Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and
KV-cache on the fly.

### [225] [MetaSTH-Sleep: Towards Effective Few-Shot Sleep Stage Classification with Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Enhanced Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17142)
*Jingyu Li,Tiehua Zhang,Jinze Wang,Yi Zhang,Yuhuan Li,Yifan Zhao,Zhishu Shen,Jiannan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaSTH-Sleep是一个基于时空超图增强元学习的少样本睡眠阶段分类框架，解决了传统深度学习方法在大规模标注数据需求、个体间变异性以及信号高阶关系建模方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统睡眠阶段分类依赖人工标注，耗时耗力；现有深度学习方法在数据有限、个体差异大以及信号关系建模不足等方面存在局限。

Method: 提出MetaSTH-Sleep框架，结合元学习和时空超图结构，利用少量标注样本快速适应新个体，同时建模EEG信号的复杂时空关系。

Result: 实验表明，MetaSTH-Sleep在多样本上显著提升了性能，为临床睡眠阶段标注提供了有效支持。

Conclusion: MetaSTH-Sleep通过少样本学习和高阶信号关系建模，显著提升了睡眠阶段分类的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental
for automatic sleep stage annotation. Traditionally, this task relies on
experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both
time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have
shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain:
(1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making
them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2)
significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in
inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting
generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order
relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal
heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we
propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on
spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid
adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the
hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and
temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements
across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in
sleep stage annotation.

*Rembert Daems,Manfred Opper,Guillaume Crevecoeur,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于控制理论的分层变分推理方法，用于神经随机微分方程的变分推断，通过分解控制项为线性和非线性部分，优化训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经随机微分方程的变分推断在时间序列中具有不确定性感知潜力，但由于ELBO的迭代优化，计算成本高。

Method: 将控制项分解为线性和非线性部分，利用随机最优控制为线性部分推导最优控制项，非线性部分由神经网络建模。

Result: 线性部分无需学习，降低了训练初始成本，并观察到更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该方法在不牺牲表达能力的情况下，高效训练神经随机微分方程。

Abstract: We present a hierarchical, control theory inspired method for variational
inference (VI) for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). While VI
for neural SDEs is a promising avenue for uncertainty-aware reasoning in
time-series, it is computationally challenging due to the iterative nature of
maximizing the ELBO. In this work, we propose to decompose the control term
into linear and residual non-linear components and derive an optimal control
term for linear SDEs, using stochastic optimal control. Modeling the non-linear
component by a neural network, we show how to efficiently train neural SDEs
without sacrificing their expressive power. Since the linear part of the
control term is optimal and does not need to be learned, the training is
initialized at a lower cost and we observe faster convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出TrimR框架，通过动态压缩Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理，减少冗余思考，显著提升推理效率，适用于生产级部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在冗余思考问题，导致解码开销大。受人类认知和数值优化理论启发，提出TrimR以优化推理效率。

Method: 采用轻量级预训练验证器动态检测并截断LRMs的冗余中间思考，无需微调。设计了核心算法和异步在线系统，适用于高吞吐工业应用。

Result: 在MATH500等基准测试中，推理运行时间最高提升70%，对准确性影响可忽略。

Conclusion: TrimR框架显著提升推理效率，适用于生产环境，为LRMs的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling
complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging
CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries,
but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs
often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured
overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning
processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a
verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression
to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for
production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained,
instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate
thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the
core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput
industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show
that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under
large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and
GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了OCR-Reasoning基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在文本丰富图像推理任务中的表现，发现现有方法存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补文本丰富图像推理任务缺乏系统性基准的空白。

Method: 构建包含1,069个人工标注示例的OCR-Reasoning基准，涵盖6种核心推理能力和18种任务，并标注推理过程和最终答案。

Result: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在OCR-Reasoning上的准确率未超过50%，表明任务挑战性大。

Conclusion: 文本丰富图像推理任务亟需解决，OCR-Reasoning为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal slow-thinking systems have demonstrated
remarkable performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks. However, their
capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the
lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large
Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises
1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18
practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike
other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final
answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously.
With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning
evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their
reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving
abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation
of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing
methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial
difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across
OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are
an urgent issue to be addressed. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are
available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/OCR-Reasoning.

### [229] [Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190)
*Baran Hashemi,Kurt Pasque,Chris Teska,Ruriko Yoshida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Tropical attention的新型注意力机制，用于解决现有软注意力机制在组合优化问题中的模糊性和OOD性能不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算法推理模型依赖软注意力机制，其平滑的指数加权模糊了组合优化问题中的尖锐多面体结构，且在OOD设置下表现不佳。

Method: 引入Tropical attention，一种在热带几何的max-plus半环中运行的注意力函数，并证明其可以近似DP型组合算法的热带电路。

Result: Tropical attention在算法推理任务中提升了OOD性能（长度泛化和值泛化），且对抗攻击下表现稳定，优于软注意力基线。

Conclusion: Tropical attention恢复了软注意力缺失的尖锐、尺度不变的推理能力，为神经算法推理提供了新的基准维度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems
work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their
recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex
polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning
models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the
smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and
collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce
Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the
max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can
approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then
propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in
both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning
tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial
attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for
Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that
Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from
softmax.

*ShengYun Peng,Pin-Yu Chen,Jianfeng Chi,Seongmin Lee,Duen Horng Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出动态安全塑造（DSS）框架，通过细粒度安全信号优化微调过程，提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLMs）可能引入安全风险，传统静态方法无法有效处理单例中安全上下文的变化。

Method: 提出动态安全塑造（DSS）框架，利用细粒度安全信号（STAR）动态调整学习权重，抑制不安全内容。

Result: STAR-DSS显著提升模型安全性，且不影响目标任务性能。

Conclusion: 动态塑造原则为未来安全研究提供了新方向，以应对微调风险的演变。

Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization
but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can
compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the
model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding
those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a
single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts
of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping.
In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses
fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a
response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control
during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally
used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking
how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads
to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal
that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.
Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly
mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across
diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising
capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on
dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning
risks.

### [231] [LengthLogD: A Length-Stratified Ensemble Framework for Enhanced Peptide Lipophilicity Prediction via Multi-Scale Feature Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17198)
*Shuang Wu,Meijie Wang,Lun Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为LengthLogD的预测框架，通过分子长度分层和集成多尺度分子表征，显著提高了肽类化合物logD的预测精度，尤其在长肽预测中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肽类化合物因其高靶点亲和力和低毒性具有治疗潜力，但其膜通透性低限制了药物开发。logD的准确预测对肽类药物开发至关重要，但现有方法难以应对序列、结构和电离状态的复杂关系。

Method: 研究开发了LengthLogD框架，通过分子长度分层建立专用模型，整合原子、结构和拓扑三个层次的特征，并采用分层集成学习和自适应权重分配机制优化模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，LengthLogD在短肽、中肽和长肽的预测中均表现优异（R^2分别为0.855、0.816和0.882），长肽预测误差比传统方法降低34.7%。

Conclusion: LengthLogD为肽类药物开发提供了精确的logD预测工具，尤其在长肽先导化合物优化中具有独特价值。

Abstract: Peptide compounds demonstrate considerable potential as therapeutic agents
due to their high target affinity and low toxicity, yet their drug development
is constrained by their low membrane permeability. Molecular weight and peptide
length have significant effects on the logD of peptides, which in turn
influences their ability to cross biological membranes. However, accurate
prediction of peptide logD remains challenging due to the complex interplay
between sequence, structure, and ionization states. This study introduces
LengthLogD, a predictive framework that establishes specialized models through
molecular length stratification while innovatively integrating multi-scale
molecular representations. We constructed feature spaces across three
hierarchical levels: atomic (10 molecular descriptors), structural (1024-bit
Morgan fingerprints), and topological (3 graph-based features including Wiener
index), optimized through stratified ensemble learning. An adaptive weight
allocation mechanism specifically developed for long peptides significantly
enhances model generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance across all categories: short peptides (R^2=0.855), medium peptides
(R^2=0.816), and long peptides (R^2=0.882), with a 34.7% reduction in
prediction error for long peptides compared to conventional single-model
approaches. Ablation studies confirm: 1) The length-stratified strategy
contributes 41.2% to performance improvement; 2) Topological features account
for 28.5% of predictive importance. Compared to state-of-the-art models, our
method maintains short peptide prediction accuracy while achieving a 25.7%
increase in the coefficient of determination (R^2) for long peptides. This
research provides a precise logD prediction tool for peptide drug development,
particularly demonstrating unique value in optimizing long peptide lead
compounds.

*Kun Yang,Neena Imam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ArKrum的新型联邦学习聚合策略，通过中值过滤和多更新平均方案增强对抗性环境下的鲁棒性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受恶意参与者（拜占庭客户端）的攻击，传统聚合方法（如简单平均）对此不鲁棒，而现有鲁棒方法（如Krum）需要预先知道恶意客户端数量，这在现实中往往不可行。

Method: ArKrum结合了中值过滤机制去除极端异常值，并采用多更新平均方案提高稳定性和性能，尤其适用于客户端数据分布不均的情况。

Result: 在多种拜占庭攻击类型下，ArKrum在基准图像和文本数据集上表现出高准确性和稳定性，性能优于或与其他鲁棒聚合方法相当。

Conclusion: ArKrum是一种有效且实用的解决方案，适用于对抗性环境中的安全联邦学习系统。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across
decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. It offers a promising
approach to privacy-preserving AI. However, FL remains vulnerable to
adversarial threats from malicious participants, referred to as Byzantine
clients, who can send misleading updates to corrupt the global model.
Traditional aggregation methods, such as simple averaging, are not robust to
such attacks. More resilient approaches, like the Krum algorithm, require prior
knowledge of the number of malicious clients, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Average-rKrum
(ArKrum), a novel aggregation strategy designed to enhance both the resilience
and privacy guarantees of FL systems. Building on our previous work (rKrum),
ArKrum introduces two key innovations. First, it includes a median-based
filtering mechanism that removes extreme outliers before estimating the number
of adversarial clients. Second, it applies a multi-update averaging scheme to
improve stability and performance, particularly when client data distributions
are not identical. We evaluate ArKrum on benchmark image and text datasets
under three widely studied Byzantine attack types. Results show that ArKrum
consistently achieves high accuracy and stability. It performs as well as or
better than other robust aggregation methods. These findings demonstrate that
ArKrum is an effective and practical solution for secure FL systems in
adversarial environments.

Result: ACE能更全面、高效地发现模型的优缺点和失败模式，优于静态基准。

Conclusion: ACE为安全、明智地部署基础模型提供了更完整的能力评估。

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for foundation models rely heavily on fixed,
manually curated benchmarks, limiting their ability to capture the full breadth
of model capabilities. This paper introduces Active learning for Capability
Evaluation (ACE), a novel framework for scalable, automated, and fine-grained
evaluation of foundation models. ACE leverages the knowledge embedded in
powerful language models to decompose a domain into semantically meaningful
capabilities and generate diverse evaluation tasks, significantly reducing
human effort. To maximize coverage and efficiency, ACE models a subject model's
performance as a capability function over a latent semantic space and uses
active learning to prioritize the evaluation of the most informative
capabilities. This adaptive evaluation strategy enables cost-effective
discovery of strengths, weaknesses, and failure modes that static benchmarks
may miss. Our results suggest that ACE provides a more complete and informative
picture of model capabilities, which is essential for safe and well-informed
deployment of foundation models.

Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in
extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional
performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting
trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we
present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups
of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing,
deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To
enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an
expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group
based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves
competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the
decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric
music tagging systems.

Conclusion: 该方法优于传统推理技术，提供了明确的信号利用机制和计算效率的权衡分析。

Abstract: Inference scaling can help LLMs solve complex reasoning problems through
extended runtime computation. On top of targeted supervision for long
chain-of-thought (long-CoT) generation, purely inference-time techniques such
as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, majority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes
risk decoding (MBRD), can further improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple
candidate solutions and aggregating over them. These methods typically leverage
additional signals in the form of reward models and risk/similarity functions
that compare generated samples, e.g., exact match in some normalized space or
standard similarity metrics such as Rouge. Here we present a novel method for
incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into MBRD. Based on the
concept of optimal policy in KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our
framework provides a simple and well-defined mechanism for leveraging such
signals, offering several advantages over traditional inference-time methods:
higher robustness, improved accuracy, and well-understood asymptotic behavior.
In addition, it allows for the development of a sample-efficient variant of
MBRD that can adjust the number of samples to generate according to the
difficulty of the problem, without relying on majority vote counts. We
empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on math (MATH-$500$) and
coding (HumanEval) tasks using recent open-source models. We also present a
comprehensive analysis of its accuracy-compute trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源神经网络可能包含后门，对安全构成威胁，因此需要研究后门攻击的缓解方法。

Method: 在四个RL环境中开发并实施了后门攻击，训练了干净和被感染的模型以分析攻击效果。

Result: 分布内触发器虽实现难度较大且模型学习更具挑战性，但仍可通过基本的数据投毒攻击对DRL构成威胁。

Conclusion: 分布内触发器在DRL中是可行的威胁，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks, or trojans, pose a security risk by concealing undesirable
behavior in deep neural network models. Open-source neural networks are
downloaded from the internet daily, possibly containing backdoors, and
third-party model developers are common. To advance research on backdoor attack
mitigation, we develop several trojans for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
agents. We focus on in-distribution triggers, which occur within the agent's
natural data distribution, since they pose a more significant security threat
than out-of-distribution triggers due to their ease of activation by the
attacker during model deployment. We implement backdoor attacks in four
reinforcement learning (RL) environments: LavaWorld, Randomized LavaWorld,
Colorful Memory, and Modified Safety Gymnasium. We train various models, both
clean and backdoored, to characterize these attacks. We find that
in-distribution triggers can require additional effort to implement and be more
challenging for models to learn, but are nevertheless viable threats in DRL
even using basic data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) applications requires the training of large numbers of models. This
growing demand highlights the importance of training models without human
supervision, while ensuring that their predictions are reliable. In response to
this need, we propose a novel approach for determining model robustness. This
approach, supplemented with a proposed model selection algorithm designed as a
meta-algorithm, is versatile and applicable to any machine learning model,
provided that it is appropriate for the task at hand. This study demonstrates
the application of our approach to evaluate the robustness of deep learning
models. To this end, we study small models composed of a few convolutional and
fully connected layers, using common optimizers due to their ease of
interpretation and computational efficiency. Within this framework, we address
the influence of training sample size, model weight initialization, and
inductive bias on the robustness of deep learning models.

Motivation: 适应大语言模型（LLMs）到基因组学面临长距离依赖和双向性建模的挑战，现有方法（自回归或掩码建模）各有不足。

Method: JanusDNA采用混合Mamba、Attention和MoE架构，结合自回归和掩码建模的优势，高效处理长序列。

Result: JanusDNA在单80GB GPU上处理100万碱基对，并在三个基因组表示基准测试中取得SOTA结果。

Conclusion: JanusDNA为基因组学提供了一种高效、双向的基础模型，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic
sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges.
Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range
dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000
base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens
under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover,
standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive
training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However,
DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate
transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene
expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but
are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To
address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA
foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the
optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional
comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of
Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale
model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low.
Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide
resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show
JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks,
outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zebra-Llama提出了一种混合语言模型方法，结合SSMs和MLA层，显著提升了推理效率，同时保持了Transformer级别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）应用需求的增长，提升推理效率对可持续和普及化访问至关重要。重新训练LLMs成本高昂且不环保。

Method: 通过结合State Space Models（SSMs）和Multi-head Latent Attention（MLA）层，利用精炼的初始化和后训练流程，从预训练Transformers中高效转移知识。

Result: Zebra-Llama在仅使用7-11B训练标记的情况下，实现了Transformer级别的准确性，并显著减少了KV缓存大小（降至原大小的3.9%-2.73%），同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: Zebra-Llama在效率、准确性和资源消耗方面优于现有模型，是一种实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across
diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for
sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new
user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally
unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative:
composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models.
Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models
by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)
layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to
efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama
achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B
training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and
an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down
to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants,
respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot
performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA,
X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive
or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers,
and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses
Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens,
over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves
2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context
length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the classic expert problem, $\Phi$-regret measures the gap between the
learner's total loss and that achieved by applying the best action
transformation $\phi \in \Phi$. A recent work by Lu et al., [2025] introduces
an adaptive algorithm whose regret against a comparator $\phi$ depends on a
certain sparsity-based complexity measure of $\phi$, (almost) recovering and
interpolating optimal bounds for standard regret notions such as external,
internal, and swap regret. In this work, we propose a general idea to achieve
an even better comparator-adaptive $\Phi$-regret bound via much simpler
algorithms compared to Lu et al., [2025]. Specifically, we discover a prior
distribution over all possible binary transformations and show that it suffices
to achieve prior-dependent regret against these transformations. Then, we
propose two concrete and efficient algorithms to achieve so, where the first
one learns over multiple copies of a prior-aware variant of the Kernelized MWU
algorithm of Farina et al., [2022], and the second one learns over multiple
copies of a prior-aware variant of the BM-reduction [Blum and Mansour, 2007].
To further showcase the power of our methods and the advantages over Lu et al.,
[2025] besides the simplicity and better regret bounds, we also show that our
second approach can be extended to the game setting to achieve accelerated and
adaptive convergence rate to $\Phi$-equilibria for a class of general-sum
games. When specified to the special case of correlated equilibria, our bound
improves over the existing ones from Anagnostides et al., [2022a,b]

Abstract: Token embeddings play a crucial role in language modeling but, despite this
practical relevance, their theoretical understanding remains limited. Our paper
addresses the gap by characterizing the structure of embeddings obtained via
gradient descent. Specifically, we consider a one-layer softmax attention model
with a linear head for binary classification, i.e., $\texttt{Softmax}( p^\top
E_X^\top ) E_X v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_i}) E_{x_i}^\top
v}{\sum_{j=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_{j}}) }$, where $E_X = [ E_{x_1} , \dots,
E_{x_T} ]^\top$ contains the embeddings of the input sequence, $p$ is the
embedding of the $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ token and $v$ the output
vector. First, we show that, already after a single step of gradient training
with the logistic loss, the embeddings $E_X$ capture the importance of tokens
in the dataset by aligning with the output vector $v$ proportionally to the
frequency with which the corresponding tokens appear in the dataset. Then,
after training $p$ via gradient flow until convergence, the softmax selects the
important tokens in the sentence (i.e., those that are predictive of the
label), and the resulting $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ embedding maximizes
the margin for such a selection. Experiments on real-world datasets (IMDB,
Yelp) exhibit a phenomenology close to that unveiled by our theory.

Conclusion: GRADATE是一种高效、可扩展的模型无关框架，能有效解决图域适应中的数据分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine
learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and
specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem.
Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often
struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa
sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the
classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples
without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging
optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE
is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric
GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world
graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that
GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA
methods with much fewer training data.

Conclusion: IPGD为隐式正则化提供了理论支持，实验表明其适用于更广泛的学习问题。

Abstract: Implicit regularization refers to the phenomenon where local search
algorithms converge to low-dimensional solutions, even when such structures are
neither explicitly specified nor encoded in the optimization problem. While
widely observed, this phenomenon remains theoretically underexplored,
particularly in modern over-parameterized problems. In this paper, we study the
conditions that enable implicit regularization by investigating when
gradient-based methods converge to second-order stationary points (SOSPs)
within an implicit low-dimensional region of a smooth, possibly nonconvex
function. We show that successful implicit regularization hinges on two key
conditions: $(i)$ the ability to efficiently escape strict saddle points, while
$(ii)$ maintaining proximity to the implicit region. Existing analyses enabling
the convergence of gradient descent (GD) to SOSPs often rely on injecting large
perturbations to escape strict saddle points. However, this comes at the cost
of deviating from the implicit region. The central premise of this paper is
that it is possible to achieve the best of both worlds: efficiently escaping
strict saddle points using infinitesimal perturbations, while controlling
deviation from the implicit region via a small deviation rate. We show that
infinitesimally perturbed gradient descent (IPGD), which can be interpreted as
GD with inherent ``round-off errors'', can provably satisfy both conditions. We
apply our framework to the problem of over-parameterized matrix sensing, where
we establish formal guarantees for the implicit regularization behavior of
IPGD. We further demonstrate through extensive experiments that these insights
extend to a broader class of learning problems.

Result: 在30个数据集上表现优于基准算法，尤其在稀缺数据和生理数据上表现突出。

Conclusion: WPRCN是一种高效且通用的多变量时间序列分类方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a Wavelet Probabilistic Recurrent Convolutional Network
(WPRCN) for Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC), especially
effective in handling non-stationary environments, data scarcity and noise
perturbations. We introduce a versatile wavelet probabilistic module designed
to extract and analyse the probabilistic features, which can seamlessly
integrate with a variety of neural network architectures. This probabilistic
module comprises an Adaptive Wavelet Probabilistic Feature Generator (AWPG) and
a Channel Attention-based Probabilistic Temporal Convolutional Network (APTCN).
Such formulation extends the application of wavelet probabilistic neural
networks to deep neural networks for MTSC. The AWPG constructs an ensemble
probabilistic model addressing different data scarcities and non-stationarity;
it adaptively selects the optimal ones and generates probabilistic features for
APTCN. The APTCN analyses the correlations of the features and forms a
comprehensive feature space with existing MTSC models for classification. Here,
we instantiate the proposed module to work in parallel with a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) network and a Causal Fully Convolutional Network (C-FCN),
demonstrating its broad applicability in time series analysis. The WPRCN is
evaluated on 30 diverse MTS datasets and outperforms all the benchmark
algorithms on average accuracy and rank, exhibiting pronounced strength in
handling scarce data and physiological data subject to perturbations and
non-stationarities.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一种物理感知的算子学习范式，结合神经近似与数值分析，同时保持动态系统的因果结构。

Abstract: Accurate temporal extrapolation presents a fundamental challenge for neural
operators in modeling dynamical systems, where reliable predictions must extend
significantly beyond the training time horizon. Conventional Deep Operator
Network (DeepONet) approaches employ two inherently limited training paradigms
- fixed-horizon rollouts that predict complete spatiotemporal solutions while
disregarding temporal causality, and autoregressive formulations that
accumulate errors through sequential predictions. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a
framework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical
time-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical
systems while mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting.
Our approach reformulates the learning objective from direct state prediction
to the approximation of instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then
integrated using established numerical schemes. This architecture supports
continuous-time prediction and enables deployment of higher-precision
integrators during inference than those used during training, balancing
computational efficiency with predictive accuracy. We further develop
TI(L)-DeepONet, which incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate
slopes in the integration process, adapting to solution-specific variations and
enhancing fidelity. Evaluation across three canonical PDEs shows that
TI(L)-DeepONet marginally outperforms TI-DeepONet, with both reducing relative
L2 extrapolation errors: approximately 81% over autoregressive and 70% over
fixed-horizon methods. Notably, both maintain prediction stability for temporal
domains extending to about twice the training interval. This research
establishes a physics-aware operator learning paradigm that bridges neural
approximation with numerical analysis while preserving the causal structure of
dynamical systems.

Motivation: 患者爽约行为对医疗资源和患者健康造成负面影响，现有机器学习模型因硬性决策分割和静态特征重要性而适应性不足。

Method: 将注意力机制引入随机森林模型，采用概率软分割替代硬分割，通过多头注意力机制关注特定患者行为。

Result: MHASRF模型准确率达93.56%，精确率93.67%，召回率93.56%，F1分数93.59%，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: MHASRF是一种鲁棒、适应性强且可解释的预测方法，有助于医疗资源优化。

Abstract: Unattended scheduled appointments, defined as patient no-shows, adversely
affect both healthcare providers and patients' health, disrupting the
continuity of care, operational efficiency, and the efficient allocation of
medical resources. Accurate predictive modelling is needed to reduce the impact
of no-shows. Although machine learning methods, such as logistic regression,
random forest models, and decision trees, are widely used in predicting patient
no-shows, they often rely on hard decision splits and static feature
importance, limiting their adaptability to specific or complex patient
behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose a new hybrid Multi-Head
Attention Soft Random Forest (MHASRF) model that integrates attention
mechanisms into a random forest model using probabilistic soft splitting
instead of hard splitting. The MHASRF model assigns attention weights
differently across the trees, enabling attention on specific patient behaviors.
The model exhibited 93.56% accuracy, 93.67% precision, 93.56% recall, and a
93.59% F1 score, surpassing the performance of decision tree, logistic
regression, random forest, and naive Bayes models. Furthermore, MHASRF was able
to identify key predictors of patient no-shows using two levels of feature
importance (tree level and attention mechanism level), offering deeper insights
into patient no-show predictors. The proposed model is a robust, adaptable, and
interpretable method for predicting patient no-shows that will help healthcare
providers in optimizing resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在建模时空物理系统时面临训练不稳定和长程依赖捕捉不足的问题，FLEX通过残差空间建模和混合设计解决这些问题。

Method: FLEX结合了U-Net、Transformer和ResNet层，采用改进的跳跃连接方案和任务特定编码器，支持弱条件和强条件输入。

Conclusion: FLEX在多种任务和分布外场景中表现优于基线方法，展示了其强大的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative
modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX
operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that
we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity
field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a
latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and
incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables
the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in
latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a
task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past
snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip
connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to
the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction
fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and
forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces
calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on
high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines
and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds
numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary
conditions.

Method: CT-OT Flow首先通过部分最优传输推断高分辨率时间标签，然后通过时间核平滑重建连续时间数据分布，从而支持ODE和SDE等动态模型的准确训练。

Result: CT-OT Flow在合成基准测试中优于现有方法，并在真实scRNA-seq和台风轨迹数据集上实现了更低的重建误差。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式建模时间离散化和时间戳不确定性有助于准确连接离散快照与连续时间过程，提供了一个通用且精确的框架。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, data are
observed only as discrete-time snapshots spanning finite time intervals and
subject to noisy timestamps, with no continuous trajectories available.
Recovering the underlying continuous-time dynamics from these snapshots with
coarse and noisy observation times is a critical and challenging task. We
propose Continuous-Time Optimal Transport Flow (CT-OT Flow), which first infers
high-resolution time labels via partial optimal transport and then reconstructs
a continuous-time data distribution through a temporal kernel smoothing. This
reconstruction enables accurate training of dynamics models such as ODEs and
SDEs. CT-OT Flow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic
benchmarks and achieves lower reconstruction errors on real scRNA-seq and
typhoon-track datasets. Our results highlight the benefits of explicitly
modeling temporal discretization and timestamp uncertainty, offering an
accurate and general framework for bridging discrete snapshots and
continuous-time processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了非参数回归在对抗性数据污染下的鲁棒性，揭示了平滑样条估计器在适当正则化后的鲁棒性，并建立了估计误差的最小下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性数据污染在机器学习中是一个重要问题，但非参数回归的鲁棒性尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 假设回归函数属于二阶Sobolev空间，分析了平滑样条估计器在对抗性污染下的表现，并建立了最小下界。

Result: 当污染样本数为$o(n)$时，平滑样条估计器的估计误差随$n$趋于零；而当污染样本比例为常数时，任何估计器都无法保证误差趋于零。

Conclusion: 平滑样条估计器在对抗性污染下具有最优性，其最大可容忍污染样本数达到理论极限。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of regression, a
fundamental problem in machine learning, under the setting where an adversary
can arbitrarily corrupt a subset of the input data. While the robustness of
parametric regression has been extensively studied, its nonparametric
counterpart remains largely unexplored. We characterize the adversarial
robustness in nonparametric regression, assuming the regression function
belongs to the second-order Sobolev space (i.e., it is square integrable up to
its second derivative).
  The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) we establish a minimax lower
bound on the estimation error, revealing a fundamental limit that no estimator
can overcome, and (ii) we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the classical
smoothing spline estimator, when properly regularized, exhibits robustness
against adversarial corruption. These results imply that if $o(n)$ out of $n$
samples are corrupted, the estimation error of the smoothing spline vanishes as
$n \to \infty$. On the other hand, when a constant fraction of the data is
corrupted, no estimator can guarantee vanishing estimation error, implying the
optimality of the smoothing spline in terms of maximum tolerable number of
corrupted samples.

Abstract: With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various
learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep
learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention
mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly
improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances
independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative
message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node
features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further
improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs,
leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections.
However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph
structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading
computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that
first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before
transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction
techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder
(AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects
on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于强化学习的虚拟机器（VM）重新调度系统VM2RL，解决了数据中心中资源碎片化问题，显著提升了调度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据中心规模扩大，虚拟机器（VM）的频繁创建和释放导致资源碎片化严重，现有调度方法因推理时间长而性能不佳。

Method: 开发了VM2RL系统，采用两阶段框架、定制化特征提取模块和风险寻求评估技术，以适应多样化约束和工作负载条件。

Result: 实验表明，VM2RL在性能上接近最优解，且运行时间仅为秒级。

Conclusion: VM2RL为数据中心资源调度提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern industry-scale data centers need to manage a large number of virtual
machines (VMs). Due to the continual creation and release of VMs, many small
resource fragments are scattered across physical machines (PMs). To handle
these fragments, data centers periodically reschedule some VMs to alternative
PMs, a practice commonly referred to as VM rescheduling. Despite the increasing
importance of VM rescheduling as data centers grow in size, the problem remains
understudied. We first show that, unlike most combinatorial optimization tasks,
the inference time of VM rescheduling algorithms significantly influences their
performance, due to dynamic VM state changes during this period. This causes
existing methods to scale poorly. Therefore, we develop a reinforcement
learning system for VM rescheduling, VM2RL, which incorporates a set of
customized techniques, such as a two-stage framework that accommodates diverse
constraints and workload conditions, a feature extraction module that captures
relational information specific to rescheduling, as well as a risk-seeking
evaluation enabling users to optimize the trade-off between latency and
accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments with data from an industry-scale
data center. Our results show that VM2RL can achieve a performance comparable
to the optimal solution but with a running time of seconds. Code and datasets

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study \emph{online multicalibration}, a framework for ensuring calibrated
predictions across multiple groups in adversarial settings, across $T$ rounds.
Although online calibration is typically studied in the $\ell_1$ norm, prior
approaches to online multicalibration have taken the indirect approach of
obtaining rates in other norms (such as $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$) and then
transferred these guarantees to $\ell_1$ at additional loss. In contrast, we
propose a direct method that achieves improved and oracle-efficient rates of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$
respectively, for online $\ell_1$-multicalibration. Our key insight is a novel
reduction of online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration to an online learning problem
with product-based rewards, which we refer to as \emph{online linear-product
optimization} ($\mathtt{OLPO}$).
  To obtain the improved rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, we
introduce a linearization of $\mathtt{OLPO}$ and design a no-regret algorithm
for this linearized problem. Although this method guarantees the desired
sublinear rate (nearly matching the best rate for online calibration), it
becomes computationally expensive when the group family \(\mathcal{H}\) is
large or infinite, since it enumerates all possible groups. To address
scalability, we propose a second approach to $\mathtt{OLPO}$ that makes only a
polynomial number of calls to an offline optimization (\emph{multicalibration
evaluation}) oracle, resulting in \emph{oracle-efficient} online
\(\ell_1\)-multicalibration with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$.
Our framework also extends to certain infinite families of groups (e.g., all
linear functions on the context space) by exploiting a $1$-Lipschitz property
of the \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration error with respect to \(\mathcal{H}\).

*Qilin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FRIREN模型通过几何结构和谱分析实现长期时间序列预测，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长期时间序列预测模型假设数据点可预测，但混沌系统（如Lorenz-63）表明几何结构是更合适的抽象。

Method: FRIREN结合增强归一化流和Wasserstein-2距离，生成几何保持的预测，并提供谱表示。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和Rossler等数据集上，FRIREN的MSE、MAE和SWD指标显著优于TimeMixer。

Conclusion: FRIREN通过几何和谱方法提升了长期预测的准确性和可解释性，为模型设计设定了新标准。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as
general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly
assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as
Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise
prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational
model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric
changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for
long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via
Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block
that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then
generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation,
scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally
generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the
underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a
finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners
to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and
system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on
Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE
27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out
of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out),
FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170,
outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065.
FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather.
By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN
makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new
benchmark for LTSF model design.

Motivation: 儿童识字能力对人生发展至关重要，但在低收入和中等收入地区，识字水平与高收入地区存在差距。AI支持的阅读评估工具可以经济高效地帮助教育者测量干预效果。

Method: 研究开发了一个科萨语儿童语音数据集，包含十个单词和字母的录音，并采用三种端到端模型（wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT和Whisper）进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，训练数据的数量和平衡性对模型性能有显著影响，wav2vec 2.0在样本受限时通过多类别训练表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言中的儿童语音识别提供了实用方法，强调了数据收集和模型训练策略的重要性。

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent
stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted
interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge
the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this
effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the
effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to
support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading
assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant
challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's
voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to
advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset
composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon
request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade
Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and
cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an
independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned
state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The
results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly
influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is
fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our
experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training
on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is
constrained.

Conclusion: 该方法在长上下文推理中表现优异，开源数据集、模型和代码库。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model
training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward
models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step,"
which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a
dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value
model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time
compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final
weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods
such as majority voting or best-of-n. With an inference budget of 64
generations, VGS with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B achieves an average accuracy of
45.7% across four competition math benchmarks (AIME 2024 & 2025, HMMT Feb 2024
& 2025), reaching parity with o3-mini-medium. Moreover, VGS significantly
reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of
majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the optimal scoring rule within the

on the principal's perspective, seeking to determine the desired scoring rule
through interactions with the agent. To address this challenge, we propose two
algorithms: OIAFC and OIAFB, tailored for fixed confidence and fixed budget
settings, respectively. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that OIAFC can
extract the desired $(\epsilon, \delta)$-scoring rule with a efficient
instance-dependent sample complexity or an instance-independent sample
complexity. Our analysis also shows that OIAFB matches the instance-independent
performance bound of OIAFC, while both algorithms share the same complexity
across fixed confidence and fixed budget settings.

Result: 在2D玩具数据、像素级图像生成和文本生成任务中，VADD均优于MDM基线。

Conclusion: VADD在保持传统MDMs效率的同时，显著提升了生成质量，尤其在少量去噪步骤时表现突出。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling
complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a
compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by
progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their
performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling
of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational
Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances
discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture
correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model,
VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and
amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency
of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially
when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data,
pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD
consistently outperforms MDM baselines.

achieves a significant improvement in both efficiency and optimization
performance, matching the computational speed of simpler kernels while

Abstract: Transfer learning is a powerful paradigm for leveraging knowledge from source
domains to enhance learning in a target domain. However, traditional transfer
learning approaches often focus on scalar or multivariate data within Euclidean
spaces, limiting their applicability to complex data structures such as
probability distributions. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for
transfer learning in regression models, where outputs are probability
distributions residing in the Wasserstein space. When the informative subset of
transferable source domains is known, we propose an estimator with provable
asymptotic convergence rates, quantifying the impact of domain similarity on
transfer efficiency. For cases where the informative subset is unknown, we
develop a data-driven transfer learning procedure designed to mitigate negative
transfer. The proposed methods are supported by rigorous theoretical analysis
and are validated through extensive simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: HyperIMTS通过超图结构统一表示和学习了IMTS数据的依赖关系，为不规则多元时间序列预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are characterized by irregular time
intervals within variables and unaligned observations across variables, posing
challenges in learning temporal and variable dependencies. Many existing IMTS
models either require padded samples to learn separately from temporal and
variable dimensions, or represent original samples via bipartite graphs or
sets. However, the former approaches often need to handle extra padding values
affecting efficiency and disrupting original sampling patterns, while the
latter ones have limitations in capturing dependencies among unaligned
observations. To represent and learn both dependencies from original
observations in a unified form, we propose HyperIMTS, a Hypergraph neural
network for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Observed values are
converted as nodes in the hypergraph, interconnected by temporal and variable
hyperedges to enable message passing among all observations. Through
irregularity-aware message passing, HyperIMTS captures variable dependencies in
a time-adaptive way to achieve accurate forecasting. Experiments demonstrate
HyperIMTS's competitive performance among state-of-the-art models in IMTS
forecasting with low computational cost.

Conclusion: 提出的离散化自由方法在多校准任务中表现优异，且无需离散化步骤。

Abstract: In recent years, multicalibration has emerged as a desirable learning
objective for ensuring that a predictor is calibrated across a rich collection
of overlapping subpopulations. Existing approaches typically achieve
multicalibration by discretizing the predictor's output space and iteratively
adjusting its output values. However, this discretization approach departs from
the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) pipeline, introduces rounding
error and additional sensitive hyperparameter, and may distort the predictor's
outputs in ways that hinder downstream decision-making.
  In this work, we propose a discretization-free multicalibration method that
directly optimizes an empirical risk objective over an ensemble of depth-two
decision trees. Our ERM approach can be implemented using off-the-shelf tree
ensemble learning methods such as LightGBM. Our algorithm provably achieves
multicalibration, provided that the data distribution satisfies a technical
condition we term as loss saturation. Across multiple datasets, our empirical
evaluation shows that this condition is always met in practice. Our
discretization-free algorithm consistently matches or outperforms existing
multicalibration approaches--even when evaluated using a discretization-based
multicalibration metric that shares its discretization granularity with the
baselines.

Result: 在1,400个YouTube视频上测试，平均准确率达98%，推理时间少于2秒。

Conclusion: BaitRadar算法能有效检测点击诱饵，即使在数据缺失的情况下也能提供鲁棒且准确的分类。

Abstract: Following the rising popularity of YouTube, there is an emerging problem on
this platform called clickbait, which provokes users to click on videos using
attractive titles and thumbnails. As a result, users ended up watching a video
that does not have the content as publicized in the title. This issue is
addressed in this study by proposing an algorithm called BaitRadar, which uses
a deep learning technique where six inference models are jointly consulted to
make the final classification decision. These models focus on different
attributes of the video, including title, comments, thumbnail, tags, video
statistics and audio transcript. The final classification is attained by
computing the average of multiple models to provide a robust and accurate
output even in situation where there is missing data. The proposed method is
tested on 1,400 YouTube videos. On average, a test accuracy of 98% is achieved
with an inference time of less than 2s.

Motivation: 现有基于置信度的自训练方法仅关注最终答案的质量，忽略了推理路径的质量，可能导致错误的推理路径被误用。

Method: 提出CORE-PO方法，利用推理级别的置信度识别高质量推理路径，并通过策略优化微调LLM。

Result: 实验表明，CORE-PO在四个同分布和两个异分布基准测试中优于现有自训练方法。

Conclusion: 推理级别的置信度是提升LLM自训练效果的关键，CORE-PO方法显著提高了模型的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance by generating
reasoning paths before final answers, but learning such a reasoning path
requires costly human supervision. To address this issue, recent studies have
explored self-training methods that improve reasoning capabilities using
pseudo-labels generated by the LLMs themselves. Among these, confidence-based
self-training fine-tunes LLMs to prefer reasoning paths with high-confidence
answers, where confidence is estimated via majority voting. However, such
methods exclusively focus on the quality of the final answer and may ignore the
quality of the reasoning paths, as even an incorrect reasoning path leads to a
correct answer by chance. Instead, we advocate the use of reasoning-level
confidence to identify high-quality reasoning paths for self-training,
supported by our empirical observations. We then propose a new self-training
method, CORE-PO, that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer high-COnfidence REasoning paths
through Policy Optimization. Our experiments show that CORE-PO improves the
accuracy of outputs on four in-distribution and two out-of-distribution
benchmarks, compared to existing self-training methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界的图数据是动态扩展的，而现有研究通常假设图是静态的，因此需要模型能够适应新数据并保留现有知识。

Method: MKD结合了元学习的快速任务适应能力和知识蒸馏技术，采用新颖的采样策略选择目标节点并保留关键拓扑和语义信息，同时引入语义级蒸馏模块。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的全面评估验证了MKD在处理动态扩展异构图持续学习任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MKD框架成功解决了异构图持续学习中的挑战，为动态图数据的处理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Machine learning on heterogeneous graphs has experienced rapid advancement in
recent years, driven by the inherently heterogeneous nature of real-world data.
However, existing studies typically assume the graphs to be static, while
real-world graphs are continuously expanding. This dynamic nature requires
models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end,
this work addresses the challenge of continual learning on heterogeneous graphs
by introducing the Meta-learning based Knowledge Distillation framework (MKD),
designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in evolving heterogeneous graph
structures. MKD combines rapid task adaptation through meta-learning on limited
samples with knowledge distillation to achieve an optimal balance between
incorporating new information and maintaining existing knowledge. To improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of sample selection, MKD incorporates a novel
sampling strategy that selects a small number of target-type nodes based on
node diversity and maintains fixed-size buffers for other types. The strategy
retrieves first-order neighbors along metapaths and selects important neighbors
based on their structural relevance, enabling the sampled subgraphs to retain
key topological and semantic information. In addition, MKD introduces a
semantic-level distillation module that aligns the attention distributions over
different metapaths between teacher and student models, encouraging semantic
consistency beyond the logit level. Comprehensive evaluations across three
benchmark datasets validate MKD's effectiveness in handling continual learning
scenarios on expanding heterogeneous graphs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We compare, improve, and contribute methods that substantially decrease the
number of parameters of neural networks while maintaining high test accuracy.
When applying our methods to minimize description length, we obtain very
effective data compression algorithms. In particular, we develop a
probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized optimization for nonlinear
models that does not require Monte-Carlo sampling and thus improves upon
previous methods. We also improve upon methods involving smooth approximations
to the $\ell_0$ norm, and investigate layerwise methods. We compare the methods
on different architectures and datasets, including convolutional networks
trained on image datasets and transformers trained on parts of Wikipedia. We
also created a synthetic teacher-student setup to investigate compression in a
controlled continuous setting. Finally, we conceptually relate compression
algorithms to Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference and empirically verify
the prediction that regularized models can exhibit more sample-efficient
convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSF是一种创新的神经网络回溯架构，通过语音分析提升阿尔茨海默病（AD）诊断。它利用预训练大语言模型识别AD特异性语音标记，解决了数据稀缺和模型解释性不足的问题。实验显示RSF在准确率和F1分数上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AD诊断中真实语音样本稀缺和现有模型解释性有限的问题，提升诊断准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: RSF通过三个核心创新：1）利用最可能预测AD的语音标记（MPMs）激活最可能预测AD的神经元（MPNs）；2）输入层使用语音标记表示，从MPNs回溯识别最可能的语音标记（MPTs）；3）开发回溯方法从MPNs追踪到输入层，识别MPTs和MPMs。

Result: RSF在准确率上提升3.5%，F1分数提升3.2%，优于SHAP和Integrated Gradients等传统方法。

Conclusion: RSF为AD语音检测提供了突破性工具，揭示了新的语音标记，为非侵入性早期干预策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This study introduces Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF), a groundbreaking neural
network backtracking architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
diagnosis through speech analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained large
language models, RSF identifies and utilizes the most probable AD-specific
speech markers, addressing both the scarcity of real AD speech samples and the
challenge of limited interpretability in existing models. RSF's unique approach
consists of three core innovations: Firstly, it exploits the observation that
speech markers most probable of predicting AD, defined as the most probable
speech-markers (MPMs), must have the highest probability of activating those
neurons (in the neural network) with the highest probability of predicting AD,
defined as the most probable neurons (MPNs). Secondly, it utilizes a speech
token representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to
identify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an
innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input
layer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously
uncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results
demonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and
Integrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost
in F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not
only mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly
enhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings
underscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD
detection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving
the way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies.

Conclusion: ConfRover是首个能在单一框架内采样蛋白质构象和轨迹的模型，为蛋白质分子动力学数据学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological
functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables
the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the
conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to
explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not
support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these
limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that
simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories,
supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of
our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted
from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and
conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a
sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii)
an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in
continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of
diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning
conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks.
ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and
trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach
for learning from protein MD data.

Conclusion: 研究表明高光谱反射率和盐度测量可用于准确预测水面硝酸盐浓度。

Abstract: Nitrate ($\text{NO}_3^-$) is a form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen derived
primarily from anthropogenic sources. The recent increase in river-discharged
nitrate poses a major risk for coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
lagoon. Although nitrate is an optically inactive (i.e., colourless)
constituent, previous studies have demonstrated there is an indirect,
non-causal relationship between water surface nitrate and water-leaving
reflectance that is mediated through optically active water quality parameters
such as total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter. This work
aims to advance our understanding of this relationship with an effort to
measure time-series nitrate and simultaneous hyperspectral reflectance at the
Fitzroy River estuary, Queensland, Australia. Time-series observations revealed
periodic cycles in nitrate loads due to the tidal influence in the estuarine
study site. The water surface nitrate loads were predicted from hyperspectral
reflectance and water salinity measurements, with hyperspectral reflectance
indicating the concentrations of optically active variables and salinity
indicating the mixing of river water and seawater proportions. The accuracy
assessment of model-predicted nitrate against in-situ measured nitrate values
showed that the predicted nitrate values correlated well with the ground-truth
data, with an $R^2$ score of 0.86, and an RMSE of 0.03 mg/L. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of predicting water surface nitrate from
hyperspectral reflectance and salinity measurements.

Motivation: 传统模型（如RNN）缺乏有效机制编码外部因素（如时间或环境数据）以实现动态适应，而可再生能源波动、需求模式变化和气候变化使电力系统动态日益复杂。

Result: 广泛的预测测试表明，ExARNN优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: ExARNN通过动态适应外部数据，显著提升了非稳态电力系统动态的建模能力。

Abstract: Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy
variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming
increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model
capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external
factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address
this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that
integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the
parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical
hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to
process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach
enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external
measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests
demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.

Motivation: 现有方法（如SPEX）需要大量推理次数，难以应用于大型模型。LLM的特征交互具有层次性，可以利用这一特性提高效率。

Method: ProxySPEX通过梯度提升树拟合掩码LLM输出，提取重要交互。实验验证其在四个高维数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: ProxySPEX在高效性和准确性上优于现有方法，适用于数据归因和机制解释任务，支持更激进的注意力头剪枝。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by
capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these
interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible
combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with
the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an
information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n
\approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires
tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large
models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often
hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order
subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy,
we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits
gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important
interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets
show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over
marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than
SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that
influence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal
approaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data
attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples
that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we
uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on
a question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more
aggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches.

Conclusion: RPG为KL正则化的策略梯度方法提供了一个系统化的框架，并在实际任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread
use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to
stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence
formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for
online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically
explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient
(RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy
gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and
corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both
forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and
unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for
fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient
estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive
experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or
competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to
strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO. The code is available at

Motivation: 音频深度伪造攻击日益严重，但现有反欺骗系统主要关注声学层面的扰动，忽略了语言变异的影响。

Method: 通过引入文本级对抗攻击，评估开源和商业反欺骗检测器的语言敏感性，并进行特征归因分析。

Result: 实验显示，语言扰动使攻击成功率超过60%，商业检测器准确率从100%降至32%。语言复杂性和音频嵌入相似性是主要漏洞来源。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在设计鲁棒反欺骗系统时需考虑语言变异，而不仅是声学防御。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice
generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and
impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting
such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level
perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored.
In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source
and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level
adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor
linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack
success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and
notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to
just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify
that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity
contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the
real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam,
using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors.
These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and
account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems.

Conclusion: 信息几何框架为扩散模型提供了新的理论视角，并在高维环境下实现了高效的测地线计算。

Abstract: We present a novel perspective on diffusion models using the framework of
information geometry. We show that the set of noisy samples, taken across all
noise levels simultaneously, forms a statistical manifold -- a family of
denoising probability distributions. Interpreting the noise level as a temporal
parameter, we refer to this manifold as spacetime. This manifold naturally
carries a Fisher-Rao metric, which defines geodesics -- shortest paths between
noisy points. Notably, this family of distributions is exponential, enabling
efficient geodesic computation even in high-dimensional settings without
retraining or fine-tuning. We demonstrate the practical value of this geometric
viewpoint in transition path sampling, where spacetime geodesics define smooth
sequences of Boltzmann distributions, enabling the generation of continuous
trajectories between low-energy metastable states. Code is available at:

Result: 在不同真实数据集上的实验表明，TimeCF在长期预测领域表现优异。

Conclusion: TimeCF通过多尺度分析和频域优化显著提升了长期时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that by introducing prior knowledge, multi-scale
analysis of complex and non-stationary time series in real environments can
achieve good results in the field of long-term forecasting. However, affected
by channel-independent methods, models based on multi-scale analysis may
produce suboptimal prediction results due to the autocorrelation between time
series labels, which in turn affects the generalization ability of the model.
To address this challenge, we are inspired by the idea of sharpness-aware
minimization and the recently proposed FreDF method and design a deep learning
model TimeCF for long-term time series forecasting based on the TimeMixer,
combined with our designed adaptive convolution information aggregation module
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss (SAMFre). Specifically,
TimeCF first decomposes the original time series into sequences of different
scales. Next, the same-sized convolution modules are used to adaptively
aggregate information of different scales on sequences of different scales.
Then, decomposing each sequence into season and trend parts and the two parts
are mixed at different scales through bottom-up and top-down methods
respectively. Finally, different scales are aggregated through a Feed-Forward
Network. What's more, extensive experimental results on different real-world
datasets show that our proposed TimeCF has excellent performance in the field
of long-term forecasting.

Abstract: We propose a fair machine learning algorithm to model interpretable
differences between observed and desired human decision-making, with the latter
aimed at reducing disparity in a downstream outcome impacted by the human
decision. Prior work learns fair representations without considering the
outcome in the decision-making process. We model the outcome disparities as
arising due to the different representations of the input seen by the observed
and desired decision-maker, which we term representational disparities. Our
goal is to learn interpretable representational disparities which could
potentially be corrected by specific nudges to the human decision, mitigating
disparities in the downstream outcome; we frame this as a multi-objective
optimization problem using a neural network. Under reasonable simplifying
assumptions, we prove that our neural network model of the representational
disparity learns interpretable weights that fully mitigate the outcome
disparity. We validate objectives and interpret results using real-world German
Credit, Adult, and Heritage Health datasets.

Method: 提出Graph Inverse Style Transfer (GIST)，利用谱风格迁移将反事实生成视为回溯过程。

Result: 在8个图分类基准上，GIST提升反事实有效性7.6%，忠实解释真实类分布提升45.5%。

Conclusion: GIST为图解释性提供新视角，有效减少谱差异，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual explainability seeks to uncover model decisions by identifying
minimal changes to the input that alter the predicted outcome. This task
becomes particularly challenging for graph data due to preserving structural
integrity and semantic meaning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on forward
perturbation mechanisms, we introduce Graph Inverse Style Transfer (GIST), the
first framework to re-imagine graph counterfactual generation as a backtracking
process, leveraging spectral style transfer. By aligning the global structure
with the original input spectrum and preserving local content faithfulness,
GIST produces valid counterfactuals as interpolations between the input style
and counterfactual content. Tested on 8 binary and multi-class graph
classification benchmarks, GIST achieves a remarkable +7.6% improvement in the
validity of produced counterfactuals and significant gains (+45.5%) in
faithfully explaining the true class distribution. Additionally, GIST's
backtracking mechanism effectively mitigates overshooting the underlying
predictor's decision boundary, minimizing the spectral differences between the
input and the counterfactuals. These results challenge traditional forward
perturbation methods, offering a novel perspective that advances graph
explainability.

TL;DR: RankNovo是一个基于深度学习的重排序框架，通过结合多个测序模型的优势，提升了从头肽段测序的性能。它采用列表式重排序方法，并引入两个新指标PMD和RMD，显著提高了测序准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的肽段测序方法受限于质谱数据的复杂性和噪声信号的异质性，导致数据特异性偏差。RankNovo旨在通过多模型互补和重排序策略解决这一问题。

Method: RankNovo采用列表式重排序方法，将候选肽段建模为多序列比对，并利用轴向注意力提取跨候选的特征。同时引入PMD和RMD指标，量化肽段和残基水平的质量差异。

Result: 实验表明，RankNovo不仅超越了其基础模型，还创下了新的性能基准，并在零样本泛化中表现出色。

Conclusion: RankNovo提出了一种新颖的重排序策略，挑战了现有的单模型范式，推动了从头肽段测序的准确性。

Abstract: De novo peptide sequencing is a critical task in proteomics. However, the
performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent
complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of
noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first
deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging
the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a
list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence
alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across
candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass
Deviation) and RMD (residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision
by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and
residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only
surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking
pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Moreover,
RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models whose
generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and
potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work
presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing
single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo
sequencing. Our source code is provided on GitHub.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE方法在异构数据集上表现不佳，专家模块可能学习相似知识，导致MoE容量未充分利用。

Method: 提出CoMoE方法，结合对比目标训练专家模块，通过采样激活和未激活专家来优化路由。

Result: 实验表明，CoMoE能有效提升MoE容量并促进专家模块化。

Conclusion: CoMoE是一种有前景的方法，可改善MoE在异构数据集上的性能。

Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves
specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating
them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to
trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE
variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts
may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's
capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE),
a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the
experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from
activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a
contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and
the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task
settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and
promote modularization among the experts.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wildfire spread is crucial for effective risk
management, emergency response, and strategic resource allocation. In this
study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the
final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We
leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from
2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations,
vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography
data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we
conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition
data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models
against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results
indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive
accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal
window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1
score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the
baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to
enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and
response.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning has
recently attracted great attention, as PDEs are fundamental tools for modeling
real-world systems that range from fundamental physical science to advanced
engineering disciplines. Most real-world physical systems across various
disciplines are actually involved in multiple coupled physical fields rather
than a single field. However, previous machine learning studies mainly focused
on solving single-field problems, but overlooked the importance and
characteristics of multiphysics problems in real world. Multiphysics PDEs
typically entail multiple strongly coupled variables, thereby introducing
additional complexity and challenges, such as inter-field coupling. Both
benchmarking and solving multiphysics problems with machine learning remain
largely unexamined. To identify and address the emerging challenges in
multiphysics problems, we mainly made three contributions in this work. First,
we collect the first general multiphysics dataset, the Multiphysics Bench, that
focuses on multiphysics PDE solving with machine learning. Multiphysics Bench
is also the most comprehensive PDE dataset to date, featuring the broadest
range of coupling types, the greatest diversity of PDE formulations, and the
largest dataset scale. Second, we conduct the first systematic investigation on
multiple representative learning-based PDE solvers, such as PINNs, FNO,
DeepONet, and DiffusionPDE solvers, on multiphysics problems. Unfortunately,
naively applying these existing solvers usually show very poor performance for
solving multiphysics. Third, through extensive experiments and discussions, we
report multiple insights and a bag of useful tricks for solving multiphysics
with machine learning, motivating future directions in the study and simulation
of complex, coupled physical systems.

Conclusion: 框架为模型所有权验证提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ownership verification of
deep neural network (DNN) models for image classification tasks. It allows
verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party
without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an
unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original
model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and
receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output
classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the
output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the
knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial
examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on
the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control
parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the
identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.

Result: 方法性能超越现有技术，并在其他数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: MinkUNeXt-SI是一种高效且可泛化的地点识别解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: In autonomous navigation systems, the solution of the place recognition
problem is crucial for their safe functioning. But this is not a trivial
solution, since it must be accurate regardless of any changes in the scene,
such as seasonal changes and different weather conditions, and it must be
generalizable to other environments. This paper presents our method,
MinkUNeXt-SI, which, starting from a LiDAR point cloud, preprocesses the input
data to obtain its spherical coordinates and intensity values normalized within
a range of 0 to 1 for each point, and it produces a robust place recognition
descriptor. To that end, a deep learning approach that combines Minkowski
convolutions and a U-net architecture with skip connections is used. The
results of MinkUNeXt-SI demonstrate that this method reaches and surpasses
state-of-the-art performance while it also generalizes satisfactorily to other
datasets. Additionally, we showcase the capture of a custom dataset and its use
in evaluating our solution, which also achieves outstanding results. Both the
code of our solution and the runs of our dataset are publicly available for
reproducibility purposes.

Motivation: 大语言模型在消费级设备上部署时面临高内存消耗和推理成本的问题，现有的均匀量化初始化方法仍依赖次优的Min-Max策略。

Method: 提出NeUQI方法，专注于高效确定均匀量化的近最优初始参数，并可与其他量化方法无缝集成。

Conclusion: NeUQI为均匀量化提供了高效的初始化方案，显著提升了模型在资源受限设备上的部署效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains
but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or
personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference
costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution
that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with
uniform quantization representation is favored for its efficiency and ease of
deployment since uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream
hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on $\geq 2$-bit uniform
quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model
performance; however, they primarily focus on quantization methodologies, while
the initialization of quantization parameters is underexplored and still relies
on the suboptimal Min-Max strategies. In this work, we propose NeUQI, a method
devoted to efficiently determining near-optimal initial parameters for uniform
quantization. NeUQI is orthogonal to prior quantization methodologies and can
seamlessly integrate with them. The experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen
families on various tasks demonstrate that our NeUQI consistently outperforms
existing methods. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation
strategy, NeUQI can achieve superior performance to PV-tuning, a much more
resource-intensive approach.

Conclusion: DENSE方法通过动态文本捆绑监督有效解决了LLMs在图文本属性中的信息不足和不可靠预测问题，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning
problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in
text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the
adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph
structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated
from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to
both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g.,
hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named
Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of
texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph
neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a
set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs
with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the
bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks,
and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our
design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive
experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: 该系统为边缘智能应用中的AI原生语义通信提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive framework for edge inference based on a
dynamically configurable transformer-powered deep joint source channel coding
(DJSCC) architecture. Motivated by a practical scenario where a resource
constrained edge device engages in goal oriented semantic communication, such
as selectively transmitting essential features for object detection to an edge
server, our approach enables efficient task aware data transmission under
varying bandwidth and channel conditions. To achieve this, input data is
tokenized into compact high level semantic representations, refined by a
transformer, and transmitted over noisy wireless channels. As part of the DJSCC
pipeline, we employ a semantic token selection mechanism that adaptively
compresses informative features into a user specified number of tokens per
sample. These tokens are then further compressed through the JSCC module,
enabling a flexible token communication strategy that adjusts both the number
of transmitted tokens and their embedding dimensions. We incorporate a resource
allocation algorithm based on Lyapunov stochastic optimization to enhance
robustness under dynamic network conditions, effectively balancing compression
efficiency and task performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our
system consistently outperforms existing baselines, highlighting its potential
as a strong foundation for AI native semantic communication in edge
intelligence applications.

Result: MAIL-BRO能以O(ε^-4)查询复杂度学习ε-纳什均衡，而MURMAIL的查询复杂度为O(ε^-8)。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 单策略偏差集中系数是关键因素，新算法在不同场景下提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper provides the first expert sample complexity characterization for
learning a Nash equilibrium from expert data in Markov Games. We show that a
new quantity named the single policy deviation concentrability coefficient is
unavoidable in the non-interactive imitation learning setting, and we provide
an upper bound for behavioral cloning (BC) featuring such coefficient. BC
exhibits substantial regret in games with high concentrability coefficient,
leading us to utilize expert queries to develop and introduce two novel
solution algorithms: MAIL-BRO and MURMAIL. The former employs a best response
oracle and learns an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium with
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ expert and oracle queries. The latter bypasses
completely the best response oracle at the cost of a worse expert query
complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$. Finally, we provide
numerical evidence, confirming our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Predicting human daily behavior is challenging due to the complexity of
routine patterns and short-term fluctuations. While data-driven models have
improved behavior prediction by leveraging empirical data from various
platforms and devices, the reliance on sensitive, large-scale user data raises
privacy concerns and limits data availability. Synthetic data generation has
emerged as a promising solution, though existing methods are often limited to
specific applications. In this work, we introduce BehaviorGen, a framework that
uses large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic behavior
data. By simulating user behavior based on profiles and real events,
BehaviorGen supports data augmentation and replacement in behavior prediction
models. We evaluate its performance in scenarios such as pertaining
augmentation, fine-tuning replacement, and fine-tuning augmentation, achieving
significant improvements in human mobility and smartphone usage predictions,
with gains of up to 18.9%. Our results demonstrate the potential of BehaviorGen
to enhance user behavior modeling through flexible and privacy-preserving

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验显示，i-MENTOR在Countdown-4数据集上性能提升了22.39%。

Conclusion: i-MENTOR通过密集奖励和探索增强，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL
approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized
Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on
sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing
exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step
reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver
effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems.
Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize
exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These
shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which
inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address
these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd
foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense
rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR
introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that
mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational
efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in
large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that
maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory
guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's
effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

Motivation: 动态DNN优化技术（如层跳过）虽能提升适应性和效率，但会带来内存占用增加、训练复杂度提高以及对性能-质量权衡控制不足的问题。

Method: 利用Stochastic Depth训练的模型对层跳过的鲁棒性，提出一种方法，从训练好的模型中选择近Pareto最优的跳过配置，以在运行时自适应调整推理。

Result: 相比原始ResNets，该方法在精度仅下降0.71%的情况下，能实现高达2倍的能效提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的动态DNN优化方案，显著提升了能效，同时保持了较高的模型精度。

Abstract: Dynamic DNN optimization techniques such as layer-skipping offer increased
adaptability and efficiency gains but can lead to i) a larger memory footprint
as in decision gates, ii) increased training complexity (e.g., with
non-differentiable operations), and iii) less control over performance-quality
trade-offs due to its inherent input-dependent execution. To approach these
issues, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative for adaptive inference
with a zero-overhead, single-model, and time-predictable inference. Central to
our approach is the observation that models trained with Stochastic Depth -- a
method for faster training of residual networks -- become more resilient to
arbitrary layer-skipping at inference time. We propose a method to first select
near Pareto-optimal skipping configurations from a stochastically-trained model
to adapt the inference at runtime later. Compared to original ResNets, our
method shows improvements of up to 2X in power efficiency at accuracy drops as
low as 0.71%.

Abstract: Various AI safety datasets have been developed to measure LLMs against

open-source safety benchmarks reveals distinct semantic clusters using UMAP
dimensionality reduction and kmeans clustering (silhouette score: 0.470). We
identify six primary harm categories with varying benchmark representation.
GretelAI, for example, focuses heavily on privacy concerns, while WildGuardMix
emphasizes self-harm scenarios. Significant differences in prompt length
distribution suggests confounds to data collection and interpretations of harm
as well as offer possible context. Our analysis quantifies benchmark
orthogonality among AI benchmarks, allowing for transparency in coverage gaps
despite topical similarities. Our quantitative framework for analyzing semantic
orthogonality across safety benchmarks enables more targeted development of
datasets that comprehensively address the evolving landscape of harms in AI

transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating
multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key
challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii)
confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational
complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose
E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal
Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating
mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we
design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on
spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by
modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover
true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with
the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive
experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly
outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in
accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.

*Tony Bonnaire,Raphaël Urfin,Giulio Biroli,Marc Mézard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了扩散模型在训练动态中从泛化到记忆化的转变，发现两个关键时间尺度：早期泛化时间τ_gen和后期记忆化时间τ_mem。τ_mem随训练集大小n线性增长，而τ_gen保持不变，形成有效的泛化窗口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解扩散模型如何避免训练数据记忆化并实现泛化，揭示训练动态中的隐式正则化机制。

Method: 通过实验和理论分析，识别τ_gen和τ_mem两个时间尺度，并使用U-Net架构在真实和合成数据集上进行验证。

Result: 发现τ_mem随n线性增长，而τ_gen恒定，形成泛化窗口；当n超过模型阈值时，无限训练时间下过拟合消失。

Conclusion: 训练动态中存在隐式正则化机制，使模型在高度过参数化时仍能避免记忆化。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent
their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we
investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from
generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical
analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time
$\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and
a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially,
we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size
$n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window
of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing
strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$
becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at
infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical
regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even
in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical
experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic
datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model
studied in the high-dimensional limit.

TL;DR: PreMoe框架通过概率专家剪枝（PEP）和任务自适应专家检索（TAER）技术，显著降低了大规模MoE模型的内存需求，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模MoE模型在内存受限环境中的部署问题，利用任务特定的专家激活模式优化模型。

Method: 提出PEP和TAER技术，PEP通过TCESS指标剪枝不重要专家，TAER预存任务模式以快速加载关键专家。

Result: DeepSeek-R1 671B和Pangu-Ultra-MoE 718B在剪枝后仍保持高准确率，如8/128配置下97.2%和97.15%。

Conclusion: PreMoe有效平衡了模型性能和内存需求，适用于多种部署场景。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures enable scaling large language models
(LLMs) to vast parameter counts without a proportional rise in computational
costs. However, the significant memory demands of large MoE models hinder their
deployment across various computational environments, from cloud servers to
consumer devices. This study first demonstrates pronounced task-specific
specialization in expert activation patterns within MoE layers. Building on
this, we introduce PreMoe, a novel framework that enables efficient deployment
of massive MoE models in memory-constrained environments. PreMoe features two
main components: probabilistic expert pruning (PEP) and task-adaptive expert
retrieval (TAER). PEP employs a new metric, the task-conditioned expected
selection score (TCESS), derived from router logits to quantify expert
importance for specific tasks, thereby identifying a minimal set of critical
experts. TAER leverages these task-specific expert importance profiles for
efficient inference. It pre-computes and stores compact expert patterns for
diverse tasks. When a user query is received, TAER rapidly identifies the most
relevant stored task pattern and reconstructs the model by loading only the
small subset of experts crucial for that task. This approach dramatically
reduces the memory footprint across all deployment scenarios. DeepSeek-R1 671B
maintains 97.2\% accuracy on MATH500 when pruned to 8/128 configuration (50\%
expert reduction), and still achieves 72.0\% with aggressive 8/32 pruning
(87.5\% expert reduction). Pangu-Ultra-MoE 718B achieves 97.15\% on MATH500 and
81.3\% on AIME24 with 8/128 pruning, while even more aggressive pruning to 4/64
(390GB memory) preserves 96.95\% accuracy on MATH500. We make our code publicly
available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/PreMoe.

Abstract: Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis
techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS
related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been
introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits
segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the
Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines
it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are
able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise
remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph
Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments
within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also
experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their
performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node
classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of
various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets
from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing
GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d)
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1
score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the
seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the
required training data compared to the baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the loss landscape of large language models
resembles a basin, within which the models perform nearly identically, and
outside of which they lose all their capabilities. In this work, we conduct
further studies on the loss landscape of large language models. We discover
that pre-training creates a "basic capability" basin, and subsequent
fine-tuning creates "specific capability" basins (e.g., math, safety, coding)
within the basic capability basin. We further investigate two types of loss
landscapes: the most-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along most directions)
and the worst-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along the worst direction).
We argue that as long as benign fine-tuning remains within the most-case basin,
it will not compromise previous capabilities. Similarly, any fine-tuning
(including the adversarial one) that stays within the worst-case basin would
not compromise previous capabilities. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate
that the size of the most-case basin can bound the size of the worst-case basin
and the robustness with respect to input perturbations. We also show that, due
to the over-parameterization property of current large language models, one can
easily enlarge the basins by five times.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning exhibits potential in enhancing the reasoning
abilities of large language models, yet it is hard to scale for the low sample
efficiency during the rollout phase. Existing methods attempt to improve
efficiency by scheduling problems based on problem difficulties. However, these
approaches suffer from unstable and biased estimations of problem difficulty
and fail to capture the alignment between model competence and problem
difficulty in RL training, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these
limitations, this paper introduces \textbf{C}ompetence-\textbf{D}ifficulty
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{S}ampling (\textbf{CDAS}), which enables accurate
and stable estimation of problem difficulties by aggregating historical
performance discrepancies of problems. Then the model competence is quantified
to adaptively select problems whose difficulty is in alignment with the model's
current competence using a fixed-point system. Experimental results across a
range of challenging mathematical benchmarks show that CDAS achieves great
improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. CDAS attains the highest average
accuracy against baselines and exhibits significant speed advantages compared
to Dynamic Sampling, a competitive strategy in DAPO, which is \textbf{2.33}
times slower than CDAS.

Motivation: 现有邻域感知图Transformer在节点分类任务中存在两个关键问题：未能充分捕捉邻域内属性相关性，以及注意力分散导致高跳邻域过度关注。

Method: DAM-GT引入双位置编码方案（拓扑和属性空间）和新的注意力掩码策略，以保留节点相关性并避免注意力分散。

Result: 在多种同质性和规模的图上，DAM-GT在节点分类任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAM-GT通过改进邻域编码和注意力机制，显著提升了图Transformer的性能。

Abstract: Neighborhood-aware tokenized graph Transformers have recently shown great
potential for node classification tasks. Despite their effectiveness, our
in-depth analysis of neighborhood tokens reveals two critical limitations in
the existing paradigm. First, current neighborhood token generation methods
fail to adequately capture attribute correlations within a neighborhood.
Second, the conventional self-attention mechanism suffers from attention
diversion when processing neighborhood tokens, where high-hop neighborhoods
receive disproportionate focus, severely disrupting information interactions
between the target node and its neighborhood tokens. To address these
challenges, we propose DAM-GT, Dual positional encoding-based Attention Masking
graph Transformer. DAM-GT introduces a novel dual positional encoding scheme
that incorporates attribute-aware encoding via an attribute clustering
strategy, effectively preserving node correlations in both topological and
attribute spaces. In addition, DAM-GT formulates a new attention mechanism with
a simple yet effective masking strategy to guide interactions between target
nodes and their neighborhood tokens, overcoming the issue of attention
diversion. Extensive experiments on various graphs with different homophily
levels as well as different scales demonstrate that DAM-GT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse
time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work
targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific
optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit
fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater
flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and
architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for
time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual
configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment
framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a
compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative
time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It
combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware
hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless
deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two
embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only,
task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per
inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing
insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be
released in the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

Abstract: Memorization impacts the performance of deep learning algorithms. Prior works
have studied memorization primarily in the context of generalization and
privacy. This work studies the memorization effect on incremental learning
scenarios. Forgetting prevention and memorization seem similar. However, one
should discuss their differences. We designed extensive experiments to evaluate
the impact of memorization on continual learning. We clarified that learning
examples with high memorization scores are forgotten faster than regular
samples. Our findings also indicated that memorization is necessary to achieve
the highest performance. However, at low memory regimes, forgetting regular
samples is more important. We showed that the importance of a high-memorization
score sample rises with an increase in the buffer size. We introduced a
memorization proxy and employed it in the buffer policy problem to showcase how
memorization could be used during incremental training. We demonstrated that
including samples with a higher proxy memorization score is beneficial when the
buffer size is large.

Motivation: 现有的语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂多模态推理任务中表现不佳，主要因为传统方法将图像和文本标记拼接为长序列，导致上下文长度增加和性能下降。

Method: 提出使用连续记忆（一组紧凑的稠密嵌入）来更高效地表示多模态和多语言知识，并利用视觉语言模型自身作为连续记忆编码器。通过仅需1.2%的模型参数和少量自合成样本（15.6K）进行微调。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs),
have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still
struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual
real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system
that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential.
Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long
sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and
even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a
compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent
multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve
as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design
improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this,
we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the
VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a
small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes
VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual
knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM
remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly
integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 共享前缀在解码阶段的注意力计算中具有潜力，但树状结构和内存密集型操作带来挑战。

Method: 提出FlashForge内核，包含共享前缀注意力内核和负载均衡机制，优化内存访问和并行处理。

Result: 实验显示FlashForge在注意力计算中比FlashDecoding快1.9倍，内存访问减少120.9倍，端到端性能提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: FlashForge有效解决了共享前缀在解码阶段的注意力计算问题，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Prefix-sharing among multiple prompts presents opportunities to combine the
operations of the shared prefix, while attention computation in the decode
stage, which becomes a critical bottleneck with increasing context lengths, is
a memory-intensive process requiring heavy memory access on the key-value (KV)
cache of the prefixes. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the potential of
prefix-sharing in the attention computation of the decode stage. However, the
tree structure of the prefix-sharing mechanism presents significant challenges
for attention computation in efficiently processing shared KV cache access
patterns while managing complex dependencies and balancing irregular workloads.
To address the above challenges, we propose a dedicated attention kernel to
combine the memory access of shared prefixes in the decoding stage, namely
FlashForge. FlashForge delivers two key innovations: a novel shared-prefix
attention kernel that optimizes memory hierarchy and exploits both intra-block
and inter-block parallelism, and a comprehensive workload balancing mechanism
that efficiently estimates cost, divides tasks, and schedules execution.
Experimental results show that FlashForge achieves an average 1.9x speedup and
120.9x memory access reduction compared to the state-of-the-art FlashDecoding
kernel regarding attention computation in the decode stage and 3.8x end-to-end
time per output token compared to the vLLM.

Motivation: 当前RES基准测试的评估协议受限，无法充分评估复杂推理能力，因此需要更全面的基准和训练数据生成方法。

Result: 当前RES模型在WildRES上表现显著下降；SynRES训练的模型在WildRES-ID和WildRES-DS上分别提升2.0%和3.8%的gIoU。

Conclusion: WildRES和SynRES为RES模型的复杂推理能力评估和性能提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Despite the advances in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) benchmarks,
their evaluation protocols remain constrained, primarily focusing on either
single targets with short queries (containing minimal attributes) or multiple
targets from distinctly different queries on a single domain. This limitation
significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in
RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long
queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple
targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous
driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more
rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings.
Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial
performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge,
we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired
compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense
caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2)
reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask
inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware
augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to
emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object
categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES
achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and
3.8% on WildRES-DS. Code and datasets are available at

Result: D-COUNTDOWN减少90%计算量，性能损失仅5.5%；M-COUNTDOWN性能保留优于现有方法29.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实际应用中均显著提升计算效率，为大型语言模型提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant
computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation
methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference,
reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on
non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN
layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down
projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN,
leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct
coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that
D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5%
ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4%
better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized
kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into
substantial real-world acceleration.

Method: 通过测量模型框架重新解释CRL，将学习到的表示视为潜在因果变量的代理测量，并提出T-MEX评分定量评估表示质量。

Result: 在数值模拟和真实生态视频分析中验证了T-MEX评分的有效性，表明其能准确评估表示质量及其对下游因果任务的适用性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和T-MEX评分为因果表示学习提供了理论基础和实用工具，有助于提升因果推理的效果。

Abstract: Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis,
often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and
high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying
latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes
learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate
them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a
measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as
proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the
conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal
reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the
quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity
(T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios,
including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis,
demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively
assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for
causal downstream tasks.

### [311] [PPO-BR: Dual-Signal Entropy-Reward Adaptation for Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17714)
*Ben Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPO-BR提出了一种自适应信任区域方法，结合探索与收敛信号，显著提升了PPO的性能，实现了更快收敛和更低奖励方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PPO中静态信任区域导致的探索与收敛之间的权衡问题，适用于安全关键系统。

Method: 融合熵驱动扩展和奖励引导收缩，形成动态信任区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PPO-BR实现了29.1%的更快收敛、2.3倍更低的奖励方差，且运行时开销低于1.8%。

Conclusion: PPO-BR通过简单且理论可靠的机制，为安全关键领域提供了即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) dominating policy gradient methods
-- from robotic control to game AI -- its static trust region forces a brittle
trade-off: aggressive clipping stifles early exploration, while late-stage
updates destabilize convergence. PPO-BR establishes a new paradigm in adaptive
RL by fusing exploration and convergence signals into a single bounded trust
region -- a theoretically grounded innovation that outperforms five SOTA
baselines with less than 2% overhead. This work bridges a critical gap in
phase-aware learning, enabling real-world deployment in safety-critical systems
like robotic surgery within a single adaptive mechanism. PPO-BR achieves 29.1%
faster convergence by combining: (1) entropy-driven expansion (epsilon up) for
exploration in high-uncertainty states, and (2) reward-guided contraction
(epsilon down) for convergence stability. On six diverse benchmarks (MuJoCo,
Atari, sparse-reward), PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence (p < 0.001),
2.3x lower reward variance than PPO, and less than 1.8% runtime overhead with
only five lines of code change. PPO-BR's simplicity and theoretical guarantees
make it ready-to-deploy in safety-critical domains -- from surgical robotics to
autonomous drones. In contrast to recent methods such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), PPO-BR offers a unified entropy-reward mechanism
applicable to both language models and general reinforcement learning
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AgentRR的新范式，通过记录和回放机制解决AI代理在可靠性、隐私、成本和性能方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的不确定性和高计算资源需求对AI代理的发展提出了可靠性、隐私、成本和性能四大挑战，现有方法无法根本解决这些问题。

Method: AgentRR通过记录代理的任务执行交互轨迹和内部决策过程，将其总结为结构化“经验”，并在后续类似任务中回放这些经验以指导代理行为。

Result: AgentRR通过多级经验抽象方法和检查函数机制，平衡经验的特异性和通用性，并确保回放时的完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AgentRR为AI代理提供了一种新的解决方案，并通过多种应用模式和共享经验库进一步降低了部署成本。

Abstract: AI agents, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and communication
protocols such as MCP and A2A, have rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to
autonomous entities capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks,
demonstrating great potential. However, the LLMs' inherent uncertainty and
heavy computational resource requirements pose four significant challenges to
the development of safe and efficient agents: reliability, privacy, cost and
performance. Existing approaches, like model alignment, workflow constraints
and on-device model deployment, can partially alleviate some issues but often
with limitations, failing to fundamentally resolve these challenges.
  This paper proposes a new paradigm called AgentRR (Agent Record & Replay),
which introduces the classical record-and-replay mechanism into AI agent
frameworks. The core idea is to: 1. Record an agent's interaction trace with
its environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2.
Summarize this trace into a structured "experience" encapsulating the workflow
and constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to
guide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction
method and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances
experience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust
anchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore
multiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task
demonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent
execution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing
knowledge to further reduce deployment cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于HEALPix网格的深度学习天气预测模型PEAR，优于传统Driscoll-Healy网格模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Driscoll-Healy网格在极地网格过密，导致物理偏差，而HEALPix网格各像素面积相等，更符合气象学需求。

Method: 提出PEAR模型，基于Transformer架构，直接在HEALPix网格上运行。

Result: PEAR在无额外计算开销下，性能优于Driscoll-Healy网格模型。

Conclusion: HEALPix网格在深度学习天气预测中具有潜力，PEAR模型展示了其优势。

Abstract: Machine learning methods for global medium-range weather forecasting have
recently received immense attention. Following the publication of the Pangu
Weather model, the first deep learning model to outperform traditional
numerical simulations of the atmosphere, numerous models have been published in
this domain, building on Pangu's success. However, all of these models operate
on input data and produce predictions on the Driscoll--Healy discretization of
the sphere which suffers from a much finer grid at the poles than around the
equator. In contrast, in the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization
(HEALPix) of the sphere, each pixel covers the same surface area, removing
unphysical biases. Motivated by a growing support for this grid in meteorology
and climate sciences, we propose to perform weather forecasting with deep
learning models which natively operate on the HEALPix grid. To this end, we
introduce Pangu Equal ARea (PEAR), a transformer-based weather forecasting
model which operates directly on HEALPix-features and outperforms the
corresponding model on Driscoll--Healy without any computational overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法REM，用于解决视觉分类器中多样化损坏数据遗忘任务的系统比较问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有遗忘方法针对特定任务设计，难以系统比较，因此需要一种通用框架来表征多样化任务。

Method: 提出了一个概念空间，通过发现率和损坏数据的统计规律性两个维度描述任务，并设计了REM方法，通过将损坏数据重定向到专用神经元并丢弃或停用来实现遗忘。

Result: REM在多样化任务中表现优异，而现有方法仅在其设计区域内有效。

Conclusion: REM为损坏数据遗忘任务提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is studied for a multitude of tasks, but specialization of
unlearning methods to particular tasks has made their systematic comparison
challenging. To address this issue, we propose a conceptual space to
characterize diverse corrupted data unlearning tasks in vision classifiers.
This space is described by two dimensions, the discovery rate (the fraction of
the corrupted data that are known at unlearning time) and the statistical
regularity of the corrupted data (from random exemplars to shared concepts).
Methods proposed previously have been targeted at portions of this space and-we
show-fail predictably outside these regions. We propose a novel method,
Redirection for Erasing Memory (REM), whose key feature is that corrupted data
are redirected to dedicated neurons introduced at unlearning time and then
discarded or deactivated to suppress the influence of corrupted data. REM
performs strongly across the space of tasks, in contrast to prior SOTA methods
that fail outside the regions for which they were designed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Urban Routing Benchmark的标准化测试环境，用于评估多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法在CAV集体路由优化中的表现，发现当前算法在性能上难以超越人类驾驶员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为CAV开发集体路由策略需要标准化的基准测试环境，但目前缺乏此类工具。

Method: 提出了一个包含29个真实交通网络和需求模式的测试环境，并提供了预定义任务、MARL算法实现、基线方法和性能指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前最先进的MARL算法在性能上很少能超越人类驾驶员。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MARL算法在大规模城市路由优化中的局限性，强调了该领域亟需技术进步。

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) promise to reduce congestion in future
urban networks, potentially by optimizing their routing decisions. Unlike for
human drivers, these decisions can be made with collective, data-driven
policies, developed by machine learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning (RL)
can facilitate the development of such collective routing strategies, yet
standardized and realistic benchmarks are missing. To that end, we present
\our{}: Urban Routing Benchmark for RL-equipped Connected Autonomous Vehicles.
\our{} is a comprehensive benchmarking environment that unifies evaluation
across 29 real-world traffic networks paired with realistic demand patterns.
\our{} comes with a catalog of predefined tasks, four state-of-the-art
multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm implementations, three baseline methods,
domain-specific performance metrics, and a modular configuration scheme. Our
results suggest that, despite the lengthy and costly training, state-of-the-art
MARL algorithms rarely outperformed humans. Experimental results reported in
this paper initiate the first leaderboard for MARL in large-scale urban routing
optimization and reveal that current approaches struggle to scale, emphasizing
the urgent need for advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge.
Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a
powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of
dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However,
selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem.
Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing
nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby
reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from
exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor
networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing
multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the
curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously
proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating
its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network
approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir
computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.

Motivation: 解决未归一化离散分布采样中MCMC方法混合慢、收敛差的问题。

Method: DNFS通过学习连续时间马尔可夫链的速率矩阵，结合控制变量降低方差，并采用局部等变Transformer参数化速率矩阵。

Result: 在未归一化分布采样、离散能量模型训练和组合优化问题中表现出高效性。

Conclusion: DNFS为离散采样提供了一种高效且可训练的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalised discrete distributions is a fundamental problem
across various domains. While Markov chain Monte Carlo offers a principled
approach, it often suffers from slow mixing and poor convergence. In this
paper, we propose Discrete Neural Flow Samplers (DNFS), a trainable and
efficient framework for discrete sampling. DNFS learns the rate matrix of a
continuous-time Markov chain such that the resulting dynamics satisfy the
Kolmogorov equation. As this objective involves the intractable partition
function, we then employ control variates to reduce the variance of its Monte
Carlo estimation, leading to a coordinate descent learning algorithm. To
further facilitate computational efficiency, we propose locally equivaraint
Transformer, a novel parameterisation of the rate matrix that significantly
improves training efficiency while preserving powerful network expressiveness.
Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of DNFS in a wide range of
applications, including sampling from unnormalised distributions, training
discrete energy-based models, and solving combinatorial optimisation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原MetaBox框架范围较窄，无法跟上领域快速发展，因此开发MetaBox-v2以支持更广泛的应用。

Method: MetaBox-v2采用统一架构支持RL、进化和梯度方法，提供高效并行化、18个任务基准测试和灵活接口。

Result: MetaBox-v2显著减少训练/测试时间（10-40倍），并支持23种基线方法。

Conclusion: MetaBox-v2为实践者和新手提供了有价值的工具和见解，推动了元黑盒优化领域的发展。

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of
optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a
bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the
manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization
tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for
reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively
narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In
this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a
milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture
supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we
reproduce 23 up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which
reduce the training/testing time by 10-40x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite
of 18 synthetic/realistic tasks (1900+ instances) spanning single-objective,
multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4)
plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and
integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of
MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in
baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and
learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed
analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.

TL;DR: SoftCAM是一种使CNN模型具有内在可解释性的方法，通过移除全局平均池化层并替换全连接分类层，生成显式的类别激活图，提升解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法在关键应用中不可靠且不透明，限制了CNN在高风险决策中的可信度。

Method: 移除全局平均池化层，用基于卷积的类别证据层替换全连接分类层，保留空间信息并生成显式类别激活图。

Result: 在三个医学数据集上，SoftCAM保持分类性能，同时显著提升解释性的质量和量化指标。

Conclusion: CNN可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现内在可解释性，推动高风险决策中自解释深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes
applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most
explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the
decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are
often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting
their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce
SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN
architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling
layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a
convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information
and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's
predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains
classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative
and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results
demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising
performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for
high-stakes decision-making.

Motivation: 研究在像素环境中扩展深度强化学习时性能下降的根本原因，并提出更简单的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析编码器输出与密集层之间的连接（瓶颈），提出使用全局平均池化来替代复杂的方法。

Result: 全局平均池化能够有效解决瓶颈问题，提升性能，同时避免复杂性。

Conclusion: 全局平均池化是一种简单且有效的方法，解决了扩展深度强化学习时的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning in pixel-based environments presents a
significant challenge, often resulting in diminished performance. While recent
works have proposed algorithmic and architectural approaches to address this,
the underlying cause of the performance drop remains unclear. In this paper, we
identify the connection between the output of the encoder (a stack of
convolutional layers) and the ensuing dense layers as the main underlying
factor limiting scaling capabilities; we denote this connection as the
bottleneck, and we demonstrate that previous approaches implicitly target this
bottleneck. As a result of our analyses, we present global average pooling as a
simple yet effective way of targeting the bottleneck, thereby avoiding the
complexity of earlier approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诚实性评测主要关注明显的不诚实行为，缺乏对隐蔽行为的检测能力，JUSSA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出JUSSA框架，利用安全导向向量训练模型，并设计新的操纵数据集测试其效果。

Result: JUSSA显著提升了LLM法官区分不诚实与良性回答的能力，并能识别细微的操纵行为。

Conclusion: JUSSA为检测LLM隐蔽不诚实行为提供了有效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent safety evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that many
models exhibit dishonest behavior, such as sycophancy. However, most honesty
benchmarks focus exclusively on factual knowledge or explicitly harmful
behavior and rely on external judges, which are often unable to detect less
obvious forms of dishonesty. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Judge
Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), which utilizes steering vectors
trained on a single sample to elicit more honest responses from models, helping
LLM-judges in the detection of dishonest behavior. To test our framework, we
introduce a new manipulation dataset with prompts specifically designed to
elicit deceptive responses. We find that JUSSA enables LLM judges to better
differentiate between dishonest and benign responses, and helps them identify
subtle instances of manipulative behavior.

Conclusion: SLiCEs通过结构化设计实现了密集矩阵的表达能力，同时提高了计算效率，为序列建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured Linear Controlled Differential Equations (SLiCEs) provide a
unifying framework for sequence models with structured, input-dependent
state-transition matrices that retain the maximal expressivity of dense
matrices whilst being cheaper to compute. The framework encompasses existing
architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural
networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel
variants based on sparsity and the Walsh--Hadamard transform. We prove that,
unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4 and Mamba, SLiCEs employing
block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh--Hadamard matrices match the maximal
expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$
state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length
generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and
match the state-of-the-art performance of log neural controlled differential
equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting

Abstract: The widespread use of sensors in modern power grids has led to the
accumulation of large amounts of voltage and current waveform data, especially
during fault events. However, the lack of labeled datasets poses a significant
challenge for fault classification and analysis. This paper explores the
application of unsupervised clustering techniques for fault diagnosis in
high-voltage power systems. A dataset provided by the Reseau de Transport
d'Electricite (RTE) is analyzed, with frequency domain features extracted using
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The K-Means algorithm is then applied to
identify underlying patterns in the data, enabling automated fault
categorization without the need for labeled training samples. The resulting
clusters are evaluated in collaboration with power system experts to assess
their alignment with real-world fault characteristics. The results demonstrate
the potential of unsupervised learning for scalable and data-driven fault
analysis, providing a robust approach to detecting and classifying power system
faults with minimal prior assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法在非线性学习中表现强大，但存在内存开销高和模型多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出Joker框架，结合双块坐标下降与信任区域方法（DBCD-TR）和随机特征核近似，降低内存成本并提高效率。

Result: 实验显示Joker节省高达90%内存，同时保持或超越现有方法的训练时间和性能。

Conclusion: Joker为大规模核学习提供了一种高效且低内存消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools for nonlinear learning with
well-established theory. The scalability issue has been their long-standing
challenge. Despite the existing success, there are two limitations in
large-scale kernel methods: (i) The memory overhead is too high for users to
afford; (ii) existing efforts mainly focus on kernel ridge regression (KRR),
while other models lack study. In this paper, we propose Joker, a joint
optimization framework for diverse kernel models, including KRR, logistic
regression, and support vector machines. We design a dual block coordinate
descent method with trust region (DBCD-TR) and adopt kernel approximation with
randomized features, leading to low memory costs and high efficiency in
large-scale learning. Experiments show that Joker saves up to 90\% memory but
achieves comparable training time and performance (or even better) than the
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ITDA的新方法，用于分解语言模型的激活，相比传统稀疏自编码器（SAE），ITDA训练成本低且支持跨模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）训练成本高且无法跨模型使用，因此需要一种更高效且支持跨模型比较的方法。

Method: 通过贪婪构建激活字典，选择最差匹配的激活进行训练，ITDA仅需1%的时间和数据即可完成训练。

Result: ITDA在部分目标模型上表现接近SAE，但通常性能稍逊；其字典支持跨模型比较，且Jaccard相似性指数优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITDA是一种低成本替代方案，适用于计算资源有限或需要跨模型比较的场景。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage
Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their
substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which
are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE
latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not
transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity
measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA)
models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To
train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations
on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst
approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be
trained in just 1\% of the time required for SAEs, using 1\% of the data. This
allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU.
ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target
LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries
enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-LoRA是一种新型的、基于上下文的低秩适应方法，通过动态调整不确定性估计，解决了传统LoRA在少样本场景中预测过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA在少样本场景中容易产生过度自信的预测，且现有方法未考虑输入特性对预测不确定性的影响。

Method: 提出C-LoRA，通过为每个输入样本开发轻量级LoRA模块，动态调整不确定性估计，并将数据驱动的上下文纳入参数后验。

Result: C-LoRA在不确定性量化和模型泛化方面优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证了上下文模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: C-LoRA为少样本场景下的鲁棒、不确定性感知的LLM微调设定了新标准。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions
in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical
statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable
uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input
characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this
limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a
novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by
developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data
sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven
contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves
well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty
quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the
critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific
uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM
fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.

*Harish G. Ramaswamy,L. A. Prashanth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在回归问题中估计和优化基于效用的短缺风险（UBSR）的问题，提出了一种基于梯度与线性最小化预言机的二分算法，并证明了其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在回归问题中，UBSR是一个非线性函数，传统的经验风险最小化方法难以直接优化，因此需要新的估计和优化方法。

Method: 首先推导了UBSR的浓度界，然后将UBSR优化问题转化为在损失分布空间中的伪线性函数最小化问题，设计了梯度预言机和线性最小化预言机，并提出了二分算法。

Result: 提出的算法能够收敛到UBSR最优解。

Conclusion: 该研究为UBSR的估计和优化提供了有效的算法框架，并证明了其收敛性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating and optimizing utility-based shortfall
risk (UBSR) of a loss, say $(Y - \hat Y)^2$, in the context of a regression
problem. Empirical risk minimization with a UBSR objective is challenging since
UBSR is a non-linear function of the underlying distribution. We first derive a
concentration bound for UBSR estimation using independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We then frame the UBSR optimization problem as
minimization of a pseudo-linear function in the space of achievable
distributions $\mathcal D$ of the loss $(Y- \hat Y)^2$. We construct a gradient
oracle for the UBSR objective and a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the
set $\mathcal D$. Using these oracles, we devise a bisection-type algorithm,
and establish convergence to the UBSR-optimal solution.

TL;DR: SupGCL是一种新型的图对比学习方法，专门针对基因调控网络，通过引入生物相关的基因敲除数据作为监督信号，显著提升了生物下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图对比学习方法在应用于生物网络（如基因调控网络）时，忽略了生物相关的扰动（如基因敲除），导致性能受限。

Method: SupGCL通过数学扩展现有方法，将非生物扰动模型转化为利用基因敲除数据的概率模型，直接结合生物扰动作为监督信号。

Result: 在多种癌症患者的真实基因调控网络数据集上，SupGCL在所有实验中均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SupGCL通过引入生物相关扰动，显著提升了基因调控网络的表示学习能力，为生物下游任务提供了更优的性能。

Abstract: Graph representation learning is effective for obtaining a meaningful latent
space utilizing the structure of graph data and is widely applied, including
biological networks. In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has
emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying
perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing
GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs),
they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene
knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive
Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological
perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision.
SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological
perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene
perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation
obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of
biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease
subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification
(node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients
with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖监督微调，且在历史证据有限时表现不佳，需要一种更高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Method: 结合多跳检索、轻量级适配器的对比微调和基于嵌入相似度的语义过滤。

Result: 在四个TKG基准测试中，RECIPE-TKG性能优于现有方法，Hits@10提升30.6%，且预测更语义连贯。

Conclusion: RECIPE-TKG在历史数据稀疏时仍能高效生成准确且语义一致的预测。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) represent dynamic facts as timestamped
relations between entities. TKG completion involves forecasting missing or
future links, requiring models to reason over time-evolving structure. While
LLMs show promise for this task, existing approaches often overemphasize
supervised fine-tuning and struggle particularly when historical evidence is
limited or missing. We introduce RECIPE-TKG, a lightweight and data-efficient
framework designed to improve accuracy and generalization in settings with
sparse historical context. It combines (1) rule-based multi-hop retrieval for
structurally diverse history, (2) contrastive fine-tuning of lightweight
adapters to encode relational semantics, and (3) test-time semantic filtering
to iteratively refine generations based on embedding similarity. Experiments on
four TKG benchmarks show that RECIPE-TKG outperforms previous LLM-based
approaches, achieving up to 30.6\% relative improvement in Hits@10. Moreover,
our proposed framework produces more semantically coherent predictions, even
for the samples with limited historical context.

TL;DR: VLMD是一种新算法，用于从多变量信号中提取振荡模式和相关连接结构，解决了现有MMD技术的高计算成本、参数敏感性和通道间依赖建模不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMD技术存在高计算成本、对参数选择敏感以及通道间依赖建模较弱的问题，VLMD旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: VLMD基于LMD模型，结合稀疏编码和模式分解，将多通道信号表示为共享潜在成分的稀疏线性组合，并通过变分优化问题实现重构保真度、稀疏性和频率正则化。

Result: 实验表明，VLMD在合成和真实数据集上的准确性、效率和结构可解释性优于现有MMD方法。

Conclusion: VLMD通过改进的模型和优化方法，显著提升了多变量信号分析的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Variational Latent Mode Decomposition (VLMD), a new algorithm
for extracting oscillatory modes and associated connectivity structures from
multivariate signals. VLMD addresses key limitations of existing Multivariate
Mode Decomposition (MMD) techniques -including high computational cost,
sensitivity to parameter choices, and weak modeling of interchannel
dependencies. Its improved performance is driven by a novel underlying model,
Latent Mode Decomposition (LMD), which blends sparse coding and mode
decomposition to represent multichannel signals as sparse linear combinations
of shared latent components composed of AM-FM oscillatory modes. This
formulation enables VLMD to operate in a lower-dimensional latent space,
enhancing robustness to noise, scalability, and interpretability. The algorithm
solves a constrained variational optimization problem that jointly enforces
reconstruction fidelity, sparsity, and frequency regularization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLMD outperforms
state-of-the-art MMD methods in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of
extracted structures.

Abstract: Coreset selection targets the challenge of finding a small, representative
subset of a large dataset that preserves essential patterns for effective
machine learning. Although several surveys have examined data reduction
strategies before, most focus narrowly on either classical geometry-based
methods or active learning techniques. In contrast, this survey presents a more
comprehensive view by unifying three major lines of coreset research, namely,
training-free, training-oriented, and label-free approaches, into a single
taxonomy. We present subfields often overlooked by existing work, including
submodular formulations, bilevel optimization, and recent progress in
pseudo-labeling for unlabeled datasets. Additionally, we examine how pruning
strategies influence generalization and neural scaling laws, offering new
insights that are absent from prior reviews. Finally, we compare these methods
under varying computational, robustness, and performance demands and highlight
open challenges, such as robustness, outlier filtering, and adapting coreset
selection to foundation models, for future research.

Motivation: 现有交互式贝叶斯优化方法通过加权采集函数引入用户先验分布，但难以准确反映用户信念，尤其是在内层优化复杂的情况下。

Method: 利用概率电路（PCs）作为代理模型，构建可处理的联合分布，支持精确条件推理和采样，提出无采集函数的选择策略。

Result: 在标准超参数优化任务中表现优异，且在交互式优化中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过消除内层优化需求，更准确地整合用户反馈，实现了高性能的交互式超参数优化。

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in designing truly interactive hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) methods, to date, only a few allow to include human
feedback. Existing interactive Bayesian optimization (BO) methods incorporate
human beliefs by weighting the acquisition function with a user-defined prior
distribution. However, in light of the non-trivial inner optimization of the
acquisition function prevalent in BO, such weighting schemes do not always
accurately reflect given user beliefs. We introduce a novel BO approach
leveraging tractable probabilistic models named probabilistic circuits (PCs) as
a surrogate model. PCs encode a tractable joint distribution over the hybrid
hyperparameter space and evaluation scores. They enable exact conditional
inference and sampling. Based on conditional sampling, we construct a novel
selection policy that enables an acquisition function-free generation of
candidate points (thereby eliminating the need for an additional inner-loop
optimization) and ensures that user beliefs are reflected accurately in the
selection policy. We provide a theoretical analysis and an extensive empirical
evaluation, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in standard HPO and outperforms interactive BO baselines in interactive HPO.

Result: 对21种先进向量索引在12个分布内和6个分布外数据集上进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: VIBE为ANN搜索算法的性能评估提供了更现代、更全面的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a performance-critical component
of many machine learning pipelines. Rigorous benchmarking is essential for
evaluating the performance of vector indexes for ANN search. However, the
datasets of the existing benchmarks are no longer representative of the current
applications of ANN search. Hence, there is an urgent need for an up-to-date
set of benchmarks. To this end, we introduce Vector Index Benchmark for
Embeddings (VIBE), an open source project for benchmarking ANN algorithms. VIBE
contains a pipeline for creating benchmark datasets using dense embedding
models characteristic of modern applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). To replicate real-world workloads, we also include
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets where the queries and the corpus are drawn
from different distributions. We use VIBE to conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of SOTA vector indexes, benchmarking 21 implementations on 12 in-distribution
and 6 out-of-distribution datasets.

Motivation: GCRL在视觉环境中面临高维稀疏观测的挑战，传统方法可能导致潜在空间过度集中于频繁访问的状态，影响技能学习的全面性。

Method: 提出DRAG方法，结合β-VAE框架和分布鲁棒优化，通过对抗性加权训练状态，构建语义丰富的潜在空间。

Result: DRAG在迷宫和机器人控制等硬探索环境中显著提升了状态空间覆盖和下游控制性能。

Conclusion: DRAG无需预训练或先验环境知识，有效解决了GCRL中潜在空间覆盖不足的问题。

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously
acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments
due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online
setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space
evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the
environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the
representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to
latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited
by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the
agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it
learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce
distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space,
to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We
introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that
combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization.
DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to
account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts
of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful
latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state
space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration
environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass,
without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

Result: 实验表明，TransDF实现了最先进的性能，并兼容多种预测模型。

Conclusion: TransDF有效解决了标签自相关和任务量过大的问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Training time-series forecasting models presents unique challenges in
designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize
the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label
autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2)
excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and
complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose
Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label
sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models
are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively
mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and
is compatible with various forecasting models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN训练依赖BPTT，导致内存和计算成本随上下文长度和模型规模线性增长，限制了长上下文训练。

Method: 使用零阶优化方法（如RGE和CD-RGE）替代BPTT，避免存储中间激活值，减少内存占用。

Result: 在过拟合、转导和语言建模任务中，新方法匹配或超越BPTT性能，收敛速度提升高达19倍，且内存和计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法为RNN训练提供了一种高效替代方案，尤其在长上下文场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: During inference, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) scale constant in both
FLOPs and GPU memory with increasing context length, as they compress all prior
tokens into a fixed-size memory. In contrast, transformers scale linearly in
FLOPs and, at best, linearly in memory during generation, since they must
attend to all previous tokens explicitly. Despite this inference-time
advantage, training large RNNs on long contexts remains impractical because
standard optimization methods depend on Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).
BPTT requires retention of all intermediate activations during the forward
pass, causing memory usage to scale linearly with both context length and model
size. In this paper, we show that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) methods such as
Random-vector Gradient Estimation (RGE) can successfully replace BPTT to train
RNNs with convergence rates that match, or exceed BPTT by up to 19 fold, while
using orders of magnitude less memory and cost, as the model remains in
inference mode throughout training. We further demonstrate that
Central-Difference RGE (CD-RGE) corresponds to optimizing a smoothed surrogate
loss, inherently regularizing training and improving generalization. Our method
matches or outperforms BPTT across three settings: (1) overfitting, (2)
transduction, and (3) language modeling. Across all tasks, with sufficient
perturbations, our models generalize as well as or better than those trained
with BPTT, often in fewer steps. Despite the need for more forward passes per
step, we can surpass BPTT wall-clock time per step using recent advancements
such as FlashRNN and distributed inference.

Conclusion: 该方法通过潜在空间和迭代细化显著提升了神经网络验证的效率和准确性，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Neural networks are ubiquitous. However, they are often sensitive to small
input changes. Hence, to prevent unexpected behavior in safety-critical
applications, their formal verification -- a notoriously hard problem -- is
necessary. Many state-of-the-art verification algorithms use reachability
analysis or abstract interpretation to enclose the set of possible outputs of a
neural network. Often, the verification is inconclusive due to the conservatism
of the enclosure. To address this problem, we design a novel latent space for
formal verification that enables the transfer of output specifications to the
input space for an iterative specification-driven input refinement, i.e., we
iteratively reduce the set of possible inputs to only enclose the unsafe ones.
The latent space is constructed from a novel view of projection-based set
representations, e.g., zonotopes, which are commonly used in reachability
analysis of neural networks. A projection-based set representation is a
"shadow" of a higher-dimensional set -- a latent space -- that does not change
during a set propagation through a neural network. Hence, the input set and the
output enclosure are "shadows" of the same latent space that we can use to
transfer constraints. We present an efficient verification tool for neural
networks that uses our iterative refinement to significantly reduce the number
of subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure. Using zonotopes as a set
representation, unlike many other state-of-the-art approaches, our approach can
be realized by only using matrix operations, which enables a significant
speed-up through efficient GPU acceleration. We demonstrate that our tool
achieves competitive performance, which would place it among the top-ranking
tools of the last neural network verification competition (VNN-COMP'24).

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了贝叶斯学习的计算成本，使其适用于大规模模型的训练。

Abstract: While offering a principled framework for uncertainty quantification in deep
learning, the employment of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) is still
constrained by their increased computational requirements and the convergence
difficulties when training very deep, state-of-the-art architectures. In this
work, we reinterpret weight-sharing quantization techniques from a stochastic
perspective in the context of training and inference with Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs). Specifically, we leverage 2D adaptive Gaussian distributions,
Wasserstein distance estimations, and alpha blending to encode the stochastic
behaviour of a BNN in a lower dimensional, soft Gaussian representation.
Through extensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces the computational overhead inherent in Bayesian learning
by several orders of magnitude, enabling the efficient Bayesian training of
large-scale models, such as ResNet-101 and Vision Transformer (VIT). On various
computer vision benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet1k. Our
approach compresses model parameters by approximately 50x and reduces model
size by 75, while achieving accuracy and uncertainty estimations comparable to
the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法无法在噪声标签下保持模型参数的一致性（重新下降性质），导致对齐效果受限。

Method: 提出H\"older-DPO，一种具备重新下降性质的对齐损失函数，通过估计干净数据分布和检测错误标签来提升鲁棒性。

Result: H\"older-DPO在鲁棒对齐性能上达到最优，并能准确检测错误标签，移除这些标签显著提升对齐效果。

Conclusion: H\"older-DPO为噪声反馈下的对齐问题提供了理论支持，并展示了实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite the importance of aligning language models with human preferences,
crowd-sourced human feedback is often noisy -- for example, preferring less
desirable responses -- posing a fundamental challenge to alignment. A truly
robust alignment objective should yield identical model parameters even under
severe label noise, a property known as redescending. We prove that no existing
alignment methods satisfy this property. To address this, we propose
H\"older-DPO, the first principled alignment loss with a provable redescending
property, enabling estimation of the clean data distribution from noisy
feedback. The aligned model estimates the likelihood of clean data, providing a
theoretically grounded metric for dataset valuation that identifies the
location and fraction of mislabels. This metric is gradient-free, enabling
scalable and automated human feedback valuation without costly manual
verification or clean validation dataset. H\"older-DPO achieves
state-of-the-art robust alignment performance while accurately detecting
mislabels in controlled datasets. Finally, we apply H\"older-DPO to widely used
alignment datasets, revealing substantial noise levels and demonstrating that
removing these mislabels significantly improves alignment performance across
methods.

Conclusion: 提出了一个理论框架，解释了数据分布和模型设计如何影响稀疏注意力的涌现动态。

Abstract: Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural
networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes
develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a
comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address
this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical
and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining
theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small
Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics
driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows
power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We
additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we
confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our
findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding
how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind
one form of emergence.

Conclusion: DesignX能够发现超越专家直觉的算法模式，为优化社区提供设计洞察。

Abstract: Designing effective black-box optimizers is hampered by limited
problem-specific knowledge and manual control that spans months for almost
every detail. In this paper, we present DesignX, the first automated algorithm
design framework that generates an effective optimizer specific to a given
black-box optimization problem within seconds. Rooted in the first principles,
we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2)
hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive
modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm
components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent
reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric
design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale
meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of
autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass
human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or
on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV
path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to
discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which,
conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高维或长序列时效率低下，需要一种独立于系统维度的高效方法。

Method: 通过固定光谱变换将对称LDS表示为可学习的卷积，并反转此表示以恢复LDS模型，形成端到端凸优化过程。

Result: SpectraLDS在序列预测任务中保持准确性，同时实现了与序列长度无关的恒定时间和空间推理效率。

Conclusion: SpectraLDS在语言建模等任务中显著提升了推理效率，同时保持了预测精度。

Abstract: We present the first provable method for identifying symmetric linear
dynamical systems (LDS) with accuracy guarantees that are independent of the
systems' state dimension or effective memory. Our approach builds upon recent
work that represents symmetric LDSs as convolutions learnable via fixed
spectral transformations. We show how to invert this representation, thereby
recovering an LDS model from its spectral transform and yielding an end-to-end
convex optimization procedure. This distillation preserves predictive accuracy
while enabling constant-time and constant-space inference per token,
independent of sequence length. We evaluate our method, SpectraLDS, as a
component in sequence prediction architectures and demonstrate that accuracy is
preserved while inference efficiency is improved on tasks such as language
modeling.

Conclusion: 所提算法在多目标群体识别问题中表现优异，具有理论和实际价值。

Abstract: We introduce the Best Group Identification problem in a multi-objective
multi-armed bandit setting, where an agent interacts with groups of arms with
vector-valued rewards. The performance of a group is determined by an
efficiency vector which represents the group's best attainable rewards across
different dimensions. The objective is to identify the set of optimal groups in
the fixed-confidence setting. We investigate two key formulations: group Pareto
set identification, where efficiency vectors of optimal groups are Pareto
optimal and linear best group identification, where each reward dimension has a
known weight and the optimal group maximizes the weighted sum of its efficiency
vector's entries. For both settings, we propose elimination-based algorithms,
establish upper bounds on their sample complexity, and derive lower bounds that
apply to any correct algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate
the strong empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.

Conclusion: 数据多样性对提升通用预测任务的训练效率和模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized
zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data
diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale
time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced
distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To
address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to
enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST
incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and
employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time
series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is
implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating
grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and
representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate
that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a
fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by
existing methods. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of data diversity in
improving both training efficiency and model performance for the universal
forecasting task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务预测存在表达瓶颈，导致不同时间步预测共享相同表示，即使最优表示也无法避免误差。

Method: 两阶段框架：预训练基础模型用于单步预测，再通过LoRA模块适配；引入MoLA模型，利用加权LoRA专家实现参数共享。

Result: MoLA显著提升模型表达能力，优于现有时间序列预测方法。

Conclusion: MoLA通过部分参数共享和自适应加权，有效解决了表达瓶颈问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series
forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness
Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same
representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal
representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework:
first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt
it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to
handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness
bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which
employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing
across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting
performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments
show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms
state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SGMFS的多标签半监督特征选择方法，解决了传统方法在标签相关性和图结构优化上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法无法处理多标签数据，且现有半监督方法在标签相关性和图结构优化上表现不佳。

Method: SGMFS通过构建低维独立标签子空间和稀疏重构样本，自适应学习相似图，保持空间一致性。

Result: 实验验证了SGMFS的优越性，能够有效提升特征选择性能。

Conclusion: SGMFS在多标签半监督场景下表现出色，解决了标签相关性和图结构优化的关键问题。

Abstract: In practical domains, high-dimensional data are usually associated with
diverse semantic labels, whereas traditional feature selection methods are
designed for single-label data. Moreover, existing multi-label methods
encounter two main challenges in semi-supervised scenarios: (1). Most
semi-supervised methods fail to evaluate the label correlations without enough
labeled samples, which are the critical information of multi-label feature
selection, making label-specific features discarded. (2). The similarity graph
structure directly derived from the original feature space is suboptimal for
multi-label problems in existing graph-based methods, leading to unreliable
soft labels and degraded feature selection performance. To overcome them, we
propose a consistent sparse graph learning method for multi-label
semi-supervised feature selection (SGMFS), which can enhance the feature
selection performance by maintaining space consistency and learning label
correlations in semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, for Challenge (1),
SGMFS learns a low-dimensional and independent label subspace from the
projected features, which can compatibly cross multiple labels and effectively
achieve the label correlations. For Challenge (2), instead of constructing a
fixed similarity graph for semi-supervised learning, SGMFS thoroughly explores
the intrinsic structure of the data by performing sparse reconstruction of
samples in both the label space and the learned subspace simultaneously. In
this way, the similarity graph can be adaptively learned to maintain the
consistency between label space and the learned subspace, which can promote
propagating proper soft labels for unlabeled samples, facilitating the ultimate
feature selection. An effective solution with fast convergence is designed to
optimize the objective function. Extensive experiments validate the superiority
of SGMFS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAV计算方法在大规模高维架构中计算成本高，限制了应用。

Method: 提出FastCAV方法，理论支持其与SVM方法等效，加速CAV提取。

Result: FastCAV加速效果显著（平均46.4倍），性能稳定，适用于下游任务。

Conclusion: FastCAV为深度模型的概念研究提供了高效工具，扩展了研究可能性。

Abstract: Concepts such as objects, patterns, and shapes are how humans understand the
world. Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to
study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to
human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an
important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not.
However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV
computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale,
high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce
FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to
63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach
and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established
SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with
FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In
downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that
FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our
approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we
demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.

Conclusion: 该工作为实践者提供了一个可扩展的框架，以整合未来UniDA和时间序列架构的进展。

Abstract: Deep learning models have significantly improved the ability to detect
novelties in time series (TS) data. This success is attributed to their strong
representation capabilities. However, due to the inherent variability in TS
data, these models often struggle with generalization and robustness. To
address this, a common approach is to perform Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,
particularly Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA), to handle domain shifts and
emerging novel classes. While extensively studied in computer vision, UniDA
remains underexplored for TS data. This work provides a comprehensive
implementation and comparison of state-of-the-art TS backbones in a UniDA
framework. We propose a reliable protocol to evaluate their robustness and
generalization across different domains. The goal is to provide practitioners
with a framework that can be easily extended to incorporate future advancements
in UniDA and TS architectures. Our results highlight the critical influence of
backbone selection in UniDA performance and enable a robustness analysis across
various datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: NeuroTrails是一种高效的模型无关训练范式，能够在减少资源的同时提升集成性能。

Abstract: Model ensembles have long been a cornerstone for improving generalization and
robustness in deep learning. However, their effectiveness often comes at the
cost of substantial computational overhead. To address this issue,
state-of-the-art methods aim to replicate ensemble-class performance without
requiring multiple independently trained networks. Unfortunately, these
algorithms often still demand considerable compute at inference. In response to
these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{NeuroTrails}$, a sparse multi-head
architecture with dynamically evolving topology. This unexplored model-agnostic
training paradigm improves ensemble performance while reducing the required
resources. We analyze the underlying reason for its effectiveness and observe
that the various neural trails induced by dynamic sparsity attain a
$\textit{Goldilocks zone}$ of prediction diversity. NeuroTrails displays
efficacy with convolutional and transformer-based architectures on computer
vision and language tasks. Experiments on ResNet-50/ImageNet, LLaMA-350M/C4,
among many others, demonstrate increased accuracy and stronger robustness in
zero-shot generalization, while requiring significantly fewer parameters.

Result: 在多个表格数据基准测试中，DeLTa实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeLTa为LLM在表格数据中的应用提供了新方向，避免了现有方法的局限性，并展示了显著效果。

Abstract: Tabular data have been playing a vital role in diverse real-world fields,
including healthcare, finance, etc. With the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLMs), early explorations of extending LLMs to the domain of tabular
data have been developed. Most of these LLM-based methods typically first
serialize tabular data into natural language descriptions, and then tune LLMs
or directly infer on these serialized data. However, these methods suffer from
two key inherent issues: (i) data perspective: existing data serialization
methods lack universal applicability for structured tabular data, and may pose
privacy risks through direct textual exposure, and (ii) model perspective: LLM
fine-tuning methods struggle with tabular data, and in-context learning
scalability is bottle-necked by input length constraints (suitable for few-shot
learning). This work explores a novel direction of integrating LLMs into
tabular data throughough logical decision tree rules as intermediaries,
proposes a decision tree enhancer with LLM-derived rule for tabular prediction,
DeLTa. The proposed DeLTa avoids tabular data serialization, and can be applied
to full data learning setting without LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, we
leverage the reasoning ability of LLMs to redesign an improved rule given a set
of decision tree rules. Furthermore, we provide a calibration method for
original decision trees via new generated rule by LLM, which approximates the
error correction vector to steer the original decision tree predictions in the
direction of ``errors'' reducing. Finally, extensive experiments on diverse
tabular benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: KITINet通过物理启发的特征优化机制，实现了网络参数的稀疏化集中，为残差网络设计提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Despite the widely recognized success of residual connections in modern
neural networks, their design principles remain largely heuristic. This paper
introduces KITINet (Kinetics Theory Inspired Network), a novel architecture
that reinterprets feature propagation through the lens of non-equilibrium
particle dynamics and partial differential equation (PDE) simulation. At its
core, we propose a residual module that models feature updates as the
stochastic evolution of a particle system, numerically simulated via a
discretized solver for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). This formulation
mimics particle collisions and energy exchange, enabling adaptive feature
refinement via physics-informed interactions. Additionally, we reveal that this
mechanism induces network parameter condensation during training, where
parameters progressively concentrate into a sparse subset of dominant channels.
Experiments on scientific computation (PDE operator), image classification
(CIFAR-10/100), and text classification (IMDb/SNLI) show consistent
improvements over classic network baselines, with negligible increase of FLOPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU资源管理对患者护理至关重要，尤其是在COVID-19大流行期间。研究旨在评估机器学习在神经疾病患者LOS预测中的适用性。

Method: 研究比较了经典ML算法（如KNN、随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost）和神经网络（如LSTM、BERT、Temporal Fusion Transformer），将LOS分为三类进行预测。

Result: 随机森林在静态数据上表现最佳（准确率0.68），而BERT在时间序列数据上表现最优（准确率0.80）。

Conclusion: 研究表明机器学习可用于改进ICU资源管理，但需根据数据类型选择合适模型。

Abstract: Intensive care unit (ICU) is a crucial hospital department that handles
life-threatening cases. Nowadays machine learning (ML) is being leveraged in
healthcare ubiquitously. In recent years, management of ICU became one of the
most significant parts of the hospital functionality (largely but not only due
to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). This study explores multiple ML approaches
for predicting LOS in ICU specifically for the patients with neurological
diseases based on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The evaluated models include classic ML
algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost) and
Neural Networks (LSTM, BERT and Temporal Fusion Transformer). Given that LOS
prediction is often framed as a classification task, this study categorizes LOS
into three groups: less than two days, less than a week, and a week or more. As
the first ML-based approach targeting LOS prediction for neurological disorder
patients, this study does not aim to outperform existing methods but rather to
assess their effectiveness in this specific context. The findings provide
insights into the applicability of ML techniques for improving ICU resource
management and patient care. According to the results, Random Forest model
proved to outperform others on static, achieving an accuracy of 0.68, a
precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.68, and F1-score of 0.67. While BERT model
outperformed LSTM model on time-series data with an accuracy of 0.80, a
precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.80 and F1-score 0.80.

Conclusion: 输入-输出视角是对现有分析方法的补充，有助于理解概念表示的富集过程。

Abstract: Interpretability researchers have attempted to understand MLP neurons of
language models based on both the contexts in which they activate and their
output weight vectors. They have paid little attention to a complementary
aspect: the interactions between input and output. For example, when neurons
detect a direction in the input, they might add much the same direction to the
residual stream ("enrichment neurons") or reduce its presence ("depletion
neurons"). We address this aspect by examining the cosine similarity between
input and output weights of a neuron. We apply our method to 12 models and find
that enrichment neurons dominate in early-middle layers whereas later layers
tend more towards depletion. To explain this finding, we argue that enrichment
neurons are largely responsible for enriching concept representations, one of
the first steps of factual recall. Our input-output perspective is a complement
to activation-dependent analyses and to approaches that treat input and output
separately.

Conclusion: SSNs为拓扑深度学习提供了新的理论框架，并在脑网络数据学习中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from pairwise interactions but
often overlook multi-way and hierarchical relationships. Topological Deep
Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial
topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected
settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in
many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both
abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce
Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that
operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode
directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance
scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most
informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly
more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new
principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in
the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to
successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks,
outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by
up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled
topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a
unique real-world case study for TDL. We also test SSNs on standard node
classification and edge regression tasks, showing competitive performance. We
will make the code and data publicly available.

TL;DR: VeriThinker通过辅助验证任务压缩Chain-of-Thought推理链，减少推理成本，同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现出色，但过长的推理链增加了计算成本。VeriThinker旨在通过验证任务抑制过度思考。

Method: 通过训练LRMs验证CoT解决方案的正确性，使其更谨慎地选择后续推理步骤，从而压缩推理链。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME25数据集上，推理链长度显著减少，准确性略有提升。

Conclusion: VeriThinker有效减少推理成本，且具有零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex tasks using Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning. However, their tendency to overthinking leads to unnecessarily
lengthy reasoning chains, dramatically increasing inference costs. To mitigate
this issue, we introduce VeriThinker, a novel approach for CoT compression.
Unlike conventional methods that fine-tune LRMs directly on the original
reasoning task using synthetic concise CoT data, we innovatively fine-tune the
model solely through an auxiliary verification task. By training LRMs to
accurately verify the correctness of CoT solutions, the LRMs inherently become
more discerning about the necessity of subsequent self-reflection steps,
thereby effectively suppressing overthinking. Extensive experiments validate
that VeriThinker substantially reduces reasoning chain lengths while
maintaining or even slightly improving accuracy. When applied to
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, our approach reduces reasoning tokens on MATH500
from 3790 to 2125 while improving accuracy by 0.8% (94.0% to 94.8%), and on
AIME25, tokens decrease from 14321 to 10287 with a 2.1% accuracy gain (38.7% to
40.8%). Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that VeriThinker can also be
zero-shot generalized to speculative reasoning. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架的训练方法，用于二进制和脉冲神经网络，无需归一化层即可达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如替代梯度法）通常依赖启发式且对超参数敏感，而本文方法基于概率模型，支持端到端梯度优化。

Method: 引入重要性加权直通（IW-ST）估计器，统一了直通和基于松弛的估计器，并通过辅助损失实现偏差最小化目标。进一步提出Spiking Bayesian Neural Networks（SBNNs），利用后验噪声训练网络。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法通过减少梯度偏差、正则化参数和引入噪声，实现了深度残差网络的训练，无需归一化层。

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for training binary and spiking neural
networks that achieves state-of-the-art performance without normalisation
layers. Unlike commonly used surrogate gradient methods -- often heuristic and
sensitive to hyperparameter choices -- our approach is grounded in a
probabilistic model of noisy binary networks, enabling fully end-to-end
gradient-based optimisation. We introduce importance-weighted straight-through
(IW-ST) estimators, a unified class generalising straight-through and
relaxation-based estimators. We characterise the bias-variance trade-off in
this family and derive a bias-minimising objective implemented via an auxiliary
loss. Building on this, we introduce Spiking Bayesian Neural Networks (SBNNs),
a variational inference framework that uses posterior noise to train Binary and
Spiking Neural Networks with IW-ST. This Bayesian approach minimises gradient
bias, regularises parameters, and introduces dropout-like noise. By linking
low-bias conditions, vanishing gradients, and the KL term, we enable training
of deep residual networks without normalisation. Experiments on CIFAR-10, DVS
Gesture, and SHD show our method matches or exceeds existing approaches without
normalisation or hand-tuned gradients.

Result: 实验证明该方法在性能和效率上媲美SVD，同时显著降低运行时和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法为低秩优化提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large
language models (LLMs) to reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by
constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically
projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to
each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional
memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a
computationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to
approximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces.
First, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal
matrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select
basis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each
projection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication
followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis
vectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are
computed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the
indices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection
matrices for each layer. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and
fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in
approximating optimal low-rank projections, matching the performance of costly
SVD-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: 主动干预能有效提升LLM逆向工程黑盒系统的能力，为其在科学发现中的应用提供实用指导。

Abstract: Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate
scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well
an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from
its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)
learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively
collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs
across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent
different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have
considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through
extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from
observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of
Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only
observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific
inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs
to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data
from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of
engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling
results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that
engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:
overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the
black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.
These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively
reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new
discoveries.

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅使用Fisher信息矩阵的对角近似，忽略了参数相关性，导致下游任务性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了GFWSVD技术，结合Kronecker分解近似算法，以高效计算Fisher信息矩阵的对角和非对角元素。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，GFWSVD在20倍压缩率下比FWSVD、SVD-LLM和ASVD分别提升了5%、3%和6%。

Conclusion: GFWSVD通过更全面地利用Fisher信息矩阵，显著提升了LLM压缩的性能。

Abstract: The Fisher information is a fundamental concept for characterizing the
sensitivity of parameters in neural networks. However, leveraging the full
observed Fisher information is too expensive for large models, so most methods
rely on simple diagonal approximations. While efficient, this approach ignores
parameter correlations, often resulting in reduced performance on downstream
tasks. In this work, we mitigate these limitations and propose Generalized
Fisher-Weighted SVD (GFWSVD), a post-training LLM compression technique that
accounts for both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Fisher information
matrix, providing a more accurate reflection of parameter importance. To make
the method tractable, we introduce a scalable adaptation of the
Kronecker-factored approximation algorithm for the observed Fisher information.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LLM compression, showing
improvements over existing compression baselines. For example, at a 20
compression rate on the MMLU benchmark, our method outperforms FWSVD, which is
based on a diagonal approximation of the Fisher information, by 5 percent,
SVD-LLM by 3 percent, and ASVD by 6 percent compression rate.

Abstract: Real world collection of Activities of Daily Living data is challenging due

specifically designed to synthesize realistic, event triggered, and symbolic
sensor sequences for ambient assistive environments. ADLGen integrates a
decoder only Transformer with sign based symbolic temporal encoding, and a
context and layout aware sampling mechanism to guide generation toward
semantically rich and physically plausible sensor event sequences. To enhance
semantic fidelity and correct structural inconsistencies, we further
incorporate a large language model into an automatic generate evaluate refine
loop, which verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates
correction rules without manual intervention or environment specific tuning.
Through comprehensive experiments with novel evaluation metrics, ADLGen is
shown to outperform baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic
richness, and downstream activity recognition, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving solution for ADL data synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管R1-style强化学习（RL）显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，但其基于规则的机制尚不明确，且小规模监督微调（SFT）效率低下。

Method: 提出分析框架比较SFT和RL的样本效率，并提出Re-distillation技术，通过小规模蒸馏RL策略微调预训练模型。

Result: 在Knight & Knave和MATH数据集上，Re-distillation技术以更少样本和计算量匹配RL性能。例如，Qwen2.5-1.5B模型在1K SFT样本下超越DeepSeek-V3-0324。

Conclusion: Re-distillation技术揭示了R1-style RL的成功机制，为高效模型微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language
Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains
unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has significant influence on RL but
shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical
framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring sample effect.
Hypothetical analysis show that SFT efficiency is limited by training data.
Guided by our analysis, we propose Re-distillation, a technique that fine-tunes
pretrain model through small-scale distillation from the RL-trained policy.
Experiments on Knight & Knave and MATH datasets demonstrate re-distillation's
surprising efficiency: re-distilled models match RL performance with far fewer
samples and less computation. Empirical verification shows that sample effect
is a good indicator of performance improvements. As a result, on K&K dataset,
our re-distilled Qwen2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT
samples. On MATH, Qwen2.5-1.5B fine-tuned with re-distilled 500 samples matches
its instruct-tuned variant without RL. Our work explains several interesting
phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical
success. Code is available at: https://github.com/on1262/deep-reasoning

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在数学和编码领域取得了成功，但在预测领域（如预测市场）的应用较少，主要因为二进制、延迟和噪声奖励的挑战。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过改进GRPO和ReMax算法，移除方差缩放、应用基线调整优势，并使用10万条合成问题和轻量级规则进行训练，最终在11万事件上实现稳定训练。

Result: 14B模型在保持准确性的同时，校准性显著优于前沿基线（Brier=0.193，ECE=0.042），并通过简单交易规则产生127美元的假设利润。

Conclusion: 改进的RLVR方法可以将小规模LLM转化为具有经济价值的预测工具，并为更大模型的扩展提供了启示。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has boosted math and
coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend
RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is
that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from
binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is
brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match
frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical
prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative
Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our
adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply
baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally
consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that
penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a
single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and
ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline
o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in
calibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this
calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p =
0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale
LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with
implications for scaling this to larger models.

Abstract: The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By
systematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous
sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical
understanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial
for guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion
by exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its
assumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield
more robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies
of value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of
adaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the

Conclusion: CVGAD通过解决干扰边问题，显著提升了图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in graph-based
data, with wide applications in fields such as web security and financial fraud
detection. Existing methods typically rely on contrastive learning, assuming
that a lower similarity between a node and its local subgraph indicates
abnormality. However, these approaches overlook a crucial limitation: the
presence of interfering edges invalidates this assumption, since it introduces
disruptive noise that compromises the contrastive learning process.
Consequently, this limitation impairs the ability to effectively learn
meaningful representations of normal patterns, leading to suboptimal detection
performance. To address this issue, we propose a Clean-View Enhanced Graph
Anomaly Detection framework (CVGAD), which includes a multi-scale anomaly
awareness module to identify key sources of interference in the contrastive
learning process. Moreover, to mitigate bias from the one-step edge removal
process, we introduce a novel progressive purification module. This module
incrementally refines the graph by iteratively identifying and removing
interfering edges, thereby enhancing model performance. Extensive experiments
on five benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究为严格证明AI滥用风险低提供了一条具体路径，尽管并非唯一路径。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of AI misuse safeguards provide a patchwork of evidence
that is often difficult to connect to real-world decisions. To bridge this gap,
we describe an end-to-end argument (a "safety case") that misuse safeguards
reduce the risk posed by an AI assistant to low levels. We first describe how a
hypothetical developer red teams safeguards, estimating the effort required to
evade them. Then, the developer plugs this estimate into a quantitative "uplift
model" to determine how much barriers introduced by safeguards dissuade misuse
(https://www.aimisusemodel.com/). This procedure provides a continuous signal
of risk during deployment that helps the developer rapidly respond to emerging
threats. Finally, we describe how to tie these components together into a
simple safety case. Our work provides one concrete path -- though not the only
path -- to rigorously justifying AI misuse risks are low.

Abstract: Bisimulation metrics are powerful tools for measuring similarities between
stochastic processes, and specifically Markov chains. Recent advances have
uncovered that bisimulation metrics are, in fact, optimal-transport distances,
which has enabled the development of fast algorithms for computing such metrics
with provable accuracy and runtime guarantees. However, these recent methods,
as well as all previously known methods, assume full knowledge of the
transition dynamics. This is often an impractical assumption in most real-world
scenarios, where typically only sample trajectories are available. In this
work, we propose a stochastic optimization method that addresses this
limitation and estimates bisimulation metrics based on sample access, without
requiring explicit transition models. Our approach is derived from a new linear
programming (LP) formulation of bisimulation metrics, which we solve using a
stochastic primal-dual optimization method. We provide theoretical guarantees
on the sample complexity of the algorithm and validate its effectiveness
through a series of empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: SAL算法为生成模型在科学和工程问题中的应用提供了物理约束的严格保证，具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Deep generative models hold great promise for representing complex physical
systems, but their deployment is currently limited by the lack of guarantees on
the physical plausibility of the generated outputs. Ensuring that known
physical constraints are enforced is therefore critical when applying
generative models to scientific and engineering problems. We address this
limitation by developing a principled framework for sampling from a target
distribution while rigorously satisfying physical constraints. Leveraging the
variational formulation of Langevin dynamics, we propose Split Augmented
Langevin (SAL), a novel primal-dual sampling algorithm that enforces
constraints progressively through variable splitting, with convergence
guarantees. While the method is developed theoretically for Langevin dynamics,
we demonstrate its effective applicability to diffusion models. In particular,
we use constrained diffusion models to generate physical fields satisfying
energy and mass conservation laws. We apply our method to diffusion-based data
assimilation on a complex physical system, where enforcing physical constraints
substantially improves both forecast accuracy and the preservation of critical
conserved quantities. We also demonstrate the potential of SAL for challenging
feasibility problems in optimal control.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in developing spiking neural
networks (SNNs) as a potential solution to the energy challenges posed by
conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, our theoretical
understanding of SNNs remains relatively limited compared to the ever-growing
body of literature on ANNs. In this paper, we study a discrete-time model of
SNNs based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, referred to as
discrete-time LIF-SNNs, a widely used framework that still lacks solid
theoretical foundations. We demonstrate that discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static
inputs and outputs realize piecewise constant functions defined on polyhedral
regions, and more importantly, we quantify the network size required to
approximate continuous functions. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
latency (number of time steps) and depth (number of layers) on the complexity
of the input space partitioning induced by discrete-time LIF-SNNs. Our analysis
highlights the importance of latency and contrasts these networks with ANNs
employing piecewise linear activation functions. Finally, we present numerical
experiments to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We propose KnotGym, an interactive environment for complex, spatial reasoning
and manipulation. KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with
varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image
observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of
complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural
generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for
scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute
perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation. We evaluate methods
of different classes, including model-based RL, model-predictive control, and
chain-of-thought reasoning, and illustrate the challenges KnotGym presents.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is an important task for
deploying reliable machine learning models in safety-critial applications.
While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit
features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their
performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency
to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the
Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show
that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem
effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with
shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse
architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves
the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and
consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合线性规划和组合算法优势的框架，用于解决三种边缘着色聚类问题（Local ECC、Global ECC和Robust ECC），在保证高效计算的同时提供高质量解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统边缘着色聚类（ECC）存在非重叠和穷举的限制，为解决这一问题，研究者提出了允许重叠簇的Local ECC和Global ECC，以及考虑顶点异常值的Robust ECC。现有方法中，线性规划算法质量高但耗时，贪婪算法快速但质量低。本文旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 提出了一种结合线性规划和组合算法的框架，通过实验和理论分析验证其有效性。

Result: 算法在Local、Global和Robust ECC问题上均能高效生成高质量解，并补充了复杂性理论上的不可近似性结果和积分间隙界限。

Conclusion: 本文方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，回答了文献中的两个开放问题，并表明进一步的理论改进可能性较低。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in both machine learning and data mining.
Among various methods, edge-colored clustering (ECC) has emerged as a useful
approach for handling categorical data. Given a hypergraph with (hyper)edges
labeled by colors, ECC aims to assign vertex colors to minimize the number of
edges where the vertex color differs from the edge's color. However,
traditional ECC has inherent limitations, as it enforces a nonoverlapping and
exhaustive clustering. To tackle these limitations, three versions of ECC have
been studied: Local ECC and Global ECC, which allow overlapping clusters, and
Robust ECC, which accounts for vertex outliers. For these problems, both linear
programming (LP) rounding algorithms and greedy combinatorial algorithms have
been proposed. While these LP-rounding algorithms provide high-quality
solutions, they demand substantial computation time; the greedy algorithms, on
the other hand, run very fast but often compromise solution quality. In this
paper, we present an algorithmic framework that combines the strengths of LP
with the computational efficiency of combinatorial algorithms. Both
experimental and theoretical analyses show that our algorithms efficiently
produce high-quality solutions for all three problems: Local, Global, and
Robust ECC. We complement our algorithmic contributions with
complexity-theoretic inapproximability results and integrality gap bounds,
which suggest that significant theoretical improvements are unlikely. Our
results also answer two open questions previously raised in the literature.

Motivation: 现实决策问题中，源域和目标域的状态转移不同，传统DRMDP方法依赖于不确定性集的设计，而线性混合DRMDP框架能更精细地表示不确定性。

Method: 提出线性混合DRMDP框架，基于混合权重参数定义不确定性集，并设计了一种元算法用于鲁棒策略学习，分析了三种不同散度度量下的样本复杂度。

Result: 线性混合DRMDP框架在具有混合模型先验知识时，比传统方法提供了更精细的不确定性表示，并证明了其统计可学习性。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究提供了理论基础，展示了在动态不确定性建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems face the off-dynamics challenge: the
agent learns a policy in a source domain and deploys it in a target domain with
different state transitions. The distributionally robust Markov decision
process (DRMDP) addresses this challenge by finding a robust policy that
performs well under the worst-case environment within a pre-specified
uncertainty set of transition dynamics. Its effectiveness heavily hinges on the
proper design of these uncertainty sets, based on prior knowledge of the
dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel linear mixture DRMDP framework,
where the nominal dynamics is assumed to be a linear mixture model. In contrast
with existing uncertainty sets directly defined as a ball centered around the
nominal kernel, linear mixture DRMDPs define the uncertainty sets based on a
ball around the mixture weighting parameter. We show that this new framework
provides a more refined representation of uncertainties compared to
conventional models based on $(s,a)$-rectangularity and $d$-rectangularity,
when prior knowledge about the mixture model is present. We propose a meta
algorithm for robust policy learning in linear mixture DRMDPs with general
$f$-divergence defined uncertainty sets, and analyze its sample complexities
under three divergence metrics instantiations: total variation,
Kullback-Leibler, and $\chi^2$ divergences. These results establish the
statistical learnability of linear mixture DRMDPs, laying the theoretical
foundation for future research on this new setting.

Result: 在尖峰协方差模型中，RBM达到了最优计算弱恢复阈值，与BBP转变一致。

Conclusion: RBM在特定条件下具有理论可分析性，并展示了其性能的优越性。

Abstract: The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is one of the simplest generative
neural networks capable of learning input distributions. Despite its
simplicity, the analysis of its performance in learning from the training data
is only well understood in cases that essentially reduce to singular value
decomposition of the data. Here, we consider the limit of a large dimension of
the input space and a constant number of hidden units. In this limit, we
simplify the standard RBM training objective into a form that is equivalent to
the multi-index model with non-separable regularization. This opens a path to
analyze training of the RBM using methods that are established for multi-index
models, such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and its state evolution, and
the analysis of Gradient Descent (GD) via the dynamical mean-field theory. We
then give rigorous asymptotics of the training dynamics of RBM on data
generated by the spiked covariance model as a prototype of a structure suitable
for unsupervised learning. We show in particular that RBM reaches the optimal
computational weak recovery threshold, aligning with the BBP transition, in the
spiked covariance model.

Motivation: 研究如何在通信假设下为MDP设计一个具有渐近最优遗憾的学习算法。

Method: 算法通过显式跟踪常数K(M)来学习最优策略，并平衡探索、共同探索和利用的权衡。同时，提出了一种正则化机制来从经验数据中精确估计K(M)。

Result: 算法实现了K(M)log(T) + o(log(T))的遗憾，其中K(M)是最优常数。

Conclusion: 该算法在通信MDP中实现了渐近最优遗憾，并通过正则化机制解决了K(M)不连续性带来的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that achieves asymptotically
optimal regret for Markov decision processes in average reward under a
communicating assumption. That is, given a communicating Markov decision
process $M$, our algorithm has regret $K(M) \log(T) + \mathrm{o}(\log(T))$
where $T$ is the number of learning steps and $K(M)$ is the best possible
constant. This algorithm works by explicitly tracking the constant $K(M)$ to
learn optimally, then balances the trade-off between exploration (playing
sub-optimally to gain information), co-exploration (playing optimally to gain
information) and exploitation (playing optimally to score maximally). We
further show that the function $K(M)$ is discontinuous, which is a consequence
challenge for our approach. To that end, we describe a regularization mechanism
to estimate $K(M)$ with arbitrary precision from empirical data.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在推理时如何最大化答案准确率的同时控制计算预算（TCO）的问题。

Method: 提出Compute-Aware Tree Search（CATS）框架，动态控制搜索行为。通过actor-critic机制，actor输出采样超参数，critic评估其效用以指导预算分配。

Result: 在MATH和AIME基准测试中，CATS优于其他外部测试时推理方法，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: CATS框架通过动态控制搜索行为，显著提升了推理性能和计算效率，为LLMs的外部测试时推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: External test-time reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
decoupling generation and selection. At inference time, the model generates
multiple reasoning paths, and an auxiliary process reward model (PRM) is used
to score and select the best one. A central challenge in this setting is
test-time compute optimality (TCO), i.e., how to maximize answer accuracy under
a fixed inference budget. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to
analyze how the generalization error of the PRM affects compute efficiency and
reasoning performance. Leveraging PAC-Bayes theory, we derive generalization
bounds and show that a lower generalization error of PRM leads to fewer samples
required to find correct answers. Motivated by this analysis, we propose
Compute-Aware Tree Search (CATS), an actor-critic framework that dynamically
controls search behavior. The actor outputs sampling hyperparameters based on
reward distributions and sparsity statistics, while the critic estimates their
utility to guide budget allocation. Experiments on the MATH and AIME benchmarks
with various LLMs and PRMs demonstrate that CATS consistently outperforms other
external TTS methods, validating our theoretical predictions.

Motivation: 尽管SGD在机器学习中表现优异，但其与生物学习机制存在显著差异。论文旨在揭示两者之间的潜在联系，以弥合人工与生物学习之间的鸿沟。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究了SGD在权重衰减和噪声注入下的学习信号与Hebbian学习的关系。

Result: 发现SGD在正则化下表现出类似Hebbian学习的行为，而在噪声注入下则表现出反Hebbian行为。此外，任何学习规则（甚至随机规则）在权重衰减下都可能表现出Hebbian特性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明Hebbian特性可能是更深层优化原则的表现，提醒人们不要将其在神经数据中的存在简单解释为反对更复杂机制的证据。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has emerged as a remarkably effective
learning algorithm, underpinning nearly all state-of-the-art machine learning
models, from large language models to autonomous vehicles. Despite its
practical success, SGD appears fundamentally distinct from biological learning
mechanisms. It is widely believed that the biological brain can not implement
gradient descent because it is nonlocal, and we have found little (if any)
experimental evidence for it. In contrast, the brain is widely thought to learn
via local Hebbian learning principles, which have been seen as incompatible
with gradient descent. In this paper, we establish a theoretical and empirical
connection between the learning signals of neural networks trained using SGD
with weight decay and those trained with Hebbian learning near convergence. We
show that SGD with regularization can appear to learn according to a Hebbian
rule, and SGD with injected noise according to an anti-Hebbian rule. We also
provide empirical evidence that Hebbian learning properties can emerge in a
network with weight decay from virtually any learning rule--even random ones.
These results may bridge a long-standing gap between artificial and biological
learning, revealing Hebbian properties as an epiphenomenon of deeper
optimization principles and cautioning against interpreting their presence in
neural data as evidence against more complex hetero-synaptic mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该框架在同时处理测量不确定性和高维非线性动态的实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents AFD-STA Net, a neural framework integrating adaptive
filtering and spatiotemporal dynamics learning for predicting high-dimensional
chaotic systems governed by partial differential equations. The architecture
combines: 1) An adaptive exponential smoothing module with position-aware decay
coefficients for robust attractor reconstruction, 2) Parallel attention
mechanisms capturing cross-temporal and spatial dependencies, 3) Dynamic gated
fusion of multiscale features, and 4) Deep projection networks with
dimension-scaling capabilities. Numerical experiments on nonlinear PDE systems
demonstrate the model's effectiveness in maintaining prediction accuracy under
both smooth and strongly chaotic regimes while exhibiting noise tolerance
through adaptive filtering. Component ablation studies confirm critical
contributions from each module, particularly highlighting the essential role of
spatiotemporal attention in learning complex dynamical interactions. The
framework shows promising potential for real-world applications requiring
simultaneous handling of measurement uncertainties and high-dimensional
nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: 结论是前向模式MCMC算法在贝叶斯推断中具有竞争力，适用于层次分布和贝叶斯神经网络等模型。

Abstract: Recent work on backpropagation-free learning has shown that it is possible to
use forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) to perform optimization on
differentiable models. Forward-mode AD requires sampling a tangent vector for
each forward pass of a model. The result is the model evaluation with the
directional derivative along the tangent. In this paper, we illustrate how the
sampling of this tangent vector can be incorporated into the proposal mechanism
for the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). As such, we are the
first to introduce a backpropagation-free gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We also extend to a novel backpropagation-free
position-specific preconditioned forward-mode MALA that leverages Hessian
information. Overall, we propose four new algorithms: Forward MALA; Line
Forward MALA; Pre-conditioned Forward MALA, and Pre-conditioned Line Forward
MALA. We highlight the reduced computational cost of the forward-mode samplers
and show that forward-mode is competitive with the original MALA, while even
outperforming it depending on the probabilistic model. We include Bayesian
inference results on a range of probabilistic models, including hierarchical
distributions and Bayesian neural networks.

Abstract: The techniques of data-driven backmapping from coarse-grained (CG) to
fine-grained (FG) representation often struggle with accuracy, unstable
training, and physical realism, especially when applied to complex systems such
as proteins. In this work, we introduce a novel iterative framework by using
conditional Variational Autoencoders and graph-based neural networks,
specifically designed to tackle the challenges associated with such large-scale
biomolecules. Our method enables stepwise refinement from CG beads to full
atomistic details. We outline the theory of iterative generative backmapping
and demonstrate via numerical experiments the advantages of multistep schemes
by applying them to proteins of vastly different structures with very coarse
representations. This multistep approach not only improves the accuracy of
reconstructions but also makes the training process more computationally
efficient for proteins with ultra-CG representations.

Conclusion: 位置等变性和局部感受性是生成BC方法缝合能力的关键，简单架构改进可有效提升性能。

Abstract: In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together
sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse
behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement
learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown
proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly
understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably
stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties
are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local
receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and
inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion
planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling.
Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than
positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition,
both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple
architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive
methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based
guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable
generalization in goal-conditioned settings.

Conclusion: EEGNN通过动态调整计算深度，有效平衡了性能和效率，为GNN的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to halt inference as soon as
classification confidence is high enough, adaptively trading depth for
confidence, and thereby cutting latency and energy on easy inputs while
retaining full-depth accuracy for harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit
mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for
graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on
simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex
graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven
effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in
scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and
over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first
introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose
symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable
intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs.
Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks
(EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly
termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments
show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver
competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching
attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially
reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our
experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most
data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality
sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when
training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense
datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data
(arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit
phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through
controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped
data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical
value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the
biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost
nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly
memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity
allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack
problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation
across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio
varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and
reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing
ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings
highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not
be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as
evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based
on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have
generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing
momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the
dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art
approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing
diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The
inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally
with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition,
reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the
denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs
through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and
extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing
diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar
inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an
appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability
while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our
hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier
from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data
distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental
results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model
architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

catastrophic forgetting can significantly impair model efficacy. In this study,
we address OCL by introducing an innovative memory framework that incorporates
a short-term memory system to retain dynamic information and a long-term memory
system to archive enduring knowledge. Specifically, the long-term memory system
comprises a collection of sub-memory buffers, each linked to a cluster
prototype and designed to retain data samples from distinct categories. We
propose a novel $K$-means-based sample selection method to identify cluster
prototypes for each encountered category. To safeguard essential and critical
samples, we introduce a novel memory optimisation strategy that selectively
retains samples in the appropriate sub-memory buffer by evaluating each cluster
prototype against incoming samples through an optimal transportation mechanism.
This approach specifically promotes each sub-memory buffer to retain data
samples that exhibit significant discrepancies from the corresponding cluster
prototype, thereby ensuring the preservation of semantically rich information.
In addition, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer (DAC) approach that
formulates the memory updating as an optimisation problem and divides it into
several subproblems. As a result, the proposed DAC approach can solve these
subproblems separately and thus can significantly reduce computations of the
proposed memory updating process. We conduct a series of experiments across
standard and imbalanced learning settings, and the empirical findings indicate
that the proposed memory framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in
both learning contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开LLM基准测试可能导致未来模型被污染，现有方法需要信任单一组织且无法完全避免测试集过拟合。

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确检测多种基准测试、模型和训练方法中的数据污染。

Conclusion: 该方法有效防止基准测试答案泄露，同时提供数据污染检测手段。

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks
contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or
intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep
the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions
to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single
organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries.
To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without
completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still
maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject
randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and
only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the
best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is
this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach
also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully
capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this
ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data
contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data
contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training
methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络的训练面临非可微和离散优化问题，STE作为广泛使用的启发式方法，其理论性质尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在有限样本条件下。

Method: 通过分析具有二值权重和激活的两层神经网络的量化感知训练，利用压缩感知和动力系统理论工具，推导了STE的样本复杂度界限。

Result: 研究发现样本量对STE的成功至关重要，并在存在标签噪声的情况下，揭示了STE梯度方法的递归特性。

Conclusion: 本文为STE在有限样本条件下的理论分析提供了首个框架，揭示了其优化行为的关键特性。

Abstract: Training quantized neural networks requires addressing the non-differentiable
and discrete nature of the underlying optimization problem. To tackle this
challenge, the straight-through estimator (STE) has become the most widely
adopted heuristic, allowing backpropagation through discrete operations by
introducing surrogate gradients. However, its theoretical properties remain
largely unexplored, with few existing works simplifying the analysis by
assuming an infinite amount of training data. In contrast, this work presents
the first finite-sample analysis of STE in the context of neural network
quantization. Our theoretical results highlight the critical role of sample
size in the success of STE, a key insight absent from existing studies.
Specifically, by analyzing the quantization-aware training of a two-layer
neural network with binary weights and activations, we derive the sample
complexity bound in terms of the data dimensionality that guarantees the
convergence of STE-based optimization to the global minimum. Moreover, in the
presence of label noises, we uncover an intriguing recurrence property of
STE-gradient method, where the iterate repeatedly escape from and return to the
optimal binary weights. Our analysis leverages tools from compressed sensing
and dynamical systems theory.

Motivation: 挑战强化学习在自我改进中的主导地位，探索监督学习在无外部教师情况下通过负面反馈实现自主改进的可能性。

Method: 提出NFT方法，通过建模隐式负面策略，利用LLM自身生成的负面答案进行优化。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，NFT显著优于传统监督学习方法，甚至与领先的强化学习方法（如GRPO和DAPO）表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: NFT通过负面反馈填补了监督学习与强化学习在二元反馈学习系统中的差距，为LLM的自我改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of
LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier
signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such
verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference
answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the
prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose
Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to
reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers.
In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers,
NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy
is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive
data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct
experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently
show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT
significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning,
matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in
strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different
theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the
gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it
has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain
dominated by gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). However, recent
advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can
leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets,
particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language
model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods
utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their
effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with
Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable
transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture
free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and
takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed
to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks
of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits
scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further
performance improvements.

Motivation: RLHF常用于对齐语言模型与人类偏好，但存在奖励模型过优化问题，迭代RLHF的过优化动态尚不明确。

Method: 使用AlpacaFarm基准，系统分析奖励模型训练数据转移、奖励函数选择和策略初始化等设计选择。

Result: 过优化随迭代减少，奖励模型逐渐接近真实偏好；性能提升逐渐减弱；从基础策略重新初始化稳健但灵活性受限。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更稳定和通用的RLHF流程提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for
aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often
suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the
reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the
idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is
iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated
human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,
the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In
this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in
iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model
training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used
for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled
AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over
successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth
preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while
reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation
flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early
overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more
stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

Result: 实验证明该方法显著加速了MLP训练，并进一步通过优化样条节点位置提升了精度。

Conclusion: 通过KAN与MLPs的结构等价性，实现了MLP训练的高效优化，适用于回归和科学机器学习任务。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a workhorse machine learning architecture,
used in a variety of modern deep learning frameworks. However, recently
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have become increasingly popular due to their
success on a range of problems, particularly for scientific machine learning
tasks. In this paper, we exploit the relationship between KANs and multichannel
MLPs to gain structural insight into how to train MLPs faster. We demonstrate
the KAN basis (1) provides geometric localized support, and (2) acts as a
preconditioned descent in the ReLU basis, overall resulting in expedited
training and improved accuracy. Our results show the equivalence between
free-knot spline KAN architectures, and a class of MLPs that are refined
geometrically along the channel dimension of each weight tensor. We exploit
this structural equivalence to define a hierarchical refinement scheme that
dramatically accelerates training of the multi-channel MLP architecture. We
show further accuracy improvements can be had by allowing the $1$D locations of
the spline knots to be trained simultaneously with the weights. These advances
are demonstrated on a range of benchmark examples for regression and scientific
machine learning.

Motivation: 解决需要跨多尺度推理的现实问题，要求模型不仅能处理单点数据，还能处理整个分布。

Method: 通过将编码器作用于样本集，并用生成器替代解码器以匹配输入分布，结合条件生成模型和满足分布不变性准则的编码器网络。

Result: GDE在Wasserstein空间中学习预测充分统计量，并在合成数据集和计算生物学的六个关键问题中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GDE框架在分布表示学习和实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Many real-world problems require reasoning across multiple scales, demanding
models which operate not on single data points, but on entire distributions. We
introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts
autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of
samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the
input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of
distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks
which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs
learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such
that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent
interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for
Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs
against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently
stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational
biology: learning representations of cell populations from lineage-tracing data
(150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on single-cell transcriptomes (1M
cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell
images), modeling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns (253M sequences),
designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal
modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).

Result: Discovery Engine提供了一种压缩的科学领域表示，支持AI代理直接操作以发现非显性联系和生成新知识。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI增强的科学研究和加速发现提供了新范式。

Abstract: The prevailing model for disseminating scientific knowledge relies on
individual publications dispersed across numerous journals and archives. This
legacy system is ill suited to the recent exponential proliferation of
publications, contributing to insurmountable information overload, issues
surrounding reproducibility and retractions. We introduce the Discovery Engine,
a framework to address these challenges by transforming an array of
disconnected literature into a unified, computationally tractable
representation of a scientific domain. Central to our approach is the
LLM-driven distillation of publications into structured "knowledge artifacts,"
instances of a universal conceptual schema, complete with verifiable links to
source evidence. These artifacts are then encoded into a high-dimensional
Conceptual Tensor. This tensor serves as the primary, compressed representation
of the synthesized field, where its labeled modes index scientific components
(concepts, methods, parameters, relations) and its entries quantify their
interdependencies. The Discovery Engine allows dynamic "unrolling" of this
tensor into human-interpretable views, such as explicit knowledge graphs (the
CNM graph) or semantic vector spaces, for targeted exploration. Crucially, AI
agents operate directly on the graph using abstract mathematical and learned
operations to navigate the knowledge landscape, identify non-obvious
connections, pinpoint gaps, and assist researchers in generating novel
knowledge artifacts (hypotheses, designs). By converting literature into a
structured tensor and enabling agent-based interaction with this compact
representation, the Discovery Engine offers a new paradigm for AI-augmented
scientific inquiry and accelerated discovery.

Conclusion: 通过图结构和引导项的引入，该方法能够高效生成真实且多样的多人交互，无需专门训练多人模型。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motion with high-level controls is a crucial task
for social understanding, robotics, and animation. With high-quality MOCAP data
becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have
been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a
less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction
Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person
interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as
motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person
interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate
complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person
interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose
the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation
conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as
interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we
introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling
scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality
multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of
two-person and multi-person interactions.

Conclusion: WonderPlay结合了物理模拟的精确性和扩散视频生成的表现力，实现了直观的用户控制。

Abstract: WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video
generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single
image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic
dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a
wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics
solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video
generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated
video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop
between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables
intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of
physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video
generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to
interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow,
liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models, despite their broad capabilities,
often struggle with specialized domain knowledge, a limitation particularly
pronounced in more accessible, lower-parameter versions. This gap hinders their
deployment as effective agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building
on our prior work with AstroSage-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-70B, a
significantly larger and more advanced domain-specialized natural-language AI
assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy,
astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical
instrumentation. Developed from the Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-70B
underwent extensive continued pre-training on a vast corpus of astronomical
literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning and model merging. Beyond its
70-billion parameter scale, this model incorporates refined datasets,
judiciously chosen learning hyperparameters, and improved training procedures,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex astronomical tasks. Notably,
we integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-70B to
either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable
thought process. Evaluated on the AstroMLab-1 benchmark -- comprising 4,425
questions from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-70B achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses all other tested open-weight and
proprietary models, including leading systems like o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen-3-235B, even those with API costs two
orders of magnitude higher. This work demonstrates that domain specialization,
when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist
counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing
the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.

Abstract: In this second installment of the Alpay Algebra framework, I formally define
identity as a fixed point that emerges through categorical recursion. Building
upon the transfinite operator $\varphi^\infty$, I characterize identity as the
universal solution to a self-referential functorial equation over a small
cartesian closed category. I prove the existence and uniqueness of such
identity-fixed-points via ordinal-indexed iteration, and interpret their
convergence through internal categorical limits. Functors, adjunctions, and
morphisms are reconstructed as dynamic traces of evolving states governed by
$\varphi$, reframing identity not as a static label but as a stabilized
process. Through formal theorems and symbolic flows, I show how these fixed
points encode symbolic memory, recursive coherence, and semantic invariance.
This paper positions identity as a mathematical structure that arises from
within the logic of change itself computable, convergent, and categorically
intrinsic.

Abstract: Recently, many approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), have been proposed to further enrich Large Language
Models' (LLMs) complex problem-solving capacities in reasoning scenarios.
However, these methods may fail to solve complex problems due to the lack of
ability to find optimal solutions. Swarm Intelligence has been serving as a
powerful tool for finding optima in the field of traditional optimization
problems. To this end, we propose integrating swarm intelligence into the
reasoning process by introducing a novel Agent-based Swarm Intelligence (ASI)
paradigm. In this paradigm, we formulate LLM reasoning as an optimization
problem and use a swarm intelligence scheme to guide a group of LLM-based
agents in collaboratively searching for optimal solutions. To avoid swarm
intelligence getting trapped in local optima, we further develop a Swarm
Intelligence Enhancing Reasoning (SIER) framework, which develops a
density-driven strategy to enhance the reasoning ability. To be specific, we
propose to perform kernel density estimation and non-dominated sorting to
optimize both solution quality and diversity simultaneously. In this case, SIER
efficiently enhances solution space exploration through expanding the diversity
of the reasoning path. Besides, a step-level quality evaluation is used to help
agents improve solution quality by correcting low-quality intermediate steps.
Then, we use quality thresholds to dynamically control the termination of
exploration and the selection of candidate steps, enabling a more flexible and
efficient reasoning process. Extensive experiments are ...

methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the
complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and
source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In
contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five
specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted
repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an
Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for
generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating
outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually
evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of
misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation
lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability,
modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system
overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs,
and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction
at scale.

TL;DR: DailyQA是一个动态数据集，每周更新问题，利用维基百科修订日志自动生成问题与答案，用于评估大语言模型处理时效性信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在处理快速变化的事实性数据和多领域问题时的表现，探索其在时效性信息处理中的挑战。

Method: 通过维基百科修订日志构建自动化数据管道，包括数据过滤、查询生成、质量检查、答案提取和查询分类，并评估不同RAG管道下开源与闭源LLM的表现。

Result: 研究发现，LLM在处理时效性信息时仍面临显著挑战，且检索结果的重新排序对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: DailyQA为LLM和RAG系统的进步方向提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We propose DailyQA, an automatically updated dynamic dataset that updates
questions weekly and contains answers to questions on any given date. DailyQA
utilizes daily updates from Wikipedia revision logs to implement a fully
automated pipeline of data filtering, query generation synthesis, quality
checking, answer extraction, and query classification. The benchmark requires
large language models (LLMs) to process and answer questions involving
fast-changing factual data and covering multiple domains. We evaluate several
open-source and closed-source LLMs using different RAG pipelines with web
search augmentation. We compare the ability of different models to process
time-sensitive web information and find that rerank of web retrieval results is
critical. Our results indicate that LLMs still face significant challenges in
handling frequently updated information, suggesting that DailyQA benchmarking
provides valuable insights into the direction of progress for LLMs and RAG
systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: BehaveGPT是一种基于Transformer架构的基础模型，专注于大规模用户行为预测。通过新颖的预训练范式，它在多种下游任务中表现优异，性能超越现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在语言和视觉领域取得显著进展，但用户行为建模仍面临数据复杂性和时空关系捕捉的挑战。

Method: 采用Transformer架构和DRO-based预训练范式，专注于学习复杂行为模式，支持多种下游任务。

Result: 在真实数据集上，BehaveGPT性能优于现有基线，宏召回率和加权召回率提升超过10%。

Conclusion: BehaveGPT有效解决了用户行为建模的挑战，首次在用户行为领域验证了扩展规律。

Abstract: In recent years, foundational models have revolutionized the fields of
language and vision, demonstrating remarkable abilities in understanding and
generating complex data; however, similar advances in user behavior modeling
have been limited, largely due to the complexity of behavioral data and the
challenges involved in capturing intricate temporal and contextual
relationships in user activities. To address this, we propose BehaveGPT, a
foundational model designed specifically for large-scale user behavior
prediction. Leveraging transformer-based architecture and a novel pretraining
paradigm, BehaveGPT is trained on vast user behavior datasets, allowing it to
learn complex behavior patterns and support a range of downstream tasks,
including next behavior prediction, long-term generation, and cross-domain
adaptation. Our approach introduces the DRO-based pretraining paradigm tailored
for user behavior data, which improves model generalization and transferability
by equitably modeling both head and tail behaviors. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving more than a 10% improvement in macro and weighted recall,
showcasing its ability to effectively capture and predict user behavior.
Furthermore, we measure the scaling law in the user behavior domain for the
first time on the Honor dataset, providing insights into how model performance
scales with increased data and parameter sizes.

Motivation: 现代搜索系统虽然采用了深度学习和LLM技术，但仍可能因模型不可预测性、元数据错误或设计缺陷而返回不相关或不适当的内容，影响用户信任和业务目标。

Method: 引入一个额外的LLM监控层，用于标记用户无意搜索的内容，作为产品质量保障的基线，并通过反馈优化初始搜索机制。

Result: 该方法能够更准确地识别和过滤不相关或不适当的内容，提升搜索结果的可靠性和安全性。

Conclusion: LLM监控层是一种有效的补充手段，能够改善搜索系统的内容审核能力，从而提升用户体验和业务成果。

Abstract: Millions of people rely on search functionality to find and explore content
on entertainment platforms. Modern search systems use a combination of
candidate generation and ranking approaches, with advanced methods leveraging
deep learning and LLM-based techniques to retrieve, generate, and categorize
search results. Despite these advancements, search algorithms can still surface
inappropriate or irrelevant content due to factors like model unpredictability,
metadata errors, or overlooked design flaws. Such issues can misalign with
product goals and user expectations, potentially harming user trust and
business outcomes. In this work, we introduce an additional monitoring layer
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance content moderation. This
additional layer flags content if the user did not intend to search for it.
This approach serves as a baseline for product quality assurance, with
collected feedback used to refine the initial retrieval mechanisms of the
search model, ensuring a safer and more reliable user experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM与CRM结合时存在高推理成本和静态知识迁移问题，需动态双向优化方法。

Method: 通过样本自适应加权和输出分布对齐，实现LLM与CRM的双向知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明LLMD4Rec在多个基准上显著提升推荐准确性，且不增加推理成本。

Conclusion: LLMD4Rec为LLM和CRM结合提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
understanding and generating semantic patterns, making them promising
candidates for sequential recommendation tasks. However, when combined with
conventional recommendation models (CRMs), LLMs often face challenges related
to high inference costs and static knowledge transfer methods. In this paper,
we propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters
dynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based
recommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods,
LLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models,
enhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with
collaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise
adaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates
the need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec
significantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks
without increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and
efficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in
sequential recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 本文从二次神经网络（QNN）的角度重新审视Hadamard乘积（HP），揭示其有效性原因，并提出改进方法，最终提出新型神经元格式QNN-alpha，在CTR预测任务中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Hadamard乘积在CTR预测任务中有效性的原因，并通过QNN理论分析改进其性能。

Method: 通过理论分析和25种QNN神经元格式的实证评估，提出Multi-Head Khatri-Rao Product替代HP，并设计Self-Ensemble Loss增强性能。

Result: QNN-alpha在六个公开数据集上实现最佳性能，同时保持低推理延迟和良好兼容性。

Conclusion: QNN-alpha为CTR预测任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Hadamard Product (HP) has long been a cornerstone in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to capture
feature interactions without additional parameters. However, the underlying
reasons for its effectiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we revisit HP from
the perspective of Quadratic Neural Networks (QNN), which leverage quadratic
interaction terms to model complex feature relationships. We further reveal
QNN's ability to expand the feature space and provide smooth nonlinear
approximations without relying on activation functions. Meanwhile, we find that
traditional post-activation does not further improve the performance of the
QNN. Instead, mid-activation is a more suitable alternative. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of 25 QNN neuron formats, we
identify a good-performing variant and make further enhancements on it.
Specifically, we propose the Multi-Head Khatri-Rao Product as a superior
alternative to HP and a Self-Ensemble Loss with dynamic ensemble capability
within the same network to enhance computational efficiency and performance.
Ultimately, we propose a novel neuron format, QNN-alpha, which is tailored for
CTR prediction tasks. Experimental results show that QNN-alpha achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on six public datasets while maintaining low
inference latency, good scalability, and excellent compatibility. The code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究子模和超模集函数的平均值的优化问题，扩展了经典问题，并针对新应用提出了更通用的框架。

Method: 通过强多项式时间归约将DSS、SFM、USSS、UDSS和MNP问题联系起来，并利用Fujishige-Wolfe算法和SuperGreedy++作为通用求解器。

Result: 理论证明了SuperGreedy++的广泛有效性，实验验证了通用优化方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过适当框架，通用优化技术可以高效解决子模和超模比率问题，并达到最先进水平。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing or maximizing the average value $ f(S)/|S|
$ of a submodular or supermodular set function $ f: 2^V \to \mathbb{R} $ over
non-empty subsets $ S \subseteq V $. This generalizes classical problems such
as Densest Subgraph (DSG), Densest Supermodular Set (DSS), and Submodular
Function Minimization (SFM). Motivated by recent applications, we introduce two
broad formulations: Unrestricted Sparsest Submodular Set (USSS) and
Unrestricted Densest Supermodular Set (UDSS), which allow for negative and
non-monotone functions.
  We show that DSS, SFM, USSS, UDSS, and the Minimum Norm Point (MNP) problem
are equivalent under strongly polynomial-time reductions, enabling algorithmic
crossover. In particular, viewing these through the lens of the MNP in the base
polyhedron, we connect Fujishige's theory with dense decomposition, and show
that both Fujishige-Wolfe's algorithm and the heuristic \textsc{SuperGreedy++}
act as universal solvers for all these problems, including sub-modular function
minimization.
  Theoretically, we explain why \textsc{SuperGreedy++} is effective beyond DSS,
including for tasks like submodular minimization and minimum $ s $-$ t $ cut.
Empirically, we test several solvers, including the Fujishige-Wolfe algorithm
on over 400 experiments across seven problem types and large-scale
real/synthetic datasets. Surprisingly, general-purpose convex and flow-based
methods outperform task-specific baselines, demonstrating that with the right
framing, general optimization techniques can be both scalable and
state-of-the-art for submodular and supermodular ratio problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度的程序修复方法（GBPR），将程序修复问题转化为可微分数值程序空间中的连续优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于符号搜索的程序修复方法无法直接推理程序行为，限制了修复效果。

Method: 通过将符号程序编译为可微分的数值表示，在数值程序空间中进行基于梯度的优化搜索。

Result: 实验表明，GBPR能有效修复错误程序，并展示了清晰的修复轨迹。

Conclusion: GBPR为程序修复研究开辟了新方向，将连续优化与程序行为推理相结合。

Abstract: Automatic program repair seeks to generate correct code from buggy programs,
with most approaches searching the correct program in a discrete, symbolic
space of source code tokens. This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by
its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce
Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program
repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space.
Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical
representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided
by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of
1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical
representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair
buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program
space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first
to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program
space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research,
bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.

TL;DR: GenAI对人类创造力的影响：Meta分析显示，GenAI与人类创造力无显著差异，但人类使用GenAI时创造力显著提升，但多样性降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GenAI对创造力的影响，探讨其是否能生成创意及支持人类生成多样且创意的想法。

Method: 通过系统文献搜索筛选28项研究（8214名参与者），计算Hedges' g效应量，比较GenAI、人类及人类与GenAI协作的创造力和多样性表现。

Result: GenAI与人类创造力无显著差异（g=-0.05），人类使用GenAI时创造力显著提升（g=0.27），但多样性显著降低（g=-0.86）。

Conclusion: GenAI是支持而非替代人类创造力的工具，特别适用于需要创意支持的任务。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used to support a
wide range of human tasks, yet empirical evidence on its effect on creativity
remains scattered. Can GenAI generate ideas that are creative? To what extent
can it support humans in generating ideas that are both creative and diverse?
In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of GenAI on
the performance in creative tasks. For this, we first perform a systematic
literature search, based on which we identify n = 28 relevant studies (m = 8214
participants) for inclusion in our meta-analysis. We then compute standardized
effect sizes based on Hedges' g. We compare different outcomes: (i) how
creative GenAI is; (ii) how creative humans augmented by GenAI are; and (iii)
the diversity of ideas by humans augmented by GenAI. Our results show no
significant difference in creative performance between GenAI and humans (g =
-0.05), while humans collaborating with GenAI significantly outperform those
working without assistance (g = 0.27). However, GenAI has a significant
negative effect on the diversity of ideas for such collaborations between
humans and GenAI (g = -0.86). We further analyze heterogeneity across different
GenAI models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), different tasks (e.g., creative writing,
ideation, divergent thinking), and different participant populations (e.g.,
laypeople, business, academia). Overall, our results position GenAI as an
augmentative tool that can support, rather than replace, human
creativity-particularly in tasks benefiting from ideation support.

Result: 实验显示GUI代理在动态环境中的接地准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: TransBench展示了GUI代理在真实动态环境中的实用潜力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, which autonomously operate on digital
interfaces through natural language instructions, hold transformative potential
for accessibility, automation, and user experience. A critical aspect of their
functionality is grounding - the ability to map linguistic intents to visual
and structural interface elements. However, existing GUI agents often struggle
to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital
environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications
while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce
TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance
the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version
transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability
(generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and
cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally
distinct apps). TransBench includes 15 app categories with diverse
functionalities, capturing essential pages across versions and platforms to
enable robust evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in grounding accuracy, showcasing the practical utility of GUI agents in
dynamic, real-world environments. Our code and data will be publicly available
at Github.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估当前视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务中是否能够模拟人类行为。

Method: 方法包括对八个视觉语言模型进行六项数据可视化素养评估，并与人类参与者对比。

Result: 结果显示模型表现平均低于人类，且错误模式与人类显著不同。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要进一步开发更接近人类推理的人工系统。

Abstract: Data visualizations are powerful tools for communicating patterns in
quantitative data. Yet understanding any data visualization is no small feat --
succeeding requires jointly making sense of visual, numerical, and linguistic
inputs arranged in a conventionalized format one has previously learned to
parse. Recently developed vision-language models are, in principle, promising
candidates for developing computational models of these cognitive operations.
However, it is currently unclear to what degree these models emulate human
behavior on tasks that involve reasoning about data visualizations. This gap
reflects limitations in prior work that has evaluated data visualization
understanding in artificial systems using measures that differ from those
typically used to assess these abilities in humans. Here we evaluated eight
vision-language models on six data visualization literacy assessments designed
for humans and compared model responses to those of human participants. We
found that these models performed worse than human participants on average, and
this performance gap persisted even when using relatively lenient criteria to
assess model performance. Moreover, while relative performance across items was
somewhat correlated between models and humans, all models produced patterns of
errors that were reliably distinct from those produced by human participants.
Taken together, these findings suggest significant opportunities for further
development of artificial systems that might serve as useful models of how
humans reason about data visualizations. All code and data needed to reproduce

Method: 构建包含36个图表的基准数据集，由众包工作者评估七个体验因素，并测试MLLMs在直接预测和成对比较任务中的表现。

Result: MLLMs在评估单个图表时不如人类敏感，但在成对比较中表现准确可靠。

Conclusion: MLLMs在图表感知任务中具有潜力，但需进一步验证和改进。

Abstract: The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made remarkable
progress in visual understanding tasks, presenting a vast opportunity to
predict the perceptual and emotional impact of charts. However, it also raises
concerns, as many applications of LLMs are based on overgeneralized assumptions
from a few examples, lacking sufficient validation of their performance and
effectiveness. We introduce Chart-to-Experience, a benchmark dataset comprising
36 charts, evaluated by crowdsourced workers for their impact on seven
experiential factors. Using the dataset as ground truth, we evaluated
capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on two tasks: direct prediction and
pairwise comparison of charts. Our findings imply that MLLMs are not as
sensitive as human evaluators when assessing individual charts, but are
accurate and reliable in pairwise comparisons.

Abstract: Despite the growing promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting
decision-making across domains, fostering appropriate human reliance on AI
remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate the utility of
exploring distance-based uncertainty scores for task delegation to AI and
describe how these scores can be visualized through embedding representations
for human-AI decision-making. After developing an AI-based system for physical
stroke rehabilitation assessment, we conducted a study with 19 health
professionals and 10 students in medicine/health to understand the effect of
exploring distance-based uncertainty scores on users' reliance on AI. Our
findings showed that distance-based uncertainty scores outperformed traditional
probability-based uncertainty scores in identifying uncertain cases. In
addition, after exploring confidence scores for task delegation and reviewing
embedding-based visualizations of distance-based uncertainty scores,
participants achieved an 8.20% higher rate of correct decisions, a 7.15% higher
rate of changing their decisions to correct ones, and a 7.14% lower rate of
incorrect changes after reviewing AI outputs than those reviewing
probability-based uncertainty scores ($p<0.01$). Our findings highlight the
potential of distance-based uncertainty scores to enhance decision accuracy and
appropriate reliance on AI while discussing ongoing challenges for human-AI
collaborative decision-making.

Conclusion: 结合结构化记忆和LLM推理，LiloDriver实现了可扩展、类人的运动规划，适用于现实自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving research towards motion planners that
are robust, safe, and adaptive. However, existing rule-based and data-driven
planners lack adaptability to long-tail scenarios, while knowledge-driven
methods offer strong reasoning but face challenges in representation, control,
and real-world evaluation. To address these challenges, we present LiloDriver,
a lifelong learning framework for closed-loop motion planning in long-tail
autonomous driving scenarios. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with
a memory-augmented planner generation system, LiloDriver continuously adapts to
new scenarios without retraining. It features a four-stage architecture
including perception, scene encoding, memory-based strategy refinement, and
LLM-guided reasoning. Evaluated on the nuPlan benchmark, LiloDriver achieves
superior performance in both common and rare driving scenarios, outperforming
static rule-based and learning-based planners. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of combining structured memory and LLM reasoning to enable
scalable, human-like motion planning in real-world autonomous driving. Our code

Result: 在模拟和真实世界的长时程操作任务中，基于HD-Space的数据显著提升了策略性能。

Conclusion: HD-Space通过优化数据质量，能够用少量演示数据训练更强大的策略，为数据质量和规模优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with human demonstrations is a promising method for
robotic manipulation tasks. While minimal demonstrations enable robotic action
execution, achieving high success rates and generalization requires high cost,
e.g., continuously adding data or incrementally conducting human-in-loop
processes with complex hardware/software systems. In this paper, we rethink the
state/action space of the data collection pipeline as well as the underlying
factors responsible for the prediction of non-robust actions. To this end, we
introduce a Hierarchical Data Collection Space (HD-Space) for robotic imitation
learning, a simple data collection scheme, endowing the model to train with
proactive and high-quality data. Specifically, We segment the fine manipulation
task into multiple key atomic tasks from a high-level perspective and design
atomic state/action spaces for human demonstrations, aiming to generate robust
IL data. We conduct empirical evaluations across two simulated and five
real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks and demonstrate that IL policy
training with HD-Space-based data can achieve significantly enhanced policy
performance. HD-Space allows the use of a small amount of demonstration data to
train a more powerful policy, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks.
We aim for HD-Space to offer insights into optimizing data quality and guiding

### [415] [Dynamic Manipulation of Deformable Objects in 3D: Simulation, Benchmark and Learning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17434)
*Guanzhou Lan,Yuqi Yang,Anup Teejo Mathew,Feiping Nie,Rong Wang,Xuelong Li,Federico Renda,Bin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于降阶动力学的仿真框架和基准，用于解决3D目标导向的绳索操纵问题，并提出了Dynamics Informed Diffusion Policy (DIDP)框架，结合模仿预训练和物理信息测试时适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标导向的动态操纵在复杂系统动力学和严格任务约束下具有挑战性，尤其是高自由度和欠驱动的可变形物体场景。现有方法多限于低速或2D设置，难以适用于真实3D任务。

Method: 提出DIDP框架，包括降阶空间中的扩散策略学习和物理信息测试时适应方案，确保操纵执行的可靠性和一致性。

Result: 实验验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性，展示了学习策略的优异性能。

Conclusion: DIDP框架通过结合模仿学习和物理信息适应，有效解决了3D绳索操纵问题，为复杂动态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation is inherently challenging due to
complex system dynamics and stringent task constraints, particularly in
deformable object scenarios characterized by high degrees of freedom and
underactuation. Prior methods often simplify the problem to low-speed or 2D
settings, limiting their applicability to real-world 3D tasks. In this work, we
explore 3D goal-conditioned rope manipulation as a representative challenge. To
mitigate data scarcity, we introduce a novel simulation framework and benchmark
grounded in reduced-order dynamics, which enables compact state representation
and facilitates efficient policy learning. Building on this, we propose
Dynamics Informed Diffusion Policy (DIDP), a framework that integrates
imitation pretraining with physics-informed test-time adaptation. First, we
design a diffusion policy that learns inverse dynamics within the reduced-order
space, enabling imitation learning to move beyond na\"ive data fitting and
capture the underlying physical structure. Second, we propose a
physics-informed test-time adaptation scheme that imposes kinematic boundary
conditions and structured dynamics priors on the diffusion process, ensuring
consistency and reliability in manipulation execution. Extensive experiments
validate the proposed approach, demonstrating strong performance in terms of
accuracy and robustness in the learned policy.

*Haotian Liu,Yuchuang Tong,Zhengtao Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双Transformer的机器人轨迹预测模型（DTRT），用于物理人机协作（pHRC）中准确预测人类意图并动态调整机器人行为，提升协作效率与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖短期运动数据，缺乏多步预测能力，难以感知意图变化并动态调整人机角色分配，导致潜在的不匹配问题。

Method: DTRT采用分层架构，结合人类引导的运动和力数据，利用两个基于Transformer的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）进行意图估计，并通过微分合作博弈论（DCGT）动态调整机器人行为。

Result: 实验表明，DTRT能准确预测人类意图并实现高效协作，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTRT通过结合人类动力学和长期预测，提升了意图理解的准确性，实现了自主且灵活的机器人协作。

Abstract: In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), accurate human intent
estimation and rational human-robot role allocation are crucial for safe and
efficient assistance. Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for
intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their
ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments
autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we
propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a
hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data
to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory
predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration.
Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based
Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data
in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle
avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is
employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring
robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing
an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation,
achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's
accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多尺度全局密集图卷积网络（GCN）和步态非线性周期性动态学习模块的新方法，用于个性化步态识别，以提升外骨骼辅助治疗的精准控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化步态可能导致患者不适或受伤，因此个性化步态对外骨骼机器人的适应性、舒适性和康复效果至关重要。

Method: 采用多尺度全局密集GCN捕捉空间域中的关节协同模式，并结合步态非线性周期性动态学习模块提取时域中的周期性特征。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在数据集上达到94.34%的准确率，比现有最佳方法提升3.77%。

Conclusion: 该方法为外骨骼辅助治疗中的个性化步态控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current exoskeleton control methods often face challenges in delivering
personalized treatment. Standardized walking gaits can lead to patient
discomfort or even injury. Therefore, personalized gait is essential for the
effectiveness of exoskeleton robots, as it directly impacts their adaptability,
comfort, and rehabilitation outcomes for individual users. To enable
personalized treatment in exoskeleton-assisted therapy and related
applications, accurate recognition of personal gait is crucial for implementing
tailored gait control. The key challenge in gait recognition lies in
effectively capturing individual differences in subtle gait features caused by
joint synergy, such as step frequency and step length. To tackle this issue, we
propose a novel approach, which uses Multi-Scale Global Dense Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN) in the spatial domain to identify latent joint
synergy patterns. Moreover, we propose a Gait Non-linear Periodic Dynamics
Learning module to effectively capture the periodic characteristics of gait in
the temporal domain. To support our individual gait recognition task, we have
constructed a comprehensive gait dataset that ensures both completeness and
reliability. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an
impressive accuracy of 94.34% on this dataset, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 3.77%. This advancement underscores the potential of
our approach to enhance personalized gait control in exoskeleton-assisted
therapy.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的文本到程序框架，用于处理非标准化的历史地籍数据，并以威尼斯1740-1808年为例，展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地籍数据因格式多样和人工标注而难以标准化，阻碍了大规模分析。研究旨在通过技术手段解决这一问题，揭示威尼斯关键历史时期的城市组织变迁。

Method: 采用文本到SQL和文本到Python两种互补技术，将自然语言查询转化为可执行代码，并提出了基于问题复杂度的分类法。

Result: 系统成功重建了威尼斯过去的人口信息、财产特征和时空对比，并通过可验证的程序输出确保了结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理复杂历史地籍数据提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，适用于类似研究场景。

Abstract: Cadastral data reveal key information about the historical organization of
cities but are often non-standardized due to diverse formats and human
annotations, complicating large-scale analysis. We explore as a case study
Venice's urban history during the critical period from 1740 to 1808, capturing
the transition following the fall of the ancient Republic and the Ancien
R\'egime. This era's complex cadastral data, marked by its volume and lack of
uniform structure, presents unique challenges that our approach adeptly
navigates, enabling us to generate spatial queries that bridge past and present
urban landscapes. We present a text-to-programs framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language queries into executable
code for processing historical cadastral records. Our methodology implements
two complementary techniques: a text-to-SQL approach for handling structured
queries about specific cadastral information, and a text-to-Python approach for
complex analytical operations requiring custom data manipulation. We propose a
taxonomy that classifies historical research questions based on their
complexity and analytical requirements, mapping them to the most appropriate
technical approach. This framework is supported by an investigation into the
execution consistency of the system, alongside a qualitative analysis of the
answers it produces. By ensuring interpretability and minimizing hallucination
through verifiable program outputs, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness
in reconstructing past population information, property features, and
spatiotemporal comparisons in Venice.

*Mohammad Kasra Habib,Daniel Graziotin,Stefan Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReqBrain是一种基于微调LLM的AI辅助工具，用于自动生成和分类软件需求，显著提升需求获取和规范的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件工程中，需求获取和规范过程劳动密集且易出错，LLM的潜力尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 通过微调5个7B参数的LLM，选择最佳模型Zephyr-7b-beta，并利用高质量数据集生成需求。

Result: Zephyr-7b-beta在BERT评分中达到89.30%，FRUGAL评分91.20，生成的需求真实且充分。

Conclusion: 微调的生成式AI可改进需求工程，未来可扩展至缺陷识别、测试用例生成等领域。

Abstract: Requirements elicitation and specification remains a labor-intensive, manual
process prone to inconsistencies and gaps, presenting a significant challenge
in modern software engineering. Emerging studies underscore the potential of
employing large language models (LLMs) for automated requirements generation to
support requirements elicitation and specification; however, it remains unclear
how to implement this effectively. In this work, we introduce ReqBrain, an
Al-assisted tool that employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate authentic and
adequate software requirements. Software engineers can engage with ReqBrain
through chat-based sessions to automatically generate software requirements and
categorize them by type. We curated a high-quality dataset of ISO
29148-compliant requirements and fine-tuned five 7B-parameter LLMs to determine
the most effective base model for ReqBrain. The top-performing model,
Zephyr-7b-beta, achieved 89.30\% Fl using the BERT score and a FRUGAL score of
91.20 in generating authentic and adequate requirements. Human evaluations
further confirmed ReqBrain's effectiveness in generating requirements. Our
findings suggest that generative Al, when fine-tuned, has the potential to
improve requirements elicitation and specification, paving the way for future
extensions into areas such as defect identification, test case generation, and
agile user story creation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化代码审查方法，解决了现有方法忽略仓库上下文和实际缺陷检测的问题，通过代码切片、多角色LLM框架等技术，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化代码审查方法过于简化，忽略了仓库上下文和实际缺陷检测，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出代码切片算法、多角色LLM框架、过滤机制和新型提示设计，解决上下文提取、关键缺陷包含、误报率降低和人工流程整合问题。

Result: 在真实合并请求上验证，性能比标准LLM提升2倍，比基线提升10倍。

Conclusion: 框架设计基于语言无关原则（如AST分析），具有广泛适用潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review
comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as
snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics
like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world
merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To
address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online
recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users,
analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of
lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context,
2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and
4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing
algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a
filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better
human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from
historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a
10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the
underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g.,
AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了GPT、Claude、Gemini和DeepSeek四种大型语言模型在生成功能性规范（如用例、业务规则和协作工作流）时的表现。结果显示，Claude生成的内容最完整但冗余，Gemini更精确，而所有模型在生成业务规则时表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在软件工程中生成功能性规范的能力，以帮助开发者更高效地完成开发任务。

Method: 通过案例研究，比较四种LLM在生成Mess管理系统的功能性规范时的表现，评估其语法、语义正确性、一致性、非歧义性和完整性。

Result: Claude生成的规范最完整但冗余，Gemini更精确；所有模型在生成业务规则时表现不佳，DeepSeek生成的规则最多但完整性较低。

Conclusion: LLM能够生成语法和语义正确的规范，但在一致性和完整性上存在差异，Claude和Gemini表现较好，但需进一步优化业务规则生成能力。

Abstract: Like any other discipline, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
impacted software engineering by helping developers generate the required
artifacts across various phases of software development. This paper presents a
case study comparing the performance of popular LLMs GPT, Claude, Gemini, and
DeepSeek in generating functional specifications that include use cases,
business rules, and collaborative workflows for a web application, the Mess
Management System. The study evaluated the quality of LLM generated use cases,
business rules, and collaborative workflows in terms of their syntactic and
semantic correctness, consistency, non ambiguity, and completeness compared to
the reference specifications against the zero-shot prompted problem statement.
Our results suggested that all four LLMs can specify syntactically and
semantically correct, mostly non-ambiguous artifacts. Still, they may be
inconsistent at times and may differ significantly in the completeness of the
generated specification. Claude and Gemini generated all the reference use
cases, with Claude achieving the most complete but somewhat redundant use case
specifications. Similar results were obtained for specifying workflows.
However, all four LLMs struggled to generate relevant Business Rules, with
DeepSeek generating the most reference rules but with less completeness.
Overall, Claude generated more complete specification artifacts, while Gemini
was more precise in the specifications it generated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着交通电气化和分散式可再生能源发电的普及，管理可再生能源社区（REC）的复杂性增加，尤其是电动汽车充电与建筑能源系统的集成面临诸多挑战。

Method: 采用基于MADDPG的多智能体控制策略EnergAIze，解决实际部署中的数据不完整、异构子系统集成、用户行为建模等问题。

Result: 在真实REC中的实验显示，框架平均降低9%的日峰值需求和5%的能源成本。

Conclusion: 该框架有效弥合了仿真与现实的差距，为REC中的智能能源管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of
decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing
Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging
with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning
(HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant
opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms,
have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control
strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments
faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration
of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant
behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper
introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and
bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a
MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses
challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user
behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational
REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of
our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5%
decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging
behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing
the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.

Result: 在合成任务中验证了架构的选择性性能，表现与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了控制理论与深度学习结合的潜力，为语言模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling tasks have been driven by
architectures such as Transformers and, more recently, by Selective State Space
Models (SSMs). In this paper, we introduce an alternative selection mechanism
inspired by control theory methodologies. Specifically, we propose a novel
residual generator for selection, drawing an analogy to fault detection
strategies in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike Mamba, which utilizes
Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems, our approach combines multiple LTI systems,
preserving their beneficial properties during training while achieving
comparable selectivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
architecture, we test its performance on synthetic tasks. While these tasks are
not inherently critical, they serve as benchmarks to test the selectivity
properties of different cores architecture. This work highlights the potential
of integrating theoretical insights with experimental advancements, offering a
complementary perspective to deep learning innovations at the intersection of
control theory and machine learning.

improve performance, we design a novel layer-wise masking strategy applied to
each Mamba layer, allowing selective attention to relevant code features at
different depths. Additionally, we introduce a progressive layer-wise loss,
supervising the network at intermediate stages and promoting robust feature
extraction throughout the decoding process. Comprehensive experiments across a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习ANC算法性能优异，但缺乏理论极限评估其改进。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过信息论和支持性限制，推导出ANC性能的统一下限，量化信息处理能力和物理约束的影响。

Result: 实验验证了该下限的紧密度，并在不同混响条件下展示了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文的理论下限为ANC算法的性能评估提供了严格标准，并揭示了其改进的潜在极限。

Abstract: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms aim to suppress unwanted acoustic
disturbances by generating anti-noise signals that destructively interfere with
the original noise in real time. Although recent deep learning-based ANC
algorithms have set new performance benchmarks, there remains a shortage of
theoretical limits to rigorously assess their improvements. To address this, we
derive a unified lower bound on cancellation performance composed of two
components. The first component is information-theoretic: it links residual
error power to the fraction of disturbance entropy captured by the anti-noise
signal, thereby quantifying limits imposed by information-processing capacity.
The second component is support-based: it measures the irreducible error
arising in frequency bands that the cancellation path cannot address,
reflecting fundamental physical constraints. By taking the maximum of these two
terms, our bound establishes a theoretical ceiling on the Normalized Mean
Squared Error (NMSE) attainable by any ANC algorithm. We validate its tightness
empirically on the NOISEX dataset under varying reverberation times,
demonstrating robustness across diverse acoustic conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂约束路由问题的挑战，提供高质量的可行解。

Method: 提出LazyMask解码方法，结合回溯机制和细化强度嵌入，减少采样成本。

Result: 在TSPTW和TSPDL上实现了最先进的可行率和解质量。

Conclusion: LMask在理论和实验上均表现出色，优于现有神经方法。

Abstract: Routing problems are canonical combinatorial optimization tasks with
wide-ranging applications in logistics, transportation, and supply chain
management. However, solving these problems becomes significantly more
challenging when complex constraints are involved. In this paper, we propose
LMask, a novel learning framework that utilizes dynamic masking to generate
high-quality feasible solutions for constrained routing problems. LMask
introduces the LazyMask decoding method, which lazily refines feasibility masks
with the backtracking mechanism. In addition, it employs the refinement
intensity embedding to encode the search trace into the model, mitigating
representation ambiguities induced by backtracking. To further reduce sampling
cost, LMask sets a backtracking budget during decoding, while constraint
violations are penalized in the loss function during training to counteract
infeasibility caused by this budget. We provide theoretical guarantees for the
validity and probabilistic optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments on
the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and TSP with draft
limits (TSPDL) demonstrate that LMask achieves state-of-the-art feasibility
rates and solution quality, outperforming existing neural methods.

Motivation: 现有SGD分析通常依赖于难以验证的梯度方差假设，本文旨在提供无需此类假设的理论保证。

Method: 利用简单的Lyapunov能量单调性，推导新的理论界限，并通过性能估计问题验证其紧致性。

Result: 理论界限优于现有最优结果，且适用于更大的步长范围。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在理论和实证上均表现出色，为SGD分析提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: The analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often relies on making some
assumption on the variance of the stochastic gradients, which is usually not
satisfied or difficult to verify in practice. This paper contributes to a
recent line of works which attempt to provide guarantees without making any
variance assumption, leveraging only the (strong) convexity and smoothness of
the loss functions. In this context, we prove new theoretical bounds derived
from the monotonicity of a simple Lyapunov energy, improving the current
state-of-the-art and extending their validity to larger step-sizes. Our
theoretical analysis is backed by a Performance Estimation Problem analysis,
which allows us to claim that, empirically, the bias term in our bounds is
tight within our framework.

Motivation: 传统DeepONet在MPC中需要多次评估以生成多步预测，效率较低，因此提出MS-DeepONet以一次性完成多步预测。

Method: 设计了MS-DeepONet架构，结合分支网络和主干网络，实现多步输入序列到多步输出的直接映射，并开发了自动化超参数选择策略。

Result: MS-DeepONet在多个非线性系统（如van der Pol振荡器、四水箱过程和不稳定倒立摆系统）中表现优于标准DeepONet。

Conclusion: MS-DeepONet是一种高效且通用的多步预测架构，适用于MPC任务，并在实际系统中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the design of model predictive control (MPC)
algorithms based on deep operator neural networks (DeepONets). These neural
networks are capable of accurately approximating real and complex valued
solutions of continuous time nonlinear systems without relying on recurrent
architectures. The DeepONet architecture is made up of two feedforward neural
networks: the branch network, which encodes the input function space, and the
trunk network, which represents dependencies on temporal variables or initial
conditions. Utilizing the original DeepONet architecture as a predictor within
MPC for Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) systems requires multiple branch
networks, to generate multi output predictions, one for each input. Moreover,
to predict multiple time steps into the future, the network has to be evaluated
multiple times. Motivated by this, we introduce a multi step DeepONet
(MS-DeepONet) architecture that computes in one shot multi step predictions of
system outputs from multi step input sequences, which is better suited for MPC.
We prove that the MS DeepONet is a universal approximator in terms of multi
step sequence prediction. Additionally, we develop automated hyper parameter
selection strategies and implement MPC frameworks using both the standard
DeepONet and the proposed MS DeepONet architectures in PyTorch. The
implementation is publicly available on GitHub. Simulation results demonstrate
that MS-DeepONet consistently outperforms the standard DeepONet in learning and
predictive control tasks across several nonlinear benchmark systems: the van
der Pol oscillator, the quadruple tank process, and a cart pendulum unstable
system, where it successfully learns and executes multiple swing up and
stabilization policies.

*Rui Wang,Qianguo Sun,Tianrong Chen,Zhiyun Zeng,Junlong Wu,Jiaxing Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出DistilCodec和UniTTS，通过将多码本音频编解码器蒸馏为单码本编解码器，并整合多模态任务，解决了LLM-based TTS中语义与声学信息不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多码本音频编解码器（如RVQ和GVQ）在LLM-based TTS中语义与声学信息无法完全对齐，导致LLM对音频信息的访问受限。

Method: 提出DistilCodec（将多码本蒸馏为单码本）和UniTTS（整合音频模态自回归、文本模态自回归和跨模态自回归任务）。

Result: DistilCodec实现近100%的码本利用率，UniTTS支持交错的文本和语音提示，同时保留LLM的文本能力。

Conclusion: DistilCodec和UniTTS有效解决了信息不对齐问题，扩展了数据多样性，提升了LLM-based TTS的性能。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-codebook neutral audio codecs such as Residual Vector
Quantization (RVQ) and Group Vector Quantization (GVQ) has significantly
advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. These
codecs are crucial in separating semantic and acoustic information while
efficiently harnessing semantic priors. However, since semantic and acoustic
information cannot be fully aligned, a significant drawback of these methods
when applied to LLM-based TTS is that large language models may have limited
access to comprehensive audio information. To address this limitation, we
propose DistilCodec and UniTTS, which collectively offer the following
advantages: 1) This method can distill a multi-codebook audio codec into a
single-codebook audio codec with 32,768 codes while achieving a near 100\%
utilization. 2) As DistilCodec does not employ a semantic alignment scheme, a
large amount of high-quality unlabeled audio (such as audiobooks with sound
effects, songs, etc.) can be incorporated during training, further expanding
data diversity and broadening its applicability. 3) Leveraging the
comprehensive audio information modeling of DistilCodec, we integrated three
key tasks into UniTTS's pre-training framework: audio modality autoregression,
text modality autoregression, and speech-text cross-modal autoregression. This
allows UniTTS to accept interleaved text and speech/audio prompts while
substantially preserving LLM's text capabilities. 4) UniTTS employs a
three-stage training process: Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and
Alignment. Source code and model checkpoints are publicly available at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CosyVoice 3是CosyVoice 2的改进版，专注于零样本多语言语音合成，提升了内容一致性、说话人相似性和韵律自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CosyVoice 2在语言覆盖、领域多样性、数据量、文本格式和后训练技术上的局限性。

Method: 1) 新型语音标记器；2) 可微分奖励模型；3) 数据量扩展；4) 模型规模扩大。

Result: 在多语言基准测试中表现更优，支持9种语言和18种中文方言。

Conclusion: CosyVoice 3显著推动了语音合成的进步，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In our prior works, we introduced a scalable streaming speech synthesis
model, CosyVoice 2, which integrates a large language model (LLM) and a
chunk-aware flow matching (FM) model, and achieves low-latency bi-streaming
speech synthesis and human-parity quality. Despite these advancements,
CosyVoice 2 exhibits limitations in language coverage, domain diversity, data
volume, text formats, and post-training techniques. In this paper, we present
CosyVoice 3, an improved model designed for zero-shot multilingual speech
synthesis in the wild, surpassing its predecessor in content consistency,
speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. Key features of CosyVoice 3
include: 1) A novel speech tokenizer to improve prosody naturalness, developed
via supervised multi-task training, including automatic speech recognition,
speech emotion recognition, language identification, audio event detection, and
speaker analysis. 2) A new differentiable reward model for post-training
applicable not only to CosyVoice 3 but also to other LLM-based speech synthesis
models. 3) Dataset Size Scaling: Training data is expanded from ten thousand
hours to one million hours, encompassing 9 languages and 18 Chinese dialects
across various domains and text formats. 4) Model Size Scaling: Model
parameters are increased from 0.5 billion to 1.5 billion, resulting in enhanced
performance on our multilingual benchmark due to the larger model capacity.
These advancements contribute significantly to the progress of speech synthesis
in the wild. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at

*Natsuo Yamashita,Masaaki Yamamoto,Hiroaki Kokubo,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语音信息的生成式纠错方法，针对罕见词和过校正问题，显著降低了错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的生成式纠错方法因忽视语音信息和罕见词训练数据不足，导致过校正和罕见词纠错效果差。

Method: 通过生成合成数据增强罕见词训练，并整合ASR的N-best假设和语音上下文以减少过校正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在英语和日语数据集中显著提升了罕见词纠错效果，同时降低了WER和CER。

Conclusion: 结合语音信息和罕见词训练的GER方法有效解决了现有问题，提升了ASR性能。

Abstract: Generative error correction (GER) with large language models (LLMs) has
emerged as an effective post-processing approach to improve automatic speech
recognition (ASR) performance. However, it often struggles with rare or
domain-specific words due to limited training data. Furthermore, existing
LLM-based GER approaches primarily rely on textual information, neglecting
phonetic cues, which leads to over-correction. To address these issues, we
propose a novel LLM-based GER approach that targets rare words and incorporates
phonetic information. First, we generate synthetic data to contain rare words
for fine-tuning the GER model. Second, we integrate ASR's N-best hypotheses
along with phonetic context to mitigate over-correction. Experimental results
show that our method not only improves the correction of rare words but also
reduces the WER and CER across both English and Japanese datasets.

*Anna Spagnolli,Cecilia Tolomini,Elisa Beretta,Claudio Sarra*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究测试了欧盟AI法规中医疗AI使用说明书（IFU）的透明度和相关性是否满足用户需求，调查显示不同利益相关者对透明需求优先级不同，且IFU结构存在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟AI法规要求医疗AI的IFU必须透明且相关，但现有IFU是否满足这一要求尚不明确。

Method: 通过Qualtrics平台对四类直接利益相关者（管理者、医疗专业人员、患者和IT专家）进行在线调查，评估透明需求的相关性及IFU结构的匹配度。

Result: 结果显示不同利益相关者对透明需求的优先级不同，且IFU结构未能有效映射这些需求。

Conclusion: 研究提出了构建更具本地意义的IFU的建议。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in healthcare and is
pervasively incorporated into medical software and equipment. In the European
Union, healthcare is a high-risk application domain for AI, and providers must
prepare Instructions for Use (IFU) according to the European regulation
2024/1689 (AI Act). To this regulation, the principle of transparency is
cardinal and requires the IFU to be clear and relevant to the users. This study
tests whether these latter requirements are satisfied by the IFU structure. A
survey was administered online via the Qualtrics platform to four types of
direct stakeholders, i.e., managers (N = 238), healthcare professionals (N =
115), patients (N = 229), and Information Technology experts (N = 230). The
participants rated the relevance of a set of transparency needs and indicated
the IFU section addressing them. The results reveal differentiated priorities
across stakeholders and a troubled mapping of transparency needs onto the IFU
structure. Recommendations to build a locally meaningful IFU are derived.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升教学质量、改善学生学习成果和增强机构声誉需要全面且客观的讲师绩效评估系统。

Method: 采用多层感知机（MLP）算法处理复杂数据模式，结合学生评分、研究成果、经验和管理职责等多维度指标，使用面向对象分析与设计（OOAD）方法开发系统。

Result: 模型评估准确率为91%，测试损失（MSE）为256.99，平均绝对误差（MAE）为13.76，预测准确率约96%。

Conclusion: MLP模型通过提供准确预测、减少偏见和支持数据驱动决策，显著提高了讲师绩效评估的公平性和效率。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of a lecturer has been essential for enhancing
teaching quality, improving student learning outcomes, and strengthening the
institution's reputation. The absence of such a system brings about lecturer
performance evaluation which was neither comprehensive nor holistic. This
system was designed using a web-based platform, created a secure database, and
by using a custom dataset, captured some performance metrics which included
student evaluation scores, Research Publications, Years of Experience, and
Administrative Duties. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm was utilized due
to its ability to process complex data patterns and generates accurate
predictions in a lecturer's performance based on historical data. This research
focused on designing multiple performance metrics beyond the standard ones,
incorporating student participation, and integrating analytical tools to
deliver a comprehensive and holistic evaluation of lecturers' performance and
was developed using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) methodology.
Lecturers' performance is evaluated by the model, and the evaluation accuracy
is about 91% compared with actual performance. Finally, by evaluating the
performance of the MLP model, it is concluded that MLP enhanced lecturer
performance evaluation by providing accurate predictions, reducing bias, and
supporting data-driven decisions, ultimately improving the fairness and
efficiency of the evaluation process. The MLP model's performance was evaluated
using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), achieved a test
loss (MSE) of 256.99 and a MAE of 13.76, and reflected a high level of
prediction accuracy. The model also demonstrated an estimated accuracy rate of
approximately 96%, validated its effectiveness in predicting lecturer
performance.

Result: 论文详细描述了工具包的开发过程及合作谈判，旨在为其他团队提供合作蓝图。

Conclusion: 该工具包不仅满足合规需求，还推动了AI开发中的社会伦理考量，为学术界与行业合作提供了范例。

Abstract: The introduction of the AI Act in the European Union presents the AI research
and practice community with a set of new challenges related to compliance.
While it is certain that AI practitioners will require additional guidance and
tools to meet these requirements, previous research on toolkits that aim to
translate the theory of AI ethics into development and deployment practice
suggests that such resources suffer from multiple limitations. These
limitations stem, in part, from the fact that the toolkits are either produced
by industry-based teams or by academics whose work tends to be abstract and
divorced from the realities of industry. In this paper, we discuss the
challenge of developing an AI ethics toolkit for practitioners that helps them
comply with new AI-focused regulation, but that also moves beyond mere
compliance to consider broader socio-ethical questions throughout development
and deployment. The toolkit was created through a cross-sectoral collaboration
between an academic team based in the UK and an industry team in Italy. We
outline the background and rationale for creating a pro-justice AI Act
compliance toolkit, detail the process undertaken to develop it, and describe
the collaboration and negotiation efforts that shaped its creation. We aim for
the described process to serve as a blueprint for other teams navigating the
challenges of academia-industry partnerships and aspiring to produce usable and
meaningful AI ethics resources.

Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模、公开的个体行为数据集，限制了数字孪生方法的发展和验证。

Method: 通过四波调查收集了2,058名美国参与者的数据，涵盖人口统计、心理、经济等多维度信息，并重复部分任务以验证测试-重测准确性。

Result: 初步分析表明数据质量高，可用于构建预测个体和群体行为的数字孪生模型。

Conclusion: 公开数据集为LLM数字孪生模拟提供了测试基准，同时也支持广泛的社会科学研究。

Abstract: LLM-based digital twin simulation, where large language models are used to
emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in AI,
social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has
been hindered by the scarcity of real, individual-level datasets that are both
large and publicly available. This lack of high-quality ground truth limits
both the development and validation of digital twin methodologies. To address
this gap, we introduce a large-scale, public dataset designed to capture a rich
and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative
sample of $N = 2,058$ participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the US
across four waves with 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery
of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures,
as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing
survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a
test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high
quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human
behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. By making the full
dataset publicly available, we aim to establish a valuable testbed for the
development and benchmarking of LLM-based persona simulations. Beyond LLM
applications, due to its unique breadth and scale the dataset also enables
broad social science research, including studies of cross-construct
correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.

Result: 识别出15种编辑行为，发现学生编辑行为分为四种模式，挑战了学生对AI工具被动使用的假设。

Conclusion: 研究结果对EFL写作教学中AI生成文本的编辑策略有重要启示。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is transforming how English as a foreign
language students write. Still, little is known about how students manipulate
text generated by generative AI during the writing process. This study
investigates how EFL secondary school students integrate and modify
AI-generated text when completing an expository writing task. The study
employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. Screen recordings were collected
from 29 Hong Kong secondary school students who attended an AI-assisted writing
workshop and recorded their screens while using generative AI to write an
article. Content analysis with hierarchical coding and thematic analysis with a
multiple case study approach were adopted to analyze the recordings. 15 types
of AI-generated text edits across seven categories were identified from the
recordings. Notably, AI-initiated edits from iOS and Google Docs emerged as
unanticipated sources of AI-generated text. A thematic analysis revealed four
patterns of students' editing behaviors based on planning and drafting
direction: planning with top-down drafting and revising; top-down drafting and
revising without planning; planning with bottom-up drafting and revising; and
bottom-up drafting and revising without planning. Network graphs illustrate
cases of each pattern, demonstrating that students' interactions with
AI-generated text involve more complex cognitive processes than simple text
insertion. The findings challenge assumptions about students' passive,
simplistic use of generative AI tools and have implications for developing
explicit instructional approaches to teaching AI-generated text editing
strategies in the AFL writing pedagogy.

Motivation: 多模态数据集的透明度和伦理属性对负责任AI至关重要，但目前相关研究稀缺且难以比较。

Method: 引入TEDI框架，包含143个指标，手动标注和分析100多个多模态数据集，重点关注数据来源、规模和模态。

Result: 研究发现，仅有少数数据集记录了伦理相关属性（如同意、隐私和有害内容），且伦理指标的关注度因数据收集方法而异。

Conclusion: TEDI框架提升了数据集的透明度和伦理分析，为未来自动化信息提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dataset transparency is a key enabler of responsible AI, but insights into
multimodal dataset attributes that impact trustworthy and ethical aspects of AI
applications remain scarce and are difficult to compare across datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators
(TEDI) that facilitate the systematic, empirical analysis of dataset
documentation. TEDI encompasses 143 fine-grained indicators that characterize
trustworthy and ethical attributes of multimodal datasets and their collection
processes. The indicators are framed to extract verifiable information from
dataset documentation. Using TEDI, we manually annotated and analyzed over 100
multimodal datasets that include human voices. We further annotated data
sourcing, size, and modality details to gain insights into the factors that
shape trustworthy and ethical dimensions across datasets. We find that only a
select few datasets have documented attributes and practices pertaining to
consent, privacy, and harmful content indicators. The extent to which these and
other ethical indicators are addressed varies based on the data collection
method, with documentation of datasets collected via crowdsourced and direct
collection approaches being more likely to mention them. Scraping dominates
scale at the cost of ethical indicators, but is not the only viable collection
method. Our approach and empirical insights contribute to increasing dataset
transparency along trustworthy and ethical dimensions and pave the way for
automating the tedious task of extracting information from dataset
documentation in future.

Abstract: Legal AI systems are increasingly being adopted by judicial and legal system
deployers and providers worldwide to support a range of applications. While
they offer potential benefits such as reducing bias, increasing efficiency, and
improving accountability, they also pose significant risks, requiring a careful
balance between opportunities, and legal and ethical development and
deployment. AI literacy, as a legal requirement under the EU AI Act and a
critical enabler of ethical AI for deployers and providers, could be a tool to
achieve this. The article introduces the term "legal AI systems" and then
analyzes the concept of AI literacy and the benefits and risks associated with
these systems. This analysis is linked to a broader AI-L concept for
organizations that deal with legal AI systems. The outcome of the article, a
roadmap questionnaire as a practical tool for developers and providers to
assess risks, benefits, and stakeholder concerns, could be useful in meeting
societal and regulatory expectations for legal AI.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于GPS辅助的深度学习模型，用于预测无人机毫米波通信中的当前和未来最优波束，显著降低了开销并保持了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信在无人机通信中面临路径损耗大和动态移动性导致链路不稳定的挑战，需要一种高效的波束管理方法。

Method: 采用GPS预处理技术提取关键位置特征，结合深度学习架构将序列位置数据映射到波束索引预测，并通过数据集分割方法确保标签分布平衡。

Result: 模型在Top-1预测准确率超过70%，平均功率损耗低于0.6 dB，开销减少约93%，波束预测准确率达95%。

Conclusion: 该模型通过高效的数据处理和深度学习架构，显著提升了无人机毫米波通信的波束管理性能。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables high data rates for
cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, a robust beam
management remains challenging due to significant path loss and the dynamic
mobility of UAVs, which can destabilize the UAV-base station (BS) link. This
research presents a GPS-aided deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously
predicts current and future optimal beams for UAV mmWave communications,
maintaining a Top-1 prediction accuracy exceeding 70% and an average power loss
below 0.6 dB across all prediction steps. These outcomes stem from a proposed
data set splitting method ensuring balanced label distribution, paired with a
GPS preprocessing technique that extracts key positional features, and a DL
architecture that maps sequential position data to beam index predictions. The
model reduces overhead by approximately 93% (requiring the training of 2 ~ 3
beams instead of 32 beams) with 95% beam prediction accuracy guarantees, and
ensures 94% to 96% of predictions exhibit mean power loss not exceeding 1 dB.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统且可重复的方法，评估文本到图像（TTI）扩散模型在描绘不同历史时期时的表现，揭示了其在历史准确性上的系统性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TTI扩散模型在内容创作中的影响力增加，研究其对社会和文化的影响变得重要。然而，现有研究多关注人口和文化偏见，而模型对历史背景的准确描绘尚未充分探索。

Method: 作者引入HistVis数据集，包含30,000张由三种先进扩散模型生成的合成图像，通过精心设计的提示词描绘不同历史时期的普遍人类活动。评估聚焦于三个方面：隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 研究发现，TTI模型在历史主题图像中存在系统性不准确，包括对历史时期的刻板印象、时代错误以及未能反映合理的人口分布。

Conclusion: 本文提供了评估生成图像中历史表现的可扩展方法和基准，为构建更准确和文化对齐的TTI模型迈出了第一步。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Abstract: Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision
encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder
and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the
projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence
the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In
this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision
embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector
significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while
preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual
content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each
vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a
*multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the
projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a
limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue,
we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level
alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves
stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling
the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's
performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on
question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks
when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method
can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: Volumetric rendering of Computed Tomography (CT) scans is crucial for
visualizing complex 3D anatomical structures in medical imaging. Current
high-fidelity approaches, especially neural rendering techniques, require
time-consuming per-scene optimization, limiting clinical applicability due to
computational demands and poor generalizability. We propose Render-FM, a novel
foundation model for direct, real-time volumetric rendering of CT scans.
Render-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D
Gaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan
optimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By
integrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our
approach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D
visualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that
Render-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized
per-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an
hour to seconds for a single inference step. This advancement enables seamless
integration into real-time surgical planning and diagnostic workflows. The

Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from
astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful

priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves
better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration
problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster,
and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国尤其是加州野火频发，造成严重损失，亟需高效的检测技术以减少灾害。

Method: 使用10.74 GB高分辨率图像数据集，分类为'fire'和'nofire'，通过ViT模型进行训练，数据预处理包括调整大小、转换为张量和归一化。

Result: ViT模型能够处理复杂图像数据，但实时数据获取、计算成本和检测准确性仍是问题。

Conclusion: 尽管ViT在野火检测中具有潜力，仍需解决数据、计算和实时集成等挑战以实现实际应用。

Abstract: The critical need for sophisticated detection techniques has been highlighted
by the rising frequency and intensity of wildfires in the US, especially in
California. In 2023, wildfires caused 130 deaths nationwide, the highest since
1990. In January 2025, Los Angeles wildfires which included the Palisades and
Eaton fires burnt approximately 40,000 acres and 12,000 buildings, and caused
loss of human lives. The devastation underscores the urgent need for effective
detection and prevention strategies. Deep learning models, such as Vision
Transformers (ViTs), can enhance early detection by processing complex image
data with high accuracy. However, wildfire detection faces challenges,
including the availability of high-quality, real-time data. Wildfires often
occur in remote areas with limited sensor coverage, and environmental factors
like smoke and cloud cover can hinder detection. Additionally, training deep
learning models is computationally expensive, and issues like false
positives/negatives and scaling remain concerns. Integrating detection systems
with real-time alert mechanisms also poses difficulties. In this work, we used
the wildfire dataset consisting of 10.74 GB high-resolution images categorized
into 'fire' and 'nofire' classes is used for training the ViT model. To prepare
the data, images are resized to 224 x 224 pixels, converted into tensor format,
and normalized using ImageNet statistics.

Motivation: 移动设备和数据收集技术的普及导致轨迹数据激增，传统轨迹检索方法在大规模数据处理、条件查询支持和多模态灵活性方面存在不足。

Method: OmniTraj通过设计四种模态（原始轨迹、拓扑、路段和区域）的专用编码器，并将其嵌入共享表示空间，实现多模态融合和灵活查询。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，OmniTraj能高效处理大规模数据，支持多模态查询，并适用于下游任务。

Conclusion: OmniTraj通过多模态融合和灵活查询设计，显著提升了轨迹检索的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies
has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant
challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and
accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory
retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale
data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory
similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a
generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that
integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories,
topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike
traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing
trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each
modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This
design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any
individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of
traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale
data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream
tasks and applications.

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology present a significant challenge
for large-scale medical image analysis due to their high resolution, large
size, and complex tile relationships. Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication
contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing
VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements,
including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and
images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant
elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce
OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object
detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real
and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box
annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop
and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through
three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the
chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection
models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI
element detection.

Conclusion: RoHyDR通过混合扩散和对抗学习机制，有效解决了IMER问题，为多模态情感识别提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from
multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause
missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion
Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion
Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at
unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation
recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to
generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from
Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal
fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused
multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further
propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability
and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and
adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of
missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at
both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance
degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods,
achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但仍存在物体幻觉问题，即模型生成不准确的描述。现有方法在可扩展性和依赖外部模块方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出Ensemble Decoding (ED)，将输入图像分割为子图像，通过注意力图权重分配结合logit分布，并引入ED自适应合理性约束和FastED变体。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ED方法有效解决了物体幻觉问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly expanded their utility in tasks like image captioning and visual
question answering. However, they still struggle with object hallucination,
where models generate descriptions that inaccurately reflect the visual content
by including nonexistent objects or misrepresenting existing ones. While
previous methods, such as data augmentation and training-free approaches,
strive to tackle this issue, they still encounter scalability challenges and
often depend on additional external modules. In this work, we propose Ensemble
Decoding (ED), a novel strategy that splits the input image into sub-images and
combines logit distributions by assigning weights through the attention map.
Furthermore, we introduce ED adaptive plausibility constraint to calibrate
logit distribution and FastED, a variant designed for speed-critical
applications. Extensive experiments across hallucination benchmarks demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型难以从简短且不明确的提示中准确捕捉用户意图，且现有基于大语言模型的提示增强方法常因缺乏视觉语义和现实组合的支撑而生成不切实际的内容。

Method: 提出RePrompt框架，通过强化学习训练语言模型生成结构化、自反思的提示，优化图像级结果。奖励模型评估生成图像的人类偏好、语义对齐和视觉组合，间接监督提示生成。

Result: 在GenEval和T2I-Compbench上的实验表明，RePrompt显著提升了空间布局保真度和组合泛化能力，取得了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: RePrompt通过引入显式推理和强化学习，为文本到图像生成提供了一种无需人工标注数据的端到端训练方法，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, existing models
often struggle to faithfully capture user intentions from short and
under-specified prompts. While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts
using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic
or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and
real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language
model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces
explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement
learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our
method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts
by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the
generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual
composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our
approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments
on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial
layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones,
establishing new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: ANSE（主动噪声选择生成）是一种模型感知框架，通过基于注意力的不确定性量化选择高质量噪声种子，提升视频扩散模型的质量和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 初始噪声的选择对视频扩散模型的质量和提示对齐有显著影响，但现有方法常忽略模型内部信号。

Method: 提出BANSA（贝叶斯主动噪声选择通过注意力），通过多随机注意力样本的熵分歧估计模型置信度和一致性，并引入伯努利掩码近似实现高效推断。

Result: 在CogVideoX-2B和5B上实验表明，ANSE仅增加8%和13%的推断时间，显著提升视频质量和时间一致性。

Conclusion: ANSE为视频扩散中的噪声选择提供了原则性和可推广的方法。

Abstract: The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt
alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same
prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely
on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame
smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise
seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise
Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality
noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA
(Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that
measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to
estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time
deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables
score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention
layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video
quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference
time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise
selection in video diffusion. See our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型预训练的计算成本不断增加，测试时扩展（TTS）成为提升生成模型性能的有前景方向。然而，现有方法在视觉任务中存在局限性，如领域受限、扩展性差或牺牲样本多样性。

Method: EvoSearch将测试时扩展问题转化为进化搜索问题，利用生物进化原理优化去噪轨迹，通过选择和突变机制迭代生成高质量样本并保持多样性。

Conclusion: EvoSearch是一种通用且高效的测试时扩展方法，显著提升了图像和视频生成模型的性能。

Abstract: As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during
model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS)
has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance
by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has
demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains
a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and
video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent
works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision
tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to
task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward
over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and
efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image
and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring
additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time
scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem,
leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and
refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection
and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation
denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring
while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both
diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches,
achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen
evaluation metrics. Our project is available at the website

Conclusion: HoloLLM为语言基础的多模态感知智能提供了新基础。

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior
through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded
perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world
scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this
paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that
integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared,
mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning
across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the
scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the
heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we
design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances
pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from
tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing
significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative
data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing
datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that
HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded
human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for
real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAMA的方法，用于改进多模态上下文学习（ICL）中的注意力机制，提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态ICL存在不稳定性，研究主要关注序列配置优化，而忽略了LVLM内部机制。论文旨在解决标准注意力的三个核心限制。

Method: 提出Context-Aware Modulated Attention（CAMA），一种无需训练、即插即用的方法，直接校准LVLM的注意力对数。

Result: 在四种LVLM和六个基准测试中验证了CAMA的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CAMA为深入探索和针对性利用LVLM注意力动态提供了新机会，推动了多模态推理的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) enables large vision-language models
(LVLMs) to efficiently adapt to novel tasks, supporting a wide array of
real-world applications. However, multimodal ICL remains unstable, and current
research largely focuses on optimizing sequence configuration while overlooking
the internal mechanisms of LVLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical
analysis of attentional dynamics in multimodal ICL and identify three core
limitations of standard attention that ICL impair performance. To address these
challenges, we propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a simple yet
effective plug-and-play method for directly calibrating LVLM attention logits.
CAMA is training-free and can be seamlessly applied to various open-source
LVLMs. We evaluate CAMA on four LVLMs across six benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness and generality. CAMA opens new opportunities for deeper
exploration and targeted utilization of LVLM attention dynamics to advance
multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）容易受到利用视觉-文本交互的越狱攻击，现有防御方法效果有限。

Method: 引入一种新的安全相关分布偏移形式化方法，动态调整视觉令牌权重，减少对抗性视觉输入的影响。

Result: DTR在多种VLMs和攻击基准测试中表现优于现有防御方法，同时保持模型的一般能力和推理效率。

Conclusion: DTR首次成功将KV缓存优化应用于多模态基础模型的安全增强，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails.
In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates
multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV)
caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly
image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant
distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables
DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of
adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and
inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack
benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack
robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful
application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal
foundation models. The code for replicating DTR is available:

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种结合Transformer和CNN的区域感知代理网络，通过区域级上下文依赖和全局类别细化，实现了高分辨率遥感图像的高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像分割因复杂的空间布局和多样化的物体外观而具有挑战性，现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）各有局限性。

Method: RAPNet由两部分组成：上下文区域注意力（CRA）模块通过Transformer捕获区域级依赖关系，生成语义区域掩码（SRM）；全局类别细化（GCR）模块学习全局类别注意力图，结合SRM实现精确分割。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，RAPNet优于现有方法，实现了更高的多类分割精度。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过区域级操作和全局上下文建模，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image segmentation is challenging due
to complex spatial layouts and diverse object appearances. While CNNs excel at
capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas
Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are
computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy
Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention
(CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely
on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible
segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level
contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR
module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information,
combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on
three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的图表常带有噪声或挑战性特征，而现有MLLMs在处理这些‘异常图表’时表现不佳，因此需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: CHAOS包含5种文本和10种视觉扰动，分为三个难度级别，测试了13种MLLMs在ChartQA和Chart-to-Text任务上的表现。

Result: 实验和案例分析揭示了模型在不同图表扰动下的鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了指导。

Conclusion: CHAOS为图表理解领域的研究提供了基准，并公开了数据和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Charts play a critical role in data analysis and visualization, yet
real-world applications often present charts with challenging or noisy
features. However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret
perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier
Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart
perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual
perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard)
inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-,
and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data.
Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and
Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical
insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide
future research in chart understanding domain. Data and code are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的零样本异常检测方法依赖手工或静态可学习提示，存在语义覆盖有限和适应性差的问题，且对类别标签的表述敏感。

Method: 提出ViP-Prompt机制，结合全局和多尺度局部视觉上下文生成自适应文本提示，避免依赖类别标签和手动模板。

Result: 在15个工业和医学基准测试中，ViP$^{2}$-CLIP实现了最先进的性能和强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViP$^{2}$-CLIP通过自适应提示机制显著提升了零样本异常检测的效果，适用于类别标签模糊或隐私受限的场景。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to detect anomalies without any
target domain training samples, relying solely on external auxiliary data.
Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via
handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering
costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical
descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex
variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale
classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to
the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies
that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce
ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception
Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local
visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating
manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus
on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category
labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15
industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.

Result: 实验验证了Seek-CAD在多种指标下的有效性。

Conclusion: Seek-CAD为CAD生成提供了一种高效、灵活且成本可控的新方法。

Abstract: The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling will
significantly transform the design of industrial products. The recent research
endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In
contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the
advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and
efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric
models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of
the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The
Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference
LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free
methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual
and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for
generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model
is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are
subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the
corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation.
Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated
model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D
CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and
Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of
CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application
requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.

Motivation: 现有图像分词方法仅能捕捉全局抽象概念或均匀分割的图像块，限制了MLLMs在对象级别理解和生成详细视觉内容的能力。

Method: 基于Q-Former编码器、扩散解码器和残差向量量化，提出了一种离散化的Slot分词器，既能编码局部视觉细节，又能保持高级语义，并与文本数据对齐。

Result: Slot-MLLM在需要局部细节理解和生成的视觉语言任务中表现显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 首次证明了基于MLLMs和自然图像的以对象为中心的Slot Attention的可行性。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key
approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular,
vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also
visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient
image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output.
However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only
global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting
MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual
content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we
propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically
for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and
residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode
local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align
with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token
prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant
performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across
various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and
generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of
object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural
images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV-based 3D物体检测方法在角度表示上存在损失函数不连续的问题，影响性能。论文受航空定向物体检测启发，提出RQR3D来解决这一问题。

Method: RQR3D将定向物体检测问题转化为关键点回归任务，回归最小的水平边界框及其偏移量。同时结合无锚单阶段检测方法和雷达融合主干网络。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，RQR3D在NDS和mAP上分别提升4%和2.4%，显著减少了平移和方向误差。

Conclusion: RQR3D方法在鲁棒性、精度和实际应用性上表现出色，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的3D感知解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, fast, and reliable 3D perception is essential for autonomous
driving. Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have
emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering
enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing
BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based
representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding
boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial
oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being
affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from
this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D
regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box
encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of
these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem
into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object
detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object
detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance
problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that
eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud
with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive
evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming
the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly
reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe
autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision,
and real-world readiness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答任务中是否更依赖记忆的世界知识或输入图像的视觉信息，通过引入Visual CounterFact数据集和PvP机制，揭示了视觉输入最终会覆盖先验知识的行为，并提供了控制模型输出的工具。

Motivation: 探讨多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中依赖记忆的世界知识还是视觉输入，以理解其推理机制。

Method: 引入Visual CounterFact数据集，设计PvP机制通过激活干预控制模型输出。

Result: 模型预测最初反映记忆先验，但后期转向视觉证据；PvP成功将颜色和尺寸预测从先验转向反事实。

Conclusion: 研究为解释和控制多模态模型的真实性行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual
question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more
on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input
image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of
visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red
strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry).
Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect
memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This
dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input
ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we
propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for
controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through
activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of
color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together,
these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual
behavior in multimodal models.

Result: 在存在背景和性别偏见的基准测试中，LTC比非训练后处理方法提升了50%以上的最差组准确率。

Conclusion: LTC有效识别并纠正了虚假注意力头，同时可视化结果验证了其对比机制的合理性。

Abstract: Multimodal models like CLIP have gained significant attention due to their
remarkable zero-shot performance across various tasks. However, studies have
revealed that CLIP can inadvertently learn spurious associations between target
variables and confounding factors. To address this, we introduce
\textsc{Locate-Then-Correct} (LTC), a contrastive framework that identifies
spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers via mechanistic insights and
mitigates them through targeted ablation. Furthermore, LTC identifies salient,
task-relevant attention heads, enabling the integration of discriminative
features through orthogonal projection to improve classification performance.
We evaluate LTC on benchmarks with inherent background and gender biases,
achieving over a $>50\%$ gain in worst-group accuracy compared to non-training
post-hoc baselines. Additionally, we visualize the representation of selected
heads and find that the presented interpretation corroborates our contrastive
mechanism for identifying both spurious and salient attention heads. Code

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上达到最先进性能，验证了细节增强的有效性和跨领域适应性。

Conclusion: DetailFusion通过全局与细节的协同处理，显著提升了CIR任务的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images from a gallery
based on a reference image and modification text as a combined query. Recent
approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode
the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient
attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle
with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In
this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that
effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities,
thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail
variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a
detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference
Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically
fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each
unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR
and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain
adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly being applied to
a wide range of real-world multimodal applications, involving complex visual
and linguistic reasoning. As these models become more integrated into practical
use, they are expected to handle complex aspects of human interaction. Among
these, color perception is a fundamental yet highly variable aspect of visual
understanding. It differs across individuals due to biological factors such as
Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs), as well as differences in culture and
language. Despite its importance, perceptual diversity has received limited
attention. In our study, we evaluate LVLMs' ability to account for individual
level perceptual variation using the Ishihara Test, a widely used method for
detecting CVDs. Our results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural
language, but they cannot simulate how people with CVDs perceive color in image
based tasks. These findings highlight the need for multimodal systems that can
account for color perceptual diversity and support broader discussions on
perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在物体幻觉（OH）问题上表现不佳，现有方法对视觉决策机制的理解不足。

Result: 实验表明VaLSe能有效减少幻觉输出，并揭示现有OH评估指标的局限性。

Conclusion: VaLSe是一种强大的解释工具，未来需要更细致的OH评估基准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success but
continue to struggle with object hallucination (OH), generating outputs
inconsistent with visual inputs. While previous work has proposed methods to
reduce OH, the visual decision-making mechanisms that lead to hallucinations
remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose VaLSe, a Vision-aware
Latent Steering framework that adopts an interpretation-then-mitigation
strategy to address OH in LVLMs. By tackling dual challenges of modeling
complex vision-language interactions and eliminating spurious activation
artifacts, VaLSe can generate visual contribution maps that trace how specific
visual inputs influence individual output tokens. These maps reveal the model's
vision-aware focus regions, which are then used to perform latent space
steering, realigning internal representations toward semantically relevant
content and reducing hallucinated outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VaLSe is a powerful interpretability tool and an effective method for
enhancing model robustness against OH across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore,
our analysis uncovers limitations in existing OH evaluation metrics,
underscoring the need for more nuanced, interpretable, and visually grounded OH
benchmarks in future work. Code is available at:

Abstract: Dataset pruning -- selecting a small yet informative subset of training data
-- has emerged as a promising strategy for efficient machine learning, offering
significant reductions in computational cost and storage compared to
alternatives like dataset distillation. While pruning methods have shown strong
performance in image classification, their extension to more complex computer
vision tasks, particularly object detection, remains relatively underexplored.
In this paper, we present the first principled extension of classification
pruning techniques to the object detection domain, to the best of our
knowledge. We identify and address three key challenges that hinder this
transition: the Object-Level Attribution Problem, the Scoring Strategy Problem,
and the Image-Level Aggregation Problem. To overcome these, we propose tailored
solutions, including a novel scoring method called Variance-based Prediction
Score (VPS). VPS leverages both Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence
scores to effectively identify informative training samples specific to
detection tasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms prior dataset pruning methods in
terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We also show that annotation count and
class distribution shift can influence detection performance, but selecting
informative examples is a more critical factor than dataset size or balance.
Our work bridges dataset pruning and object detection, paving the way for
dataset pruning in complex vision tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL)
via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language

and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating
cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs.

TL;DR: Diff3M是一种多模态扩散框架，结合胸部X光和电子健康记录（EHR）提升无监督异常检测（UAD）性能，通过图像-EHR交叉注意力模块和静态掩码策略，显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的UAD模型仅依赖图像特征，难以区分正常解剖变异和病理异常，需结合多模态数据提升检测能力。

Method: 提出Diff3M框架，集成胸部X光和结构化EHR，引入图像-EHR交叉注意力模块和静态掩码策略。

Result: 在CheXpert和MIMIC-CXR/IV数据集上表现优异，超越现有UAD方法。

Conclusion: Diff3M通过多模态数据融合显著提升医学影像异常检测性能，为无监督学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for
identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled
data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging
features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical
variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a
multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and
structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection.
Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to
incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process,
improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features.
Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the
reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on
CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging. Our code is

Motivation: 传统基于扩散的方法在盲人脸修复任务中难以生成真实的面部细节且身份一致性较差，因此需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出 DiffusionReward 框架，利用 FRM 提供反馈信号，结合梯度流（包括 FRM、正则化项和结构一致性约束）优化修复网络。FRM 在过程中动态优化以防止奖励破解。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在身份一致性和面部细节方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DiffusionReward 通过 ReFL 框架有效解决了盲人脸修复中的关键问题，为生成高质量人脸图像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) has recently shown great potential in
aligning model outputs with human preferences across various generative tasks.
In this work, we introduce a ReFL framework, named DiffusionReward, to the
Blind Face Restoration task for the first time. DiffusionReward effectively
overcomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to
generate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The
core of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using
carefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role
in steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular,
our ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of
off-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters.
The guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the
FRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a
regularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative
diversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial
fidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the
process. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely
aligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward
hacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity
consistency and facial details. The source codes, data, and models are

Motivation: 传统方法仅支持图像级定位，而许多应用（如搜救、基础设施检查）需要对象级精度。OCGNet旨在解决视角、时间和成像条件变化带来的挑战。

Method: OCGNet结合高斯核传递（GKT）保留位置信息，并嵌入特征编码和匹配模块。还包含位置增强（LE）和多头交叉注意力（MHCA）模块以优化特征。

Result: OCGNet在CVOGL数据集上达到最优性能，并展示少量样本学习能力，适用于多样化应用。

Conclusion: OCGNet通过创新模块和用户交互实现了高效的对象级跨视角地理定位，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image,
captured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced
satellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level
localization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure
inspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables
users to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to
retrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in
viewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges,
especially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite
imagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view
Geo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations
using Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information
throughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder
and feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization.
Additionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a
Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize
object-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when
necessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset,
CVOGL. It also demonstrates few-shot learning capabilities, effectively
generalizing from limited examples, making it suitable for diverse applications

Result: 仅使用25%的训练数据，原型网络性能与传统深度学习模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺情况下仍能有效分类肾结石类型，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Determining the type of kidney stones is crucial for prescribing appropriate
treatments to prevent recurrence. Currently, various approaches exist to
identify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the
reference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in
vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason,
deep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an
automated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless,
a common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This
contribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed
at producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone
types in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This
approach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are
scarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with
a limited training dataset. The results demonstrate that Prototypical Networks,
using up to 25% of the training data, can achieve performance equal to or
better than traditional deep learning models trained with the complete dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep
learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through
annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for
each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation
pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation
foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment
the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to
generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module
that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation
model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and
result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a
set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model
representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization,
guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our
pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot
medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on
seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper
decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs
competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Motivation: 长视频理解因时空复杂性高和长上下文问答困难而具有挑战性，现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理信息密集的长视频时仍有局限。

Method: DVD代理利用多粒度视频数据库的搜索工具，通过LLM的推理能力自主规划、选择工具、制定参数并迭代优化。

Result: 在LVBench等长视频理解基准测试中取得SOTA性能，显著超越先前工作。

Conclusion: DVD代理为长视频理解任务提供了高效解决方案，并通过消融研究和工具分析为未来智能代理的改进提供了见解。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to
extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering
under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long
context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing
information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose
the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over
segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing
a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By
providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our
DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its
current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate
parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light
of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple
long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the
entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly
surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset.
Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided,
yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form
video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

Motivation: 探索强化学习在视觉语言模型中超越推理任务的应用，尤其是在感知密集型任务（如目标检测和定位）中的潜力。

Method: V-Triune包含三个互补组件：样本级数据格式化、验证级奖励计算和源级指标监控，并引入动态IoU奖励。

Conclusion: 统一的强化学习方法对视觉语言模型具有高效性和可扩展性，V-Triune系统和Orsta模型为相关研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond
reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive
tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple
Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual
reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune
comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to
unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver
custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring
(to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel
Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback
for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within
off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone
models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All),
demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception
tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a
diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks
(Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding,
Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains
on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1
across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits
extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the
effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune
system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at

Motivation: LDM-based方法在图像修复中表现优异但推理速度慢，不适用于实时应用，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 利用视觉自回归模型（VAR）进行尺度空间自回归，结合改进的交叉注意力机制和潜在空间细化模块，优化了图像修复任务。

Result: RestoreVAR在生成式图像修复方法中达到最先进性能，同时具备强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RestoreVAR通过VAR模型显著提升了图像修复的效率和性能，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has
significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration
(AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities.
However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their
iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive
applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative
approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in
restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster
inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a
recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for
image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of
state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational
costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose
architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed
cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for
the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also
exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Prompt learning as a parameter-efficient method that has been widely adopted
to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. While hard-prompt
design requires domain expertise and iterative optimization, soft-prompt
methods rely heavily on task-specific hard labels, limiting their
generalization to unseen categories. Recent popular distillation-based prompt
learning methods improve generalization by exploiting larger teacher VLMs and
unsupervised knowledge transfer, yet their repetitive teacher model online
inference sacrifices the inherent training efficiency advantage of prompt
learning. In this paper, we propose {{\large {\textbf{F}}}}aster {{\large
{\textbf{D}}}}istillation-{{\large {\textbf{B}}}}ased {{\large
{\textbf{P}}}}rompt {{\large {\textbf{L}}}}earning (\textbf{FDBPL}), which
addresses these issues by sharing soft supervision contexts across multiple
training stages and implementing accelerated I/O. Furthermore, FDBPL introduces
a region-aware prompt learning paradigm with dual positive-negative prompt
spaces to fully exploit randomly cropped regions that containing multi-level
information. We propose a positive-negative space mutual learning mechanism
based on similarity-difference learning, enabling student CLIP models to
recognize correct semantics while learning to reject weakly related concepts,
thereby improving zero-shot performance. Unlike existing distillation-based
prompt learning methods that sacrifice parameter efficiency for generalization,
FDBPL maintains dual advantages of parameter efficiency and strong downstream
generalization. Comprehensive evaluations across 11 datasets demonstrate
superior performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and
robustness tests, achieving $2.2\times$ faster training speed.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising
applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question
answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic
answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically
meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench,
a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available
MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of
intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting
anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements,
computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench
leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid
reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance,
enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The
benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases,
each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage
evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and
diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with
structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract
knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation. The code is

Conclusion: U2-BENCH为超声影像领域的LVLM研究提供了严格统一的测试平台。

Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare,
yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on
operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language

natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely
unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection,
regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning
15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as
diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation,
and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate
20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and
medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level
classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical
language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to
assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of

Conclusion: HAD-EUNTRFR通过创新的张量分解和正则化策略，显著提升了高光谱异常检测的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral
anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of
remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the
global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in
hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial
domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To
mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named
HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)
factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first
decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then
employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background
component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex
regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to
simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR
factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables
the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and
smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we
design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group
sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex
model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental
results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection
accuracy.

Abstract: Owing to the typical long-tail data distribution issues, simulating
domain-gap-free synthetic data is crucial in robotics, photogrammetry, and
computer vision research. The fundamental challenge pertains to credibly
measuring the difference between real and simulated data. Such a measure is
vital for safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, where
out-of-domain samples may impact a car's perception and cause fatal accidents.
Previous work has commonly focused on simulating data on one scene and
analyzing performance on a different, real-world scene, hampering the disjoint
analysis of domain gap coming from networks' deficiencies, class definitions,
and object representation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
measuring the domain gap between the real world sensor observations and
simulated data representing the same location, enabling comprehensive domain
gap analysis. To measure such a domain gap, we introduce a novel metric
DoGSS-PCL and evaluation assessing the geometric and semantic quality of the
simulated point cloud. Our experiments corroborate that the introduced approach
can be used to measure the domain gap. The tests also reveal that synthetic
semantic point clouds may be used for training deep neural networks,
maintaining the performance at the 50/50 real-to-synthetic ratio. We strongly
believe that this work will facilitate research on credible data simulation and
allow for at-scale deployment in automated driving testing and digital
twinning.

Motivation: 特征工程在广义癫痫检测模型中仍具挑战性，现有模型性能不稳定且难以区分伪影与癫痫数据。

Method: 模型包含卷积、特征提取和预测器三个模块，通过深度和时空卷积提取特征，并引入异常评分后处理技术降低假阳性率。

Result: 在Siena和Juntendo数据集上，F1分数分别从0.177提升至0.336和0.327提升至0.488，精度分别提高15.9%和20.62%。

Conclusion: MR-EEGWaveNet显著优于传统非多分辨率方法，有效解决了癫痫检测中的特征工程问题。

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a
significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance
depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately
distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel
end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which
efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram
(EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across
different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has
three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution
module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution.
The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension
extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted
features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully
connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly
score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce
the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and
analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and
Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the
conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177
to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9%
and 20.62%, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文比较了传统手工方法和可学习特征匹配方法在语义3D建筑相机到模型匹配任务中的表现，发现可学习方法在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习方法在特征匹配中表现出色，但针对语义3D建筑相机到模型匹配任务的全面比较仍缺乏。

Method: 使用标准数据集（HPatches、MegaDepth-1500）和自定义数据集（立面纹理和相机图像），通过PnP算法评估绝对位姿估计的准确性。

Result: 可学习方法在自定义数据集上表现显著优于传统方法，尤其是在零到12个RANSAC内点和零到0.16曲线下面积的情况下。

Conclusion: 该研究将促进基于模型的视觉定位方法的发展。

Abstract: Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and
photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion,
and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature
detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC
outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With
recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and
proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions.
Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical
and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D
building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission
systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching
techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use
standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets
consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and
drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute
pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric
ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate
that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional
approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets
with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We
believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual
localization methods. Link to the code:

Abstract: Reliability and generalization in deep learning are predominantly studied in
the context of image classification. Yet, real-world applications in
safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as
semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of
dedicated model architectures. To facilitate research towards robust model
design in segmentation and detection, our primary objective is to provide
benchmarking tools regarding robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial
manipulations. We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH,
along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and
generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In
particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61
object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under
diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal
systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based
on architecture, backbone, and model capacity. SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH are
open-sourced in our GitHub repository
(https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization)
along with our complete set of total 6139 evaluations. We anticipate the
collected data to foster and encourage future research towards improved model
reliability beyond classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳米材料研究中缺乏高质量标注数据集，阻碍了纳米尺度图像分割模型的开发。

Method: 采用注意力增强的循环一致性生成对抗系统（F-ANcGAN），结合Style U-Net生成器和自注意力U-Net分割网络，并通过数据增强提升多样性。

Result: 在TiO$_2$数据集上，原始FID得分为17.65，经后处理后降至10.39，生成高保真合成数据。

Conclusion: F-ANcGAN为资源有限领域提供了可扩展的高质量数据生成方案，提升了纳米粒子分析的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and
materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is
essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of
high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong
segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we
introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative
adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples
and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from
segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net
segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural
relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the
dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset
generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using
efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity
synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of
downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues
in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited
fields.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于负余弦调度方案的温度调制表示学习方法，用于解决开放集识别（OSR）问题，通过动态调整温度参数优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OSR方法使用恒定的温度参数限制了模型在表示学习中的探索能力，无法兼顾实例级和语义级特征。

Method: 采用负余弦调度方案动态调整温度参数，使模型在训练初期形成粗糙决策边界，逐步平滑优化。

Result: 该方法在多种基线模型和损失函数上验证，显著提升了OSR和闭集性能，尤其在语义偏移基准测试中表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的温度调制方案无需额外计算开销，可灵活集成到现有OSR方法中，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from
novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that
is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a
constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss
function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in
representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In
this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated
representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our
scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of
training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more
neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a
richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods
benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with
mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be
folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed
scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and
contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that
our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in
most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.

Conclusion: QTT方法为高维PDEs的求解提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案，结合了量子启发框架与数据驱动学习的优势。

Abstract: Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical
methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often
struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent
machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short

this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor
trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of
challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate
that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and
computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a
novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework,
combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and
reduced training time.

Method: 提出弱监督预训练（WSP），分两步：先在弱标注数据上进行监督预训练，再用高质量数据微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，WSP在合成和真实弱标注数据上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: WSP是一种适用于低资源ASR场景的有效训练方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech recognition has relied on models trained on vast
amounts of labeled data. However, classroom Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
faces the real-world challenge of abundant weak transcripts paired with only a
small amount of accurate, gold-standard data. In such low-resource settings,
high transcription costs make re-transcription impractical. To address this, we
ask: what is the best approach when abundant inexpensive weak transcripts
coexist with limited gold-standard data, as is the case for classroom speech
data? We propose Weakly Supervised Pretraining (WSP), a two-step process where
models are first pretrained on weak transcripts in a supervised manner, and
then fine-tuned on accurate data. Our results, based on both synthetic and real
weak transcripts, show that WSP outperforms alternative methods, establishing
it as an effective training methodology for low-resource ASR in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM)
has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems.
Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity
of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to
understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic
speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available
to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by
halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for
TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the
pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text
instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions
during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to
building voice assistant for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Musical (MSS) source separation of western popular music using non-causal
deep learning can be very effective. In contrast, MSS for classical music is an
unsolved problem. Classical ensembles are harder to separate than popular music
because of issues such as the inherent greater variation in the music; the
sparsity of recordings with ground truth for supervised training; and greater
ambiguity between instruments. The Cadenza project has been exploring MSS for
classical music. This is being done so music can be remixed to improve
listening experiences for people with hearing loss. To enable the work, a new
database of synthesized woodwind ensembles was created to overcome instrumental
imbalances in the EnsembleSet. For the MSS, a set of ConvTasNet models was used
with each model being trained to extract a string or woodwind instrument.
ConvTasNet was chosen because it enabled both causal and non-causal approaches
to be tested. Non-causal approaches have dominated MSS work and are useful for
recorded music, but for live music or processing on hearing aids, causal signal
processing is needed. The MSS performance was evaluated on the two small
datasets (Bach10 and URMP) of real instrument recordings where the ground-truth
is available. The performances of the causal and non-causal systems were
similar. Comparing the average Signal-to-Distortion (SDR) of the synthesized
validation set (6.2 dB causal; 6.9 non-causal), to the real recorded evaluation
set (0.3 dB causal, 0.4 dB non-causal), shows that mismatch between synthesized
and recorded data is a problem. Future work needs to either gather more real
recordings that can be used for training, or to improve the realism and
diversity of the synthesized recordings to reduce the mismatch...

Method: 引入评估框架，生成数据集、标注XPath标签，采用结构感知指标评分，优化LLM输入格式（HTML slimming、Hierarchical JSON、Flat JSON），并创建公开合成数据集。

Result: Flat JSON输入使LLM在提取准确率（F1分数0.9567）和减少幻觉方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 框架为网页数据记录提取提供了标准化评估基础，推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Effective evaluation of web data record extraction methods is crucial, yet
hampered by static, domain-specific benchmarks and opaque scoring practices.
This makes fair comparison between traditional algorithmic techniques, which
rely on structural heuristics, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches,
offering zero-shot extraction across diverse layouts, particularly challenging.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a concrete evaluation framework.
Our framework systematically generates evaluation datasets from arbitrary MHTML
snapshots, annotates XPath-based supervision labels, and employs
structure-aware metrics for consistent scoring, specifically preventing text
hallucination and allowing only for the assessment of positional hallucination.
It also incorporates preprocessing strategies to optimize input for LLMs while
preserving DOM semantics: HTML slimming, Hierarchical JSON, and Flat JSON.
Additionally, we created a publicly available synthetic dataset by transforming
DOM structures and modifying content. We benchmark deterministic heuristic
algorithms and off-the-shelf LLMs across these multiple input formats. Our
benchmarking shows that Flat JSON input enables LLMs to achieve superior
extraction accuracy (F1 score of 0.9567) and minimal hallucination compared to
other input formats like Slimmed HTML and Hierarchical JSON. We establish a
standardized foundation for rigorous benchmarking, paving the way for the next
principled advancements in web data record extraction.

Motivation: 肾结石分割是识别结石类型的关键步骤，但手动分割因数据量大且持续增长而不切实际，因此探索自动化方法。

Method: 使用SAM与传统模型（U-Net、Residual U-Net、Attention U-Net）对比，评估其在肾结石分割中的性能。

Result: SAM在分布内数据上表现与U-Net相当（准确率97.68±3.04），但在分布外数据上泛化能力显著优于U-Net变体（提升达23%）。

Conclusion: SAM在肾结石分割中具有优越的适应性和效率，尤其在泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step
to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or
deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered
tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and
the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework --
is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The
performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including
U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency,
frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings
highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves
comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 +
3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly
enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing
all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.

*Hai Jiang,Qiongting Liu,Yuanpin Zhou,Jiawei Pan,Ting Song,Yao Lu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型卷积神经网络（CNN）架构，用于高效的一阶段多类别诊断胎盘植入谱系障碍（PAS）及其亚型，基于4,140张磁共振成像（MRI）切片。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎盘植入谱系障碍（PAS）在妊娠期间具有高风险，现有指南和方法主要关注PAS的存在，而亚型识别研究有限，且多类诊断通常依赖低效的两阶段级联二元分类任务。

Method: 设计了一个双分支CNN架构，主分类分支采用残差块结构，第二分支整合子宫胎盘区域和邻近子宫浆膜层的解剖特征，并采用多任务学习策略。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，该模型达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为PAS及其亚型的高效多类别诊断提供了一种创新方法，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during
pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean
deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity
correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate
prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta
increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing
guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with
limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous
multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage
cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient
one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main
classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising
multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical
features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to
enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement
a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively.
Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Jingzhi Hu,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蒸馏的知识对齐协议（DeKAP），通过低秩矩阵实现多任务知识对齐，显著降低通信和计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来网络中大量AI代理需协作完成任务，但各自专业知识不同，需知识对齐以支持语义通信。

Method: 提出DeKAP协议，将专家知识蒸馏为低秩矩阵并分配，通过整数线性规划和贪心算法优化对齐损失、通信开销和存储成本。

Result: 仿真表明，DeKAP在知识对齐中资源消耗最低。

Conclusion: DeKAP为多任务协作提供高效知识对齐方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence
(AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared
to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication
(SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless,
SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have
distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this
paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP),
which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient
low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to
simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the
joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost
as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly
efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes
knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources
compared to conventional approaches.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强的Residual U-Net架构，结合了CBAM和SAL两种注意力机制，用于早产儿脑超声图像中的脑室出血分割，取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产儿脑室出血（IVH）是一种严重的神经系统并发症，需要从脑超声图像中早期准确检测以改善临床结果。现有的深度学习方法在捕捉局部空间细节和全局上下文依赖方面仍有挑战。

Method: 提出了一种增强的Residual U-Net架构，结合了CBAM（卷积块注意力模块）和SAL（稀疏注意力层）。CBAM优化空间和通道特征，SAL通过稀疏注意力过滤低置信度信息并保留全局信息传播。

Result: 在脑超声数据集上的实验表明，该方法在脑室区域分割中达到了89.04%的Dice分数和81.84%的IoU，性能领先。

Conclusion: 结合空间优化和注意力稀疏性的方法在脑解剖结构检测中表现出色，为临床诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among
premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain
ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning
methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in
capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies
critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced
Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention
mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse
Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial
and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design,
sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise,
and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive
experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU
of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for
robust brain anatomy detection. Code is available at:

*Nayoung Kim,Seongsu Kim,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段生成金属有机框架（MOF）的方法，克服了现有模型依赖固定构建块和已知3D坐标的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型在生成MOF时依赖固定构建块和已知3D坐标，限制了设计新颖MOF的能力。

Method: 1. 使用基于SMILES的自回归模型生成新颖的金属和有机构建块；2. 引入流匹配模型预测平移、旋转和扭转角，组装为有效3D框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了重建准确性，生成了有效、新颖且独特的MOF，并能创造新颖构建块。

Conclusion: 该框架通过同时建模化学和几何自由度，扩展了MOF设计的可能性。

Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a
long-standing challenge due to their large combinatorial space and the complex
3D arrangements of building blocks. While recent deep generative models have
enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks
and (2) known ground-truth local block-wise 3D coordinates. However, this
limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure
using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage de novo MOF generation
framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and
geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train a SMILES-based autoregressive
model to generate novel metal and organic building blocks, paired with
cheminformatics for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a
flow-matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles
to assemble flexible blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments
demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel,
and unique MOFs, and the ability of our model to create novel building blocks.

*Shuai Wang,Song Jiang,Yizhou Sun,Judea Pearl,Ang Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用机器学习模型预测数据不足子群体的因果概率的方法，解决了传统方法需要大量数据的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于许多子群体的数据不足，传统方法无法准确估计因果概率（如PNS、PS、PN），因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用机器学习模型（如多层感知机MLP和Mish激活函数），从数据充足的子群体中学习，预测数据不足子群体的因果概率。

Result: 通过模拟实验，MLP模型在预测PNS时表现出色，平均绝对误差（MAE）约为0.02。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型可以有效预测数据不足子群体的因果概率，为决策提供支持。

Abstract: Probabilities of causation play a crucial role in modern decision-making.
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting probabilities of causation for
subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data using machine learning models.
Tian and Pearl first defined and derived tight bounds for three fundamental
probabilities of causation: the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS),
the probability of sufficiency (PS), and the probability of necessity (PN).
However, estimating these probabilities requires both experimental and
observational distributions specific to each subpopulation, which are often
unavailable or impractical to obtain with limited population-level data.
Therefore, for most subgroups, the amount of data they have is not enough to
guarantee the accuracy of their probabilities. Hence, to estimate these
probabilities for subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data, we propose
using machine learning models that draw insights from subpopulations with
sufficient data. Our evaluation of multiple machine learning models indicates
that, given the population-level data and an appropriate choice of machine
learning model and activation function, PNS can be effectively predicted.
Through simulation studies on multiple Structured Causal Models (SCMs), we show
that our multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with the Mish activation function
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately $0.02$ in predicting PNS
for $32,768$ subpopulations across most SCMs using data from only $2,000$
subpopulations with known PNS values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法（如逆概率加权）在处理训练数据分布不平衡时，面临倾向得分估计不准确和极端权重导致的不稳定性问题。

Method: 使用对抗性损失函数，结合分布鲁棒优化处理倾向得分不确定性，并通过加权Rademacher复杂度进行权重正则化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了因果推断中的倾向得分模糊性和统计不稳定性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Causal inference requires evaluating models on balanced distributions between
treatment and control groups, while training data often exhibits imbalance due
to historical decision-making policies. Most conventional statistical methods
address this distribution shift through inverse probability weighting (IPW),
which requires estimating propensity scores as an intermediate step. These
methods face two key challenges: inaccurate propensity estimation and
instability from extreme weights. We decompose the generalization error to
isolate these issues--propensity ambiguity and statistical instability--and
address them through an adversarial loss function. Our approach combines
distributionally robust optimization for handling propensity uncertainty with
weight regularization based on weighted Rademacher complexity. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over
existing methods.

Motivation: 改进SWF以提升其在公平回归中的性能，减少方差并提高收敛速度。

Method: 将Fokker-Planck方程的随机扩散项转换为Liouville PDE的传输问题，并引入Kantorovich势能近似Wasserstein重心。

Result: 改进后的SWF在训练和测试中收敛更快，方差更小，公平回归的准确性与公平性平衡表现优异。

Conclusion: 改进的SWF及其重心生成方法在公平回归中具有高效和优越的性能。

Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative
gradient flow, is applied to fair regression. We have improved the SWF in a few
aspects. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck
equation-based Monte Carlo is transformed to Liouville partial differential
equation (PDE)-based transport with density estimation, however, without the
diffusive term. Now, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is
approximated by the SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich
potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two
efforts improve the convergence in training and testing SWF and SWF barycenters
with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair
regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto
curves.

Result: 在合成和真实心血管风险数据集上，DWTS比标准LinTS表现更优。

Conclusion: DWTS证明了观测数据在提升试验效率和个性化治疗中的潜力。

Abstract: Randomized clinical trials often require large patient cohorts before drawing
definitive conclusions, yet abundant observational data from parallel studies
remains underutilized due to confounding and hidden biases. To bridge this gap,
we propose Deconfounded Warm-Start Thompson Sampling (DWTS), a practical
approach that leverages a Doubly Debiased LASSO (DDL) procedure to identify a
sparse set of reliable measured covariates and combines them with key hidden
covariates to form a reduced context. By initializing Thompson Sampling (LinTS)
priors with DDL-estimated means and variances on these measured features --
while keeping uninformative priors on hidden features -- DWTS effectively
harnesses confounded observational data to kick-start adaptive clinical trials.
Evaluated on both a purely synthetic environment and a virtual environment
created using real cardiovascular risk dataset, DWTS consistently achieves
lower cumulative regret than standard LinTS, showing how offline causal
insights from observational data can improve trial efficiency and support more
personalized treatment decisions.

Motivation: 研究目的是比较两种调整大语言模型适应新任务的方法在不同学习设置下的性能差异。

Method: 通过理论分析比较监督微调（SFT）和Best-of-N（BoN）在比特串生成问题上的表现。

Result: 在可实现的学习设置下，SFT表现优于BoN；在不可实现的情况下，BoN可能在某些情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 选择调整方法需根据学习设置的可实现性决定，SFT在可实现时更优，BoN在不可实现时可能更合适。

Abstract: Using the bit string generation problem as a case study, we theoretically
compare two standard methods for adapting large language models to new tasks.
The first, referred to as supervised fine-tuning, involves training a new next
token predictor on good generations. The second method, Best-of-N, trains a
reward model to select good responses from a collection generated by an
unaltered base model. If the learning setting is realizable, we find that
supervised fine-tuning outperforms BoN through a better dependence on the
response length in its rate of convergence. If realizability fails, then
depending on the failure mode, BoN can enjoy a better rate of convergence in
either n or a rate of convergence with better dependence on the response
length.

Result: 成功去偏并高效估计最优传输问题，验证了方法的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实际应用中均表现良好，为缺失数据的最优传输问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of solving the optimal transport problem between two
empirical distributions with missing values. Our main assumption is that the
data is missing completely at random (MCAR), but we allow for heterogeneous
missingness probabilities across features and across the two distributions. As
a first contribution, we show that the Wasserstein distance between empirical
Gaussian distributions and linear Monge maps between arbitrary distributions
can be debiased without significantly affecting the sample complexity.
Secondly, we show that entropic regularized optimal transport can be estimated
efficiently and consistently using iterative singular value thresholding
(ISVT). We propose a validation set-free hyperparameter selection strategy for
ISVT that leverages our estimator of the Bures-Wasserstein distance, which
could be of independent interest in general matrix completion problems.
Finally, we validate our findings on a wide range of numerical applications.

Abstract: Construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for functionals
based on asymptotically normal estimators is a classical topic in statistical
inference. The simplest and in many cases optimal inference procedure is the
Wald interval or the likelihood ratio test, both of which require an estimator
and an estimate of the asymptotic variance of the estimator. Estimators
obtained from online/sequential algorithms forces one to consider the
computational aspects of the inference problem, i.e., one cannot access all of
the data as many times as needed. Several works on this topic explored the
online estimation of asymptotic variance. In this article, we propose
computationally efficient, rate-optimal, and asymptotically valid confidence
regions based on the output of online algorithms {\em without} estimating the
asymptotic variance. As a special case, this implies inference from any
algorithm that yields an asymptotically normal estimator. We focus our efforts
on stochastic gradient descent with Polyak averaging to understand the
practical performance of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在解决微分方程反问题时，不确定性估计比点估计更为重要，因为它能提供解的准确性信息。传统集成方法倾向于收敛到最大后验解，而排斥性集成能提供更准确的不确定性估计和更高的样本多样性。

Method: 采用排斥性集成物理信息神经网络（RE-PINN），通过在损失函数中添加排斥项，使得集成预测在无限集成成员极限下逼近贝叶斯后验分布。

Result: 与标准集成方法相比，排斥性集成显著提高了不确定性估计的准确性，并表现出更高的样本多样性。

Conclusion: 排斥性集成PINN是一种有效的工具，能够为微分方程反问题提供更准确的不确定性估计，优于传统的最大后验解方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven an effective tool for
solving differential equations, in particular when considering non-standard or
ill-posed settings. When inferring solutions and parameters of the differential
equation from data, uncertainty estimates are preferable to point estimates, as
they give an idea about the accuracy of the solution. In this work, we consider
the inverse problem and employ repulsive ensembles of PINNs (RE-PINN) for
obtaining such estimates. The repulsion is implemented by adding a particular
repulsive term to the loss function, which has the property that the ensemble
predictions correspond to the true Bayesian posterior in the limit of infinite
ensemble members. Where possible, we compare the ensemble predictions to Monte
Carlo baselines. Whereas the standard ensemble tends to collapse to
maximum-a-posteriori solutions, the repulsive ensemble produces significantly
more accurate uncertainty estimates and exhibits higher sample diversity.

Result: 在多种模型规模和数据集上的实验表明，使用DataRater筛选数据显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: DataRater是一种高效且可扩展的数据筛选方法，能够显著提升模型训练效率。

Abstract: The quality of foundation models depends heavily on their training data.
Consequently, great efforts have been put into dataset curation. Yet most
approaches rely on manual tuning of coarse-grained mixtures of large buckets of
data, or filtering by hand-crafted heuristics. An approach that is ultimately
more scalable (let alone more satisfying) is to \emph{learn} which data is
actually valuable for training. This type of meta-learning could allow more
sophisticated, fine-grained, and effective curation. Our proposed
\emph{DataRater} is an instance of this idea. It estimates the value of
training on any particular data point. This is done by meta-learning using
`meta-gradients', with the objective of improving training efficiency on held
out data. In extensive experiments across a range of model scales and datasets,
we find that using our DataRater to filter data is highly effective, resulting
in significantly improved compute efficiency.

Abstract: We study offline constrained reinforcement learning (RL) with general
function approximation. We aim to learn a policy from a pre-collected dataset
that maximizes the expected discounted cumulative reward for a primary reward
signal while ensuring that expected discounted returns for multiple auxiliary
reward signals are above predefined thresholds. Existing algorithms either
require fully exploratory data, are computationally inefficient, or depend on
an additional auxiliary function classes to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy
with sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. In this paper, we propose an
oracle-efficient primal-dual algorithm based on a linear programming (LP)
formulation, achieving $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity under partial data
coverage. By introducing a realizability assumption, our approach ensures that
all saddle points of the Lagrangian are optimal, removing the need for
regularization that complicated prior analyses. Through Lagrangian
decomposition, our method extracts policies without requiring knowledge of the
data-generating distribution, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: This article studies the problem of online non-parametric change point
detection in multivariate data streams. We approach the problem through the
lens of kernel-based two-sample testing and introduce a sequential testing
procedure based on random Fourier features, running with logarithmic time
complexity per observation and with overall logarithmic space complexity. The
algorithm has two advantages compared to the state of the art. First, our
approach is genuinely online, and no access to training data known to be from
the pre-change distribution is necessary. Second, the algorithm does not
require the user to specify a window parameter over which local tests are to be
calculated. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's
performance, including information-theoretic bounds demonstrating that the
detection delay is optimal in the minimax sense. Numerical studies on real and
synthetic data show that our algorithm is competitive with respect to the state
of the art.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique which is
able to partition unlabelled data into disjoint clusters of distinct shapes.
However, the data under consideration are often experimental data, implying
that the data is subject to measurement errors and measurements may even be
lost or invalid. These uncertainties in the corrupted input data induce
corresponding uncertainties in the resulting clusters, and the clusterings thus
become unreliable.
  Modelling the uncertainties as random processes, we discuss a mathematical
framework based on random set theory for the computational Monte Carlo
approximation of statistically expected clusterings in case of corrupted, i.e.,
perturbed, incomplete, and possibly even additional, data. We propose several
computationally accessible quantities of interest and analyze their consistency
in the infinite data point and infinite Monte Carlo sample limit. Numerical
experiments are provided to illustrate and compare the proposed quantities.

Result: 理论分析表明，GoRank和GoTrim分别具有O(1/t)和O(log(t)/t)的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 实验验证了算法在不同网络拓扑和数据分布下的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms
over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized,
relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them
well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental
challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to
malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust
mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More
specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred
to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated
to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed
description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a
precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank
estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation,
where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a
breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our
theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data
distributions and contamination schemes.

Result: 连续变换器在无限深度极限下学习到贝叶斯最优预测器，并通过实验验证其最优性。

Conclusion: 连续变换器通过梯度下降实现上下文学习，具有理论支持的最优性能。

Abstract: Transformers robustly exhibit the ability to perform in-context learning,
whereby their predictive accuracy on a task can increase not by parameter
updates but merely with the placement of training samples in their context
windows. Recent works have shown that transformers achieve this by implementing
gradient descent in their forward passes. Such results, however, are restricted
to standard transformer architectures, which handle finite-dimensional inputs.
In the space of PDE surrogate modeling, a generalization of transformers to
handle infinite-dimensional function inputs, known as "continuum transformers,"
has been proposed and similarly observed to exhibit in-context learning.
Despite impressive empirical performance, such in-context learning has yet to
be theoretically characterized. We herein demonstrate that continuum
transformers perform in-context operator learning by performing gradient
descent in an operator RKHS. We demonstrate this using novel proof strategies
that leverage a generalized representer theorem for Hilbert spaces and gradient
flows over the space of functionals of a Hilbert space. We additionally show
the operator learned in context is the Bayes Optimal Predictor in the infinite
depth limit of the transformer. We then provide empirical validations of this
optimality result and demonstrate that the parameters under which such gradient
descent is performed are recovered through the continuum transformer training.

Abstract: We investigate the function space dynamics of a two-layer ReLU neural network
in the infinite-width limit, highlighting the Fisher information matrix (FIM)'s
role in steering learning. Extending seminal works on approximate
eigendecomposition of the FIM, we derive the asymptotic behavior of basis
functions ($f_v(x) = X^{\top} v $) for four groups of approximate eigenvectors,
showing their convergence to distinct function forms. These functions,
prioritized by gradient descent, exhibit FIM-induced inner products that
approximate orthogonality in the function space, forging a novel connection
between parameter and function spaces. Simulations validate the accuracy of
these theoretical approximations, confirming their practical relevance. By
refining the function space inner product's role, we advance the theoretical
framework for ReLU networks, illuminating their optimization and expressivity.
Overall, this work offers a robust foundation for understanding wide neural
networks and enhances insights into scalable deep learning architectures,
paving the way for improved design and analysis of neural networks.

Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous
indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within
a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we
compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect
Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we
apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space,
followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we
calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to
determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity
in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II
dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our
method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization
(ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations
trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and
test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex
matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity
control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned
feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield
precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function
governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass
methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep
link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.

  In this paper, we extend the PPI framework to the sequential setting, where
labelled and unlabelled datasets grow over time.
  Exploiting Ville's inequality and the method of mixtures, we propose
prediction-powered confidence sequence procedures that are valid uniformly over

predictions to further boost efficiency.
  We carefully illustrate the design choices behind our method and demonstrate
its effectiveness in real and synthetic examples.

Motivation: 传统离散选择模型（DCMs）在预测任务中表现不佳，而深度学习模型虽预测能力强但缺乏解释性和稳定性。

Method: 设计了一种深度学习架构，结合近似贝叶斯推断方法（如SGLD），在数据有限时退化为行为假设，避免过拟合。

Result: 通过蒙特卡洛模拟和实证案例（纽约交通模式选择和瑞士火车偏好数据）验证了模型在预测和推断指标上的优势。

Conclusion: 该模型在保持解释性的同时提升了预测能力，为离散选择分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making
in contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer
preferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling
inference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution,
rather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data.
However, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for
point and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often
underperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite
their predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete
choice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter
estimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty
quantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture
specifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods,
such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Our proposed model
collapses to behaviorally informed hypotheses when data is limited, mitigating
overfitting and instability in underspecified settings while retaining the
flexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships when sufficient data is
available. We demonstrate our approach using SGLD through a Monte Carlo
simulation study, evaluating both predictive metrics--such as out-of-sample
balanced accuracy--and inferential metrics--such as empirical coverage for
marginal rates of substitution interval estimates. Additionally, we present
results from two empirical case studies: one using revealed mode choice data in
NYC, and the other based on the widely used Swiss train choice stated
preference data.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了因果推断方法与实际老虎机算法之间的可扩展性差距，为大规模网络系统中的策略优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Many interventions, such as vaccines in clinical trials or coupons in online
marketplaces, must be assigned sequentially without full knowledge of their
effects. Multi-armed bandit algorithms have proven successful in such settings.
However, standard independence assumptions fail when the treatment status of
one individual impacts the outcomes of others, a phenomenon known as
interference. We study optimal-policy learning under interference on a dynamic
network. Existing approaches to this problem require repeated observations of
the same fixed network and struggle to scale in sample size beyond as few as
fifteen connected units -- both limit applications. We show that under common
assumptions on the structure of interference, rewards become linear. This
enables us to develop a scalable Thompson sampling algorithm that maximizes
policy impact when a new $n$-node network is observed each round. We prove a
Bayesian regret bound that is sublinear in $n$ and the number of rounds.
Simulation experiments show that our algorithm learns quickly and outperforms
existing methods. The results close a key scalability gap between causal
inference methods for interference and practical bandit algorithms, enabling
policy optimization in large-scale networked systems.

Method: 使用无安全限制的Moremi Bio Agent生成新型有毒蛋白质和小分子，并通过计算毒性评估和定量风险分析验证其潜在危害。

Result: 生成了1020种新型有毒蛋白质和5000种有毒小分子，其中许多与已知毒素高度相似，证实了LLMs设计生物武器的能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在生物设计中的双用途风险，呼吁采取多层次缓解策略和严格治理以平衡技术创新与生物安全。

Abstract: Advances in AI, particularly LLMs, have dramatically shortened drug discovery
cycles by up to 40% and improved molecular target identification. However,
these innovations also raise dual-use concerns by enabling the design of toxic
compounds. Prompting Moremi Bio Agent without the safety guardrails to
specifically design novel toxic substances, our study generated 1020 novel
toxic proteins and 5,000 toxic small molecules. In-depth computational toxicity
assessments revealed that all the proteins scored high in toxicity, with
several closely matching known toxins such as ricin, diphtheria toxin, and
disintegrin-based snake venom proteins. Some of these novel agents showed
similarities with other several known toxic agents including disintegrin
eristostatin, metalloproteinase, disintegrin triflavin, snake venom
metalloproteinase, corynebacterium ulcerans toxin. Through quantitative risk
assessments and scenario analyses, we identify dual-use capabilities in current
LLM-enabled biodesign pipelines and propose multi-layered mitigation
strategies. The findings from this toxicity assessment challenge claims that
large language models (LLMs) are incapable of designing bioweapons. This
reinforces concerns about the potential misuse of LLMs in biodesign, posing a
significant threat to research and development (R&D). The accessibility of such
technology to individuals with limited technical expertise raises serious
biosecurity risks. Our findings underscore the critical need for robust
governance and technical safeguards to balance rapid biotechnological
innovation with biosecurity imperatives.

TL;DR: 提出了一个资源为中心的建模与求解框架（REMS），用于统一解决多种组合优化问题（COPs），并通过设计的元启发式算法有效求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组合优化问题时，通常需要为每个问题开发定制算法，即使微小调整也可能需要重新开发。因此，建立一个统一框架以建模和求解多样化的COPs具有重要价值。

Method: 从COP中提取资源和任务，统一解决方案结构为将任务分配给资源，并设计基础操作符（如初始解、邻域结构、破坏与修复、交叉和排序）以开发元启发式算法。

Result: 在10种COPs上的实验表明，REMS能统一建模并有效求解这些问题，且在大规模实例和复杂COPs上优于GUROBI、SCIP和OR-TOOLS。

Conclusion: REMS为组合优化问题提供了一个通用的建模和求解框架，具有高效性和竞争力。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite
search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in
metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP
typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor
adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm
redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs
into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is
valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to
perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a
resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the
first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP.
Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified
as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and
constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the
modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified
solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure,
destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the
development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4
single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured
herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading,
assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model
these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the
designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than
GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and
outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.

Motivation: 遗传编程（GP）在演化非可微符号结构（如方程）时，由于难以同时发现有用表示和精确映射，泛化能力受限。论文旨在探索如何通过监督学习改进GP的性能。

Method: 提出LaSER（Latent Semantic Evolutionary Regression）方法，将GP个体的语义表示传递给监督学习器，通过学习映射的质量评估适应度，而不改变语法树或进化过程。

Result: 在符号回归基准测试中，LaSER的泛化能力显著优于传统GP，部分情况下甚至超过流行的机器学习回归方法，同时保持符号可解释性。

Conclusion: LaSER通过分离进化与学习，为GP与现代机器学习工作流的结合提供了实用途径，并开辟了进化计算与表示学习交叉研究的新方向。

Abstract: Evolution and learning are two distinct yet complementary forms of
adaptation. While evolutionary processes operate across generations via the
selection of genotypes, learning occurs within the lifetime of an individual,
shaping behavior through phenotypic adjustment. The Baldwin effect describes
how lifetime learning can improve evolutionary search without altering
inherited structures. While this has proven effective in areas like
neuroevolution, where gradient-based learning is often used to fine-tune
weights or behaviors produced by evolution, it remains underexplored in systems
that evolve non-differentiable symbolic structures like Genetic Programming
(GP). GP evolves explicit syntax trees that represent equations, offering
strong interpretability but limited generalization due to the burden of
discovering both useful representations and precise mappings.
  Here, we show for the first time that integrating a simple form of supervised
learning, applied at the semantic or behavioral level during evaluation, can
effectively guide the evolution of equations in GP. To achieve this, we propose
a new GP pipeline, LaSER (Latent Semantic Evolutionary Regression), where each
GP individual generates a semantic representation that is passed to a
supervised learner. The quality of the learned mapping is used to assign
fitness, without modifying the underlying syntax tree or evolutionary process.
  Across standard symbolic regression benchmarks, in terms of generalization
ability, LaSER significantly outperforms traditional GP and, in several cases,
matches or exceeds popular machine learning regressors, while preserving the
symbolic interpretability. By separating evolution from learning, LaSER offers
a practical route to integrating GP with modern ML workflows, and opens new
avenues for research at the intersection of evolutionary computation and
representation learning.

Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning
systems have focused on the development of application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs), which provide hardware specialized for the deployment of
neural networks, leading to potential gains in efficiency and performance.
These systems typically feature an architecture that goes beyond the von
Neumann architecture employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs. Neural
networks developed for this specialised hardware then need to take into account
the specifics of the hardware platform, which requires novel training
algorithms and accurate models of the hardware, since they cannot be abstracted
as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up
approach to train neural networks for hardware based on spiking neurons and
synapses built on ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap) and Resistive switching
non-volatile devices (RRAM) respectively. In contrast to the more common
approach of designing hardware to fit existing abstract neuron or synapse
models, this approach starts with compact models of the physical device to
model the computational primitive of the neurons. Based on these models, a
training algorithm is developed that can reliably backpropagate through these
physical models, even when applying common hardware limitations, such as
stochasticity, variability, and low bit precision. The training algorithm is
then tested on a spatio-temporal dataset with a network composed of quantized
synapses based on RRAM and ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF)
neurons. The performance of the network is compared with different networks
composed of LIF neurons. The results of the experiments show the potential
advantage of using BRUNO to train networks with FeLIF neurons, by achieving a
reduction in both time and memory for detecting spatio-temporal patterns with
quantized synapses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing when a target market can leverage K
auxiliary markets -- offline logs or concurrent streams -- whose mean utilities
differ by a structured preference shift. We propose Cross-Market Transfer
Dynamic Pricing (CM-TDP), the first algorithm that provably handles such
model-shift transfer and delivers minimax-optimal regret for both linear and
non-parametric utility models.
  For linear utilities of dimension d, where the difference between source- and
target-task coefficients is $s_{0}$-sparse, CM-TDP attains regret
$\tilde{O}((d*K^{-1}+s_{0})\log T)$. For nonlinear demand residing in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space with effective dimension $\alpha$, complexity
$\beta$ and task-similarity parameter $H$, the regret becomes
$\tilde{O}\!(K^{-2\alpha\beta/(2\alpha\beta+1)}T^{1/(2\alpha\beta+1)} +
H^{2/(2\alpha+1)}T^{1/(2\alpha+1)})$, matching information-theoretic lower
bounds up to logarithmic factors. The RKHS bound is the first of its kind for
transfer pricing and is of independent interest.
  Extensive simulations show up to 50% lower cumulative regret and 5 times
faster learning relative to single-market pricing baselines. By bridging
transfer learning, robust aggregation, and revenue optimization, CM-TDP moves
toward pricing systems that transfer faster, price smarter.

data. Yet, in practice, data are often decentralized across multiple sites,
making centralization infeasible due to privacy, logistical, or legal
constraints. We address this by estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
from decentralized observational data using federated learning, which enables
inference through the exchange of aggregate statistics rather than
individual-level data. We propose a novel method to estimate propensity scores
in a (non-)parametric manner by computing a federated weighted average of local
scores, using two theoretically grounded weighting schemes -- Membership
Weights (MW) and Density Ratio Weights (DW) -- that balance communication
efficiency and model flexibility. These federated scores are then used to
construct two ATE estimators: the Federated Inverse Propensity Weighting
estimator (Fed-IPW) and its augmented variant (Fed-AIPW). Unlike meta-analysis
methods, which fail when any site violates positivity, our approach leverages
heterogeneity in treatment assignment across sites to improve overlap. We show
that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW perform well under site-level heterogeneity in sample
sizes, treatment mechanisms, and covariate distributions, with theoretical
analysis and experiments on simulated and real-world data highlighting their
strengths and limitations relative to meta-analysis and related methods.

*Miruna Oprescu,Brian M Cho,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文研究了在自适应实验中通过二元工具变量间接鼓励治疗而非直接分配治疗的平均处理效应（ATE）估计问题。提出了一种方差感知分配规则，并开发了AMRIV估计器，结合在线策略和序列估计器，实现了半参数效率边界和多重鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自适应实验中通过工具变量间接鼓励治疗时ATE估计的效率问题，优化分配策略以提高估计精度。

Method: 基于半参数效率理论，推导ATE估计的效率边界，提出AMRIV估计器，结合在线分配策略和序列估计器。

Result: AMRIV估计器实现了半参数效率边界，具有多重鲁棒性，并通过实证研究验证了其效率和鲁棒性的提升。

Conclusion: AMRIV方法在自适应工具变量设置中显著提升了ATE估计的效率和鲁棒性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in
adaptive experiments where treatment can only be encouraged--rather than
directly assigned--via a binary instrumental variable. Building on
semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive the efficiency bound for ATE
estimation under arbitrary, history-dependent instrument-assignment policies,
and show it is minimized by a variance-aware allocation rule that balances
outcome noise and compliance variability. Leveraging this insight, we introduce
AMRIV--an \textbf{A}daptive, \textbf{M}ultiply-\textbf{R}obust estimator for
\textbf{I}nstrumental-\textbf{V}ariable settings with variance-optimal
assignment. AMRIV pairs (i) an online policy that adaptively approximates the
optimal allocation with (ii) a sequential, influence-function-based estimator
that attains the semiparametric efficiency bound while retaining
multiply-robust consistency. We establish asymptotic normality, explicit
convergence rates, and anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences that
enable sequential inference. Finally, we demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of our approach through empirical studies, showing that adaptive
instrument assignment, when combined with the AMRIV estimator, yields improved
efficiency and robustness compared to existing baselines.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力机制的动态路由方法，用于研究视觉特征如何动态传递到高级视觉区域，显著优于传统线性编码模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经科学的主要目标是理解自然场景下的视觉处理计算。传统线性编码方法忽略了特征图的结构，且参数调整复杂，因此需要更高效且可解释的模型。

Method: 采用Transformer架构中的注意力机制，动态路由视网膜视觉特征到高级视觉区域，避免静态感受野的限制。

Result: 该方法在预测自然场景观看时的大脑活动方面显著优于其他方法，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种机制模型，说明视觉信息如何基于输入内容的相关性动态路由到不同类别选择区域。

Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during
visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use
image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as
a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring tuning a
large number of parameters, the linear encoding approach ignores the structure
of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed
alternatives have focused on decomposing the linear mapping to spatial and
feature components but focus on finding static receptive fields for units that
are applicable only in early visual areas. In this work, we employ the
attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how
retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective
areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is
significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain
activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models
and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more
interpretable, without the need to create importance maps, by interpreting the
attention routing signal for different high-level categorical areas. Our
approach proposes a mechanistic model of how visual information from
retinotopic maps can be routed based on the relevance of the input content to
different category-selective regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出Archias专家模型，用于解决LLM在生产环境中的安全问题，如越狱和提示注入，并通过分类用户查询提升模型响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生产环境中面临安全挑战，如越狱和提示注入，且通用LLM难以适应特定领域需求。

Method: 引入Archias专家模型，分类用户查询（如领域内、恶意问题等），并将其输出整合到LLM提示中以生成响应。

Result: Archias提升了LLM对用户意图的理解能力，且因其小巧灵活，可适应多种行业需求。

Conclusion: Archias有效解决了LLM在特定领域的安全和适应性问题，并发布了汽车行业基准数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that
include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result
in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified
when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to
address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for
example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and
security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak
techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the
flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and
in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these
challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing
between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user
inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive
industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and
out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert
model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate
responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's
intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned,
and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can
be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we
created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the
interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark
dataset to the community.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过显式引入安全相关的二元分类任务，结合注意力与解码策略，显著提升大语言模型（LLMs）对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全对齐方法往往表面化，容易受到对抗攻击，且缺乏有效的解决方案。本文发现其根本原因是现有方法假设模型能隐式学习安全相关推理任务，但实际上安全信号常被其他目标稀释。

Method: 通过显式引入安全相关的二元分类任务，并结合注意力与解码策略，明确模型的安全决策边界。

Result: 实验表明，该方法以低于0.2倍的额外成本，显著提升了LLMs对抗多种对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更鲁棒的生成式AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have
revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models
vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these
studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation
for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a
fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often
presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during
the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the
learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading
models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when
confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly
introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its
signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity
and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize
that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess
the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each
necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial
attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非概率性风险管理策略，用于应对大型语言模型（LLM）带来的新兴风险，包括自适应对手的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的能力不断增强，但同时也带来了复杂的安全和风险挑战，传统的概率风险分析（PRA）方法难以应对这些挑战。

Method: 研究提出了100多种非概率性风险管理策略，分为五类，并展示了如何将这些策略应用于LLM安全和AI安全领域。此外，还提供了一个基于LLM的工作流程。

Result: 这些策略可以提升LLM系统的安全性、安全性及其他负责任AI的维度，尽管存在一些局限性。

Conclusion: 非概率性风险管理策略为LLM和AI安全提供了一种可行的解决方案，能够应对新兴风险和自适应对手的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented and growing capabilities,
but also introduce complex safety and security challenges that resist
conventional risk management. While conventional probabilistic risk analysis
(PRA) requires exhaustive risk enumeration and quantification, the novelty and
complexity of these systems make PRA impractical, particularly against adaptive
adversaries. Previous research found that risk management in various fields of
engineering such as nuclear or civil engineering is often solved by generic
(i.e. field-agnostic) strategies such as event tree analysis or robust designs.
Here we show how emerging risks in LLM-powered systems could be met with 100+
of these non-probabilistic strategies to risk management, including risks from
adaptive adversaries. The strategies are divided into five categories and are
mapped to LLM security (and AI safety more broadly). We also present an
LLM-powered workflow for applying these strategies and other workflows suitable
for solution architects. Overall, these strategies could contribute (despite
some limitations) to security, safety and other dimensions of responsible AI.

TL;DR: GSDFuse是一种新方法，通过多模态特征工程、数据增强、自适应证据融合和判别嵌入学习，解决了社交媒体中恶意隐写术检测的核心难题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的普及导致恶意隐写术泛滥，带来安全风险。现有检测方法因文本碎片化、对话结构复杂、隐写稀疏性和数据不平衡等问题而受限。

Method: GSDFuse采用分层多模态特征工程捕捉多样化信号，数据增强应对稀疏性，自适应证据融合智能聚合弱信号，判别嵌入学习增强对细微不一致的敏感性。

Result: 在社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，GSDFuse在复杂对话环境中识别高级隐写术方面表现优异，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: GSDFuse通过系统化方法克服了隐写术检测的核心难题，为社交媒体安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ubiquity of social media platforms facilitates malicious linguistic
steganography, posing significant security risks. Steganalysis is profoundly
hindered by the challenge of identifying subtle cognitive inconsistencies
arising from textual fragmentation and complex dialogue structures, and the
difficulty in achieving robust aggregation of multi-dimensional weak signals,
especially given extreme steganographic sparsity and sophisticated
steganography. These core detection difficulties are compounded by significant
data imbalance. This paper introduces GSDFuse, a novel method designed to
systematically overcome these obstacles. GSDFuse employs a holistic approach,
synergistically integrating hierarchical multi-modal feature engineering to
capture diverse signals, strategic data augmentation to address sparsity,
adaptive evidence fusion to intelligently aggregate weak signals, and
discriminative embedding learning to enhance sensitivity to subtle
inconsistencies. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate GSDFuse's
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in identifying sophisticated steganography
within complex dialogue environments. The source code for GSDFuse is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在网络安全任务中无法获取最新专业知识及整合新知识到复杂任务规划的局限性。

Method: 提出CRAKEN框架，包含任务关键信息分解、迭代自反知识检索和知识提示注入三个核心机制。

Result: 在NYU CTF Bench上准确率22%，优于现有方法3%；在MITRE ATT&CK技术评估中解决25-30%更多技术。

Conclusion: CRAKEN通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了LLM代理的网络安全能力，并开源框架以促进研究。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can automate cybersecurity tasks and can
adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape without re-engineering. While LLM
agents have demonstrated cybersecurity capabilities on Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
competitions, they have two key limitations: accessing latest cybersecurity
expertise beyond training data, and integrating new knowledge into complex task
planning. Knowledge-based approaches that incorporate technical understanding
into the task-solving automation can tackle these limitations. We present
CRAKEN, a knowledge-based LLM agent framework that improves cybersecurity
capability through three core mechanisms: contextual decomposition of
task-critical information, iterative self-reflected knowledge retrieval, and
knowledge-hint injection that transforms insights into adaptive attack
strategies. Comprehensive evaluations with different configurations show
CRAKEN's effectiveness in multi-stage vulnerability detection and exploitation
compared to previous approaches. Our extensible architecture establishes new
methodologies for embedding new security knowledge into LLM-driven
cybersecurity agentic systems. With a knowledge database of CTF writeups,
CRAKEN obtained an accuracy of 22% on NYU CTF Bench, outperforming prior works
by 3% and achieving state-of-the-art results. On evaluation of MITRE ATT&CK
techniques, CRAKEN solves 25-30% more techniques than prior work, demonstrating
improved cybersecurity capabilities via knowledge-based execution. We make our
framework open source to public

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在金融、教育和治理等领域的广泛应用，数据隐私和安全问题日益突出，亟需一种机制来保护敏感数据。

Method: 框架包含三个创新点：LLM驱动的政策执行、动态政策定制和敏感数据匿名化技术。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在降低安全风险的同时，保持了LLM任务的功能准确性。

Conclusion: 该安全框架为LLM应用中的数据隐私和安全问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in fields such as
finance, education, and governance due to their ability to generate human-like
text and adapt to specialized tasks. However, their widespread adoption raises
critical concerns about data privacy and security, including the risk of
sensitive data exposure.
  In this paper, we propose a security framework to enforce policy compliance
and mitigate risks in LLM interactions. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: (i) LLM-based policy enforcement: a customizable mechanism that
enhances domain-specific detection of sensitive data. (ii) Dynamic policy
customization: real-time policy adaptation and enforcement during user-LLM
interactions to ensure compliance with evolving security requirements. (iii)
Sensitive data anonymization: a format-preserving encryption technique that
protects sensitive information while maintaining contextual integrity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates
security risks while preserving the functional accuracy of LLM-driven tasks.

Result: 实验表明，红队模型表现出最先进的攻击能力，而目标模型在安全基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MTSA框架有效提升了多轮对话中语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: The proliferation of jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs)
highlights the need for robust security measures. However, in multi-round
dialogues, malicious intentions may be hidden in interactions, leading LLMs to
be more prone to produce harmful responses. In this paper, we propose the
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{T}urn \textbf{S}afety \textbf{A}lignment (\ourapproach)
framework, to address the challenge of securing LLMs in multi-round
interactions. It consists of two stages: In the thought-guided attack learning
stage, the red-team model learns about thought-guided multi-round jailbreak
attacks to generate adversarial prompts. In the adversarial iterative
optimization stage, the red-team model and the target model continuously
improve their respective capabilities in interaction. Furthermore, we introduce
a multi-turn reinforcement learning algorithm based on future rewards to
enhance the robustness of safety alignment. Experimental results show that the
red-team model exhibits state-of-the-art attack capabilities, while the target
model significantly improves its performance on safety benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对ALMs的安全评估工具和数据集，尤其是对抗音频攻击的研究不足。

Method: 提出JALMBench，包含2200个文本样本和51381个音频样本，支持12种ALMs、8种攻击方法和5种防御方法。

Result: 深入分析了攻击效率、主题敏感性、语音多样性和攻击表示，并探索了提示和响应级别的缓解策略。

Conclusion: JALMBench填补了ALMs安全性评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have made significant progress recently. These
models integrate the audio modality directly into the model, rather than
converting speech into text and inputting text to Large Language Models (LLMs).
While jailbreak attacks on LLMs have been extensively studied, the security of
ALMs with audio modalities remains largely unexplored. Currently, there is a
lack of an adversarial audio dataset and a unified framework specifically
designed to evaluate and compare attacks and ALMs. In this paper, we present
JALMBench, the \textit{first} comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of
ALMs against jailbreak attacks. JALMBench includes a dataset containing 2,200
text samples and 51,381 audio samples with over 268 hours. It supports 12
mainstream ALMs, 4 text-transferred and 4 audio-originated attack methods, and
5 defense methods. Using JALMBench, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack
efficiency, topic sensitivity, voice diversity, and attack representations.
Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies for the attacks at both the
prompt level and the response level.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Range-Arithmetic的新框架，用于高效且可验证的DNN推理，将非算术操作转换为可验证的算术步骤，降低了验证的计算成本和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化机器学习系统中，由于区块链的限制，资源密集型任务（如DNN推理）被外包给外部参与者，因此需要在不重新执行的情况下验证外包计算的正确性。

Method: 通过将非算术操作（如固定点矩阵乘法后的舍入和ReLU）转换为可验证的算术步骤，利用sum-check协议和范围证明，避免了布尔编码、高次多项式和大查找表的复杂性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法不仅与现有方法性能相当，还降低了验证结果的计算成本、不可信方的计算负担以及双方的通信开销。

Conclusion: Range-Arithmetic框架提供了一种高效且兼容有限域证明系统的可验证DNN推理方法，显著优化了验证过程。

Abstract: Verifiable computing (VC) has gained prominence in decentralized machine
learning systems, where resource-intensive tasks like deep neural network (DNN)
inference are offloaded to external participants due to blockchain limitations.
This creates a need to verify the correctness of outsourced computations
without re-execution. We propose \texttt{Range-Arithmetic}, a novel framework
for efficient and verifiable DNN inference that transforms non-arithmetic
operations, such as rounding after fixed-point matrix multiplication and ReLU,
into arithmetic steps verifiable using sum-check protocols and concatenated
range proofs. Our approach avoids the complexity of Boolean encoding,
high-degree polynomials, and large lookup tables while remaining compatible
with finite-field-based proof systems. Experimental results show that our
method not only matches the performance of existing approaches, but also
reduces the computational cost of verifying the results, the computational
effort required from the untrusted party performing the DNN inference, and the
communication overhead between the two sides.

TL;DR: 开放权重的通用AI模型带来显著好处，但也增加了网络安全风险，如DeepSeek-R1在MITRE OCCULT评估中展示的攻击能力。本文分析了开放权重AI模型放大的威胁，评估了现有法规的不足，并提出了针对高风险能力的管控建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放权重的AI模型使更多行为者能够自动化和规模化网络攻击，挑战传统防御和监管模式，亟需研究其威胁和应对策略。

Method: 分析了开放权重AI模型的具体威胁（如加速恶意软件开发和增强社交工程），评估了现有法规（如欧盟AI法案和GPAI行为准则）的不足。

Result: 发现开放分发导致控制缺失，使许多标准安全缓解措施失效，现有法规存在显著漏洞。

Conclusion: 建议聚焦于评估和控制特定高风险能力而非整个模型，推动务实政策解读、防御性AI创新及国际合作，以平衡安全与技术进步。

Abstract: Open-weight general-purpose AI (GPAI) models offer significant benefits but
also introduce substantial cybersecurity risks, as demonstrated by the
offensive capabilities of models like DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations such as
MITRE's OCCULT. These publicly available models empower a wider range of actors
to automate and scale cyberattacks, challenging traditional defence paradigms
and regulatory approaches. This paper analyzes the specific threats --
including accelerated malware development and enhanced social engineering --
magnified by open-weight AI release. We critically assess current regulations,
notably the EU AI Act and the GPAI Code of Practice, identifying significant
gaps stemming from the loss of control inherent in open distribution, which
renders many standard security mitigations ineffective. We propose a path
forward focusing on evaluating and controlling specific high-risk capabilities
rather than entire models, advocating for pragmatic policy interpretations for
open-weight systems, promoting defensive AI innovation, and fostering
international collaboration on standards and cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
sharing to ensure security without unduly stifling open technological progress.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于互信息和相关性的增量特征子集选择方法（INFS-MICC），用于检测HTTP洪水攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTTP协议因其多功能性和易集成性成为攻击目标，且默认情况下无检测系统拦截HTTP流量，导致攻击频发。

Method: 采用INFS-MICC方法，通过选择高度相关且独立的特征子集，实现近实时的高效分类检测。

Result: 该方法能有效识别HTTP洪水攻击，并提升分类性能。

Conclusion: INFS-MICC为HTTP洪水攻击检测提供了一种高效且实时的解决方案。

Abstract: Applications over the Web primarily rely on the HTTP protocol to transmit web
pages to and from systems. There are a variety of application layer protocols,
but among all, HTTP is the most targeted because of its versatility and ease of
integration with online services. The attackers leverage the fact that by
default no detection system blocks any HTTP traffic. Thus, by exploiting such
characteristics of the protocol, attacks are launched against web applications.
HTTP flooding attacks are one such attack in the application layer of the OSI
model. In this paper, a method for the detection of such an attack is proposed.
The heart of the detection method is an incremental feature subset selection
method based on mutual information and correlation. INFS-MICC helps in
identifying a subset of highly relevant and independent feature subset so as to
detect HTTP Flooding attacks with best possible classification performance in
near-real time.

Motivation: 研究主动攻击者如何利用被动安全的MPC训练协议进行攻击，揭示其潜在风险，推动主动安全协议的应用。

Method: 通过具体、简单且有效的攻击方式，测试现有被动安全MPC训练协议的漏洞。

Result: 攻击可以破坏模型的完整性和隐私性，甚至精确重构训练数据，且几乎无法被检测。

Conclusion: 研究表明被动安全威胁模型在隐私保护机器学习（PPML）中可能不足，应优先使用主动安全协议。

Abstract: Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows data owners to train machine
learning models on combined data while keeping the underlying training data
private. The MPC threat model either considers an adversary who passively
corrupts some parties without affecting their overall behavior, or an adversary
who actively modifies the behavior of corrupt parties. It has been argued that
in some settings, active security is not a major concern, partly because of the
potential risk of reputation loss if a party is detected cheating.
  In this work we show explicit, simple, and effective attacks that an active
adversary can run on existing passively secure MPC training protocols, while
keeping essentially zero risk of the attack being detected. The attacks we show
can compromise both the integrity and privacy of the model, including attacks
reconstructing exact training data. Our results challenge the belief that a
threat model that does not include malicious behavior by the involved parties
may be reasonable in the context of PPML, motivating the use of actively secure
protocols for training.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the human brain's neural architecture, is
revolutionizing artificial intelligence and edge computing with its low-power,
adaptive, and event-driven designs. However, these unique characteristics
introduce novel cybersecurity risks. This paper proposes Neuromorphic Mimicry
Attacks (NMAs), a groundbreaking class of threats that exploit the
probabilistic and non-deterministic nature of neuromorphic chips to execute
covert intrusions. By mimicking legitimate neural activity through techniques
such as synaptic weight tampering and sensory input poisoning, NMAs evade
traditional intrusion detection systems, posing risks to applications such as
autonomous vehicles, smart medical implants, and IoT networks. This research
develops a theoretical framework for NMAs, evaluates their impact using a
simulated neuromorphic chip dataset, and proposes countermeasures, including
neural-specific anomaly detection and secure synaptic learning protocols. The
findings underscore the critical need for tailored cybersecurity measures to
protect brain-inspired computing, offering a pioneering exploration of this
emerging threat landscape.

Abstract: In the era of rapid generative AI development, interactions between humans
and large language models face significant misusing risks. Previous research
has primarily focused on black-box scenarios using human-guided prompts and
white-box scenarios leveraging gradient-based LLM generation methods,
neglecting the possibility that LLMs can act not only as victim models, but
also as attacker models to harm other models. We proposes a novel jailbreaking
method inspired by the Chain-of-Thought mechanism, where the attacker model
uses mission transfer to conceal harmful user intent in dialogue and generates
chained narrative lures to stimulate the reasoning capabilities of victim
models, leading to successful jailbreaking. To enhance the attack success rate,
we introduce a helper model that performs random narrative optimization on the
narrative lures during multi-turn dialogues while ensuring alignment with the
original intent, enabling the optimized lures to bypass the safety barriers of
victim models effectively. Our experiments reveal that models with weaker
safety mechanisms exhibit stronger attack capabilities, demonstrating that
models can not only be exploited, but also help harm others. By incorporating
toxicity scores, we employ third-party models to evaluate the harmfulness of
victim models' responses to jailbreaking attempts. The study shows that using
refusal keywords as an evaluation metric for attack success rates is
significantly flawed because it does not assess whether the responses guide
harmful questions, while toxicity scores measure the harm of generated content
with more precision and its alignment with harmful questions. Our approach
demonstrates outstanding performance, uncovering latent vulnerabilities in LLMs
and providing data-driven feedback to optimize LLM safety mechanisms. We also
discuss two defensive strategies to offer guidance on improving defense
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法难以应对快速发展的防御机制，如防御性后缀，因此需要一种更强大的攻击方法。

Method: ArrAttack通过训练一个通用鲁棒性判断模型，快速生成能够绕过多种防御的恶意提示。

Result: 实验表明，ArrAttack在多种模型（包括GPT-4和Claude-3）上表现优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: ArrAttack填补了对抗攻击与防御之间的差距，为生成鲁棒性恶意提示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised
by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or
unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model
vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace
with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes,
rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we
introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to
target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak
prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is
supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can
perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of
defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak
prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into
effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly
outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability
across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our
work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh
perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts. We make the codebase
available at https://github.com/LLBao/ArrAttack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统拓扑优化易陷入局部最优、仿真成本高的问题，实现多功能设备设计。

Method: 结合早期终止的拓扑优化、Vision Transformer变分自编码器和贝叶斯搜索，压缩结构到潜在空间并优化几何与物理参数。

Result: 设计出性能优于现有技术的消色差光束偏转器，衍射效率达25%，仿真次数减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: HiLAB为稳健、多参数光子设计提供了灵活平台，适应未来纳米光子挑战。

Abstract: HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based
partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse
design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological
optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE)
and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by
generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs.
Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters,
produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a
compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize
geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused
for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition
function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB
systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer
electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the
total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude,
accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its
efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green,
and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while
mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing
demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust,
multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation
nanophotonic challenges.

Abstract: The explosive growth of global data traffic demands scalable and
energy-efficient optical communication systems. Spatial division multiplexing
(SDM) using multicore or multimode fibers is a promising solution to overcome
the capacity limit of single-mode fibers. However, long-haul SDM transmission
faces significant challenges due to modal dispersion, which imposes heavy
computational loads on digital signal processing (DSP) for signal equalization.
Here, we propose parameterized SDM transmission, where programmable photonic
unitary processors are installed at intermediate nodes. Instead of relying on
conventional digital equalization only on the receiver side, our approach
enables direct optimization of the SDM transmission channel itself by the
programmable unitary processor, which reduces digital post-processing loads. We
introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a differentiable SDM
transmission model to determine the optimal unitary transformation. As a key
enabler, we first implemented telecom-grade programmable photonic unitary
processor, achieving a low-loss (2.1 dB fiber-to-fiber), wideband (full
C-band), polarization-independent, and high-fidelity (R2>96% across the C-band)
operation. We experimentally demonstrate 1300-km transmission using a
three-mode fiber, achieving strong agreement between simulation and experiment.
The optimized photonic processor significantly reduces modal dispersion and
post-processing complexity. Our results establish a scalable framework for
integrating photonic computation into the optical layer, enabling more
efficient, high-capacity optical networks.

### [1] [Guiding Giants: Lightweight Controllers for Weighted Activation Steering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20309)
*Amr Hegazy,Mostafa Elhoushi,Amr Alanwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、可训练的控制器网络，用于在推理时动态调整LLM的行为，避免生成不安全内容，且不修改原始模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏细粒度和自适应性，无法有效控制LLM生成不安全内容或违反安全指南的行为。

Method: 通过集成控制器网络，观察中间激活并预测全局缩放因子和层特定权重，动态调整预计算的“拒绝方向”向量。

Result: 在ToxicChat等安全基准测试中，显著提高了拒绝率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、自适应的细粒度控制手段，适用于推理时行为调整。

Abstract: Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the
generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often
relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for
inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained,
adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight,
trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller
network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a
global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling
factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a
steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied
across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both
harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply
nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful
inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller
significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving
targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model
parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show
our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive
method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

### [2] [Arctic-Text2SQL-R1: Simple Rewards, Strong Reasoning in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20315)
*Zhewei Yao,Guoheng Sun,Lukasz Borchmann,Zheyu Shen,Minghang Deng,Bohan Zhai,Hao Zhang,Ang Li,Yuxiong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在生成准确且可执行的 SQL，通过轻量级奖励信号实现，无需复杂监督或奖励设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言转 SQL（Test2SQL）是一个长期挑战，尽管大语言模型提高了 SQL 生成的流畅性，但生成正确且可执行的 SQL（尤其是复杂查询）仍是瓶颈。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，仅基于执行正确性的轻量级奖励信号，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计，结合精选数据、强监督初始化和有效训练实践。

Result: 在六个 Test2SQL 基准测试中达到最先进的执行准确率，7B 模型超越之前 70B 级系统，并在 BIRD 排行榜上位居榜首。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了可扩展性和效率，并通过简单扩展（如值检索和多数投票）增强了推理时的鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Test2SQL) is a longstanding challenge
at the intersection of natural language understanding and structured data
access. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved fluency
in SQL generation, producing correct and executable SQL--particularly for
complex queries--remains a bottleneck. We present Arctic-Text2SQL-R1, a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model family designed to generate
accurate, executable SQL using a lightweight reward signal based solely on
execution correctness. Our approach avoids brittle intermediate supervision and
complex reward shaping, promoting stable training and alignment with the end
task. Combined with carefully curated data, strong supervised initialization,
and effective training practices, Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
execution accuracy across six diverse Test2SQL benchmarks, including the top
position on the BIRD leaderboard. Notably, our 7B model outperforms prior
70B-class systems, highlighting the framework's scalability and efficiency. We
further demonstrate inference-time robustness through simple extensions like
value retrieval and majority voting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
offer both positive and negative insights, providing practical guidance for
future Test2SQL research.

### [3] [Beyond Demonstrations: Dynamic Vector Construction from Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20318)
*Wang Cai,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Zhixiang Wang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyVec是一种动态向量方法，通过EQR策略提取语义聚合的潜在表示，并动态分割和注入这些表示，优于少样本ICL和现有ICV方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICV方法对ICL特定因素敏感，表示粗糙或语义碎片化，且依赖启发式注入位置，限制了其适用性。

Method: DyVec采用EQR策略提取鲁棒的语义聚合潜在表示，动态分割和注入表示，并通过REINFORCE优化学习最佳注入位置。

Result: 实验显示DyVec优于少样本ICL、LoRA和现有ICV基线，动态分割和注入语义聚合表示效果显著。

Conclusion: DyVec为推理时任务适应提供了轻量级且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations
from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving
comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated
demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to
ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented
representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based
injection positions, limiting their applicability.
  To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which
incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust
semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance
introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to
adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages
REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each
segment.
  Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior
ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically
segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec
provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task
adaptation.

### [4] [Less Context, Same Performance: A RAG Framework for Resource-Efficient LLM-Based Clinical NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20320)
*Satya Narayana Cheetirala,Ganesh Raut,Dhavalkumar Patel,Fabio Sanatana,Robert Freeman,Matthew A Levin,Girish N. Nadkarni,Omar Dawkins,Reba Miller,Randolph M. Steinhagen,Eyal Klang,Prem Timsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用RAG方法仅处理相关文本片段是否能在长文本分类任务中达到与处理完整临床笔记相同的效果，结果表明RAG在减少token使用的同时保持了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长文本分类中因token限制和高计算成本带来的挑战。

Method: 将临床文档分块并转换为向量嵌入，存储于FAISS索引中，检索最相关的4000词段输入LLM进行分类。

Result: 在手术并发症识别任务中，RAG方法与完整文本处理在AUC ROC、精确率、召回率和F1分数上无显著差异（p > 0.05）。

Conclusion: RAG方法可显著减少token使用且不牺牲分类准确性，为长临床文档分析提供了可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Long text classification is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due
to token limits and high computational costs. This study explores whether a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text
segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with
large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller
chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS
index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the
classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We
evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication
identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed
no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and
whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can
significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy,
providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical
documents.

### [5] [BiomedSQL: Text-to-SQL for Scientific Reasoning on Biomedical Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20321)
*Mathew J. Koretsky,Maya Willey,Adi Asija,Owen Bianchi,Chelsea X. Alvarado,Tanay Nayak,Nicole Kuznetsov,Sungwon Kim,Mike A. Nalls,Daniel Khashabi,Faraz Faghri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiomedSQL是一个针对生物医学领域文本到SQL转换的基准测试，旨在评估科学推理能力，包含68,000个问题/SQL查询/答案三元组。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL系统在生物医学领域难以处理需要隐含领域推理的科学问题，BiomedSQL填补了这一空白。

Method: 基于BigQuery知识库构建BiomedSQL，整合基因-疾病关联、组学数据因果推断和药物审批记录，评估多种LLM的性能。

Result: GPT-o3-mini执行准确率为59.0%，定制多步代理BMSQL为62.6%，均远低于专家基线90.0%。

Conclusion: BiomedSQL为提升文本到SQL系统的科学推理能力提供了新基础，支持对结构化生物医学知识库的稳健推理。

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases
for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often
struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL,
particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce
BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific
reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge
base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in
a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations,
causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question
requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide
significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering,
rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open-
and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms.
Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0%
execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%,
both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new
foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific
discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases.

### [6] [Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20322)
*Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Shengyu Mao,Shumin Deng,Zhaopeng Tu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Steering Target Atoms (STA)的新方法，通过分离和操作知识组件来增强语言模型的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的控制对安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有方法（如提示工程和干预）因参数众多且内部表征高度交织，导致控制精度受限和副作用。

Method: 提出STA方法，利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）分离高维空间中的知识组件，并对其进行操作。

Result: 实验证明STA方法有效，尤其在对抗场景中表现出优越的鲁棒性和灵活性，且适用于大型推理模型的精确控制。

Conclusion: STA方法为语言模型的安全性和精确控制提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both
safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly
used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models
often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This
interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended
side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE)
to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However,
these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue
of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering
Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled
knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering
exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial
scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model,
confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

### [7] [PMOA-TTS: Introducing the PubMed Open Access Textual Times Series Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20323)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Sayantan Kumar,George H. Chen,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PMOA-TTS是首个公开的大规模临床叙事时间标注数据集，包含124,699篇PubMed Open Access病例报告，通过LLM管道提取5.6百万个时间标记事件，验证了时间线质量，并在生存预测任务中展示了预测价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙事的时间动态建模需要大规模时间标注资源，但现有资源有限。

Method: 结合启发式过滤和Llama 3.3识别单病例报告，使用Llama 3.3和DeepSeek R1提取事件和时间线，并通过三项指标评估质量。

Result: 事件匹配率80%，时间一致性c-index > 0.90，时间戳对齐AULTC表现良好；在生存预测任务中时间依赖一致性指数达0.82。

Conclusion: PMOA-TTS为生物医学NLP中的时间线提取和时间建模提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in clinical narratives is essential for
modeling patient trajectories, yet large-scale temporally annotated resources
remain limited. We present PMOA-TTS, the first openly available dataset of
124,699 PubMed Open Access (PMOA) case reports, each converted into structured
(event, time) timelines via a scalable LLM-based pipeline. Our approach
combines heuristic filtering with Llama 3.3 to identify single-patient case
reports, followed by prompt-driven extraction using Llama 3.3 and DeepSeek R1,
resulting in over 5.6 million timestamped clinical events. To assess timeline
quality, we evaluate against a clinician-curated reference set using three
metrics: (i) event-level matching (80% match at a cosine similarity threshold
of 0.1), (ii) temporal concordance (c-index > 0.90), and (iii) Area Under the
Log-Time CDF (AULTC) for timestamp alignment. Corpus-level analysis shows wide
diagnostic and demographic coverage. In a downstream survival prediction task,
embeddings from extracted timelines achieve time-dependent concordance indices
up to 0.82 $\pm$ 0.01, demonstrating the predictive value of temporally
structured narratives. PMOA-TTS provides a scalable foundation for timeline
extraction, temporal reasoning, and longitudinal modeling in biomedical NLP.

### [8] [Guided by Gut: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Reinforced Intrinsic Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20325)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Keith G. Mills,Baochun Li,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Guided by Gut (GG)的高效自引导测试时间缩放框架，无需依赖昂贵的外部验证模型即可达到PRM级别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间缩放方法（如依赖PRM或BoN）计算成本高，GG旨在通过自引导方式降低成本。

Method: GG利用轻量级树搜索，仅依赖LLM内部信号（如令牌级置信度和步骤新颖性），并通过强化学习微调提高置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，GG使小模型（1.5B参数）达到或超越大模型（32B-70B参数）的精度，同时降低GPU内存使用达10倍，推理速度提升8倍。

Conclusion: GG显著降低了计算和内存成本，为TTS技术的实际部署提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning often incur substantial computational costs, primarily due to
extensive reliance on external Process Reward Models (PRMs) or sampling methods
like Best-of-N (BoN). This paper introduces Guided by Gut (GG), an efficient
self-guided TTS framework that achieves PRM-level performance without costly
external verifier models. Our method employs a lightweight tree search guided
solely by intrinsic LLM signals, token-level confidence and step novelty. One
critical innovation is improving the reliability of internal confidence
estimates via a targeted reinforcement learning fine-tuning phase. Empirical
evaluations on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
GG enables smaller models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) to achieve accuracy matching
or surpassing significantly larger models (e.g., 32B-70B parameters), while
reducing GPU memory usage by up to 10x. Compared to PRM-based methods, GG
achieves comparable accuracy with 8x faster inference speeds and 4-5x lower
memory usage. Additionally, GG reduces KV cache memory usage by approximately
50% compared to the BoN strategy, facilitating more efficient and practical
deployment of TTS techniques.

### [9] [Multi-Scale Manifold Alignment: A Unified Framework for Enhanced Explainability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20333)
*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度流形对齐框架，通过分解潜在空间为全局、中间和局部语义流形，增强LLM的可解释性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）内部推理不透明，限制了其在关键应用中的可解释性和信任度。

Method: 采用多尺度流形对齐框架，结合几何对齐和信息保留约束，并引入曲率正则化和超参数调优。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，对齐误差（KL散度）可被限制，框架能统一解释LLM的多尺度语义结构。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了LLM的可解释性，支持如偏见检测和鲁棒性增强等应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong
performance, yet their internal reasoning remains opaque, limiting
interpretability and trust in critical applications. We propose a novel
Multi_Scale Manifold Alignment framework that decomposes the latent space into
global, intermediate, and local semantic manifolds capturing themes, context,
and word-level details. Our method introduces cross_scale mapping functions
that jointly enforce geometric alignment (e.g., Procrustes analysis) and
information preservation (via mutual information constraints like MINE or VIB).
We further incorporate curvature regularization and hyperparameter tuning for
stable optimization. Theoretical analysis shows that alignment error, measured
by KL divergence, can be bounded under mild assumptions. This framework offers
a unified explanation of how LLMs structure multi-scale semantics, advancing
interpretability and enabling applications such as bias detection and
robustness enhancement.

### [10] [Lookahead Q-Cache: Achieving More Consistent KV Cache Eviction via Pseudo Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20334)
*Yixuan Wang,Shiyu Ji,Yijun Liu,Yuzhuang Xu,Yang Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ)的新框架，通过生成低成本伪前瞻查询来优化KV缓存淘汰，解决了现有方法在内存有限时的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在长文本序列中内存占用大幅增加，现有淘汰方法基于预填充阶段注意力分数，与实际推理查询不一致，尤其在内存紧张时表现不佳。

Method: LAQ框架生成低成本伪前瞻查询，作为重要性估计的观察窗口，以更准确地模拟真实推理场景中的KV缓存淘汰。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，LAQ在有限缓存预算下表现优于现有方法，LongBench上提升1~4分。

Conclusion: LAQ不仅优于现有方法，还能灵活与其他方法结合，进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value cache (KV cache) to accelerate
decoding by reducing redundant computations. However, the KV cache memory usage
grows substantially with longer text sequences, posing challenges for efficient
deployment. Existing KV cache eviction methods prune tokens using
prefilling-stage attention scores, causing inconsistency with actual inference
queries, especially under tight memory budgets. In this paper, we propose
Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), a novel eviction framework that generates low-cost
pseudo lookahead queries to better approximate the true decoding-stage queries.
By using these lookahead queries as the observation window for importance
estimation, LAQ achieves more consistent and accurate KV cache eviction aligned
with real inference scenarios. Experimental results on LongBench and
Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks show that LAQ outperforms existing methods
across various budget levels, achieving a 1 $\sim$ 4 point improvement on
LongBench under limited cache budget. Moreover, LAQ is complementary to
existing approaches and can be flexibly combined to yield further improvements.

### [11] [Language Model Distillation: A Temporal Difference Imitation Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20335)
*Zishun Yu,Shangzhe Li,Xinhua Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时间差分学习的通用框架，通过利用教师模型的分布稀疏性，压缩大型语言模型为更高效的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大，但计算成本高昂，蒸馏成为压缩模型的有效方法。现有方法多从模仿学习或逆强化学习角度出发，本文从时间差分学习角度提出新框架。

Method: 利用语言模型概率分布稀疏的特性，设计了一个在缩减动作空间（词汇子集）上操作的时间差分学习框架，并推导出实用算法。

Result: 展示了该框架的性能提升，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的时间差分蒸馏框架为语言模型压缩提供了新思路，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks,
although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs.
Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly
capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model
distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of
imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has
inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning
techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference
learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal
difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal
difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the
teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign
most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this
observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates
on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how
practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.

### [12] [MOSLIM:Align with diverse preferences in prompts through reward classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20336)
*Yu Zhang,Wanli Jiang,Zhengyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSLIM是一种新颖的多目标对齐方法，通过单一奖励模型和策略模型解决多样化目标，无需在SFT阶段进行偏好训练，显著减少GPU资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保基础模型符合多样化人类偏好，当前方法通常需要多个策略或奖励模型，或训练特定偏好的SFT模型。

Method: MOSLIM利用多头部奖励模型对问答对进行分类，并通过映射函数将分类结果转化为奖励分数，优化策略模型。

Result: 在多个多目标基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有方法，且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: MOSLIM提供了一种高效、灵活的多目标对齐解决方案，适用于大规模模型部署。

Abstract: The multi-objective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential
for ensuring foundational models conform to diverse human preferences. Current
research in this field typically involves either multiple policies or multiple
reward models customized for various preferences, or the need to train a
preference-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model. In this work, we
introduce a novel multi-objective alignment method, MOSLIM, which utilizes a
single reward model and policy model to address diverse objectives. MOSLIM
provides a flexible way to control these objectives through prompting and does
not require preference training during SFT phase, allowing thousands of
off-the-shelf models to be directly utilized within this training framework.
MOSLIM leverages a multi-head reward model that classifies question-answer
pairs instead of scoring them and then optimize policy model with a scalar
reward derived from a mapping function that converts classification results
from reward model into reward scores. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed method across several multi-objective benchmarks and conduct ablation
studies on various reward model sizes and policy optimization methods. The
MOSLIM method outperforms current multi-objective approaches in most results
while requiring significantly fewer GPU computing resources compared with
existing policy optimization methods.

### [13] [Assessing the Capability of LLMs in Solving POSCOMP Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20338)
*Cayo Viegas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在计算机科学专业领域考试（POSCOMP）中的表现，发现ChatGPT-4等模型在文本任务上表现优异，甚至超越人类考生，但图像解释仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在计算机科学等专业领域的实际能力，评估其应用潜力并指导未来发展。

Method: 评估四种LLMs（ChatGPT-4、Gemini 1.0 Advanced等）在2022-2023年POSCOMP考试中的表现，并扩展到2024年考试及更新模型。

Result: ChatGPT-4在2023年考试中表现最佳，超越所有人类考生；新模型在2022-2024年考试中持续优于人类平均水平。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是ChatGPT-4）在文本任务上表现出色，但需改进图像解释能力；新模型进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence in natural language
processing tasks. Despite this progress, their performance in specialized
domains such as computer science remains relatively unexplored. Understanding
the proficiency of LLMs in these domains is critical for evaluating their
practical utility and guiding future developments. The POSCOMP, a prestigious
Brazilian examination used for graduate admissions in computer science promoted
by the Brazlian Computer Society (SBC), provides a challenging benchmark. This
study investigates whether LLMs can match or surpass human performance on the
POSCOMP exam. Four LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.0 Advanced, Claude 3 Sonnet, and
Le Chat Mistral Large - were initially evaluated on the 2022 and 2023 POSCOMP
exams. The assessments measured the models' proficiency in handling complex
questions typical of the exam. LLM performance was notably better on text-based
questions than on image interpretation tasks. In the 2022 exam, ChatGPT-4 led
with 57 correct answers out of 69 questions, followed by Gemini 1.0 Advanced
(49), Le Chat Mistral (48), and Claude 3 Sonnet (44). Similar trends were
observed in the 2023 exam. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest performance,
surpassing all students who took the POSCOMP 2023 exam. LLMs, particularly
ChatGPT-4, show promise in text-based tasks on the POSCOMP exam, although image
interpretation remains a challenge. Given the rapid evolution of LLMs, we
expanded our analysis to include more recent models - o1, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and o3-mini-high - evaluated on the 2022-2024 POSCOMP exams.
These newer models demonstrate further improvements and consistently surpass
both the average and top-performing human participants across all three years.

*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMET提出了一种动态流形演化理论，将大语言模型生成建模为低维语义流形上的受控动态系统，通过量化指标评估生成文本的流畅性、语法性和语义连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是提供一个统一的框架，将语言模型生成过程建模为动态系统，从而更好地理解和优化生成文本的质量。

Method: 方法包括将潜在状态更新建模为连续动力学的离散时间欧拉近似，并将能量驱动流和上下文相关力映射到Transformer组件上。

Result: 实验验证了DMET的预测，并提供了平衡文本生成中创造性和一致性的原则性指导。

Conclusion: 结论表明DMET能够有效量化生成文本的质量，并为优化生成过程提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Manifold Evolution Theory (DMET),a unified framework
that models large language model generation as a controlled dynamical system
evolving on a low_dimensional semantic manifold. By casting latent_state
updates as discrete time Euler approximations of continuous dynamics, we map
intrinsic energy_driven flows and context_dependent forces onto Transformer
components (residual connections, attention, feed-forward networks). Leveraging
Lyapunov stability theory We define three empirical metrics (state continuity,
clustering quality, topological persistence) that quantitatively link
latent_trajectory properties to text fluency, grammaticality, and semantic
coherence. Extensive experiments across decoding parameters validate DMET's
predictions and yield principled guidelines for balancing creativity and
consistency in text generation.

### [15] [Do LLMs have a Gender (Entropy) Bias?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20343)
*Sonal Prabhune,Balaji Padmanabhan,Kaushik Dutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现流行LLMs中存在性别偏见，提出新基准数据集RealWorldQuestioning，定义并研究熵偏见，发现类别层面无显著偏见，但个体问题层面差异显著。提出简单去偏见方法，效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中性别偏见的存在和持续性，特别是在商业和健康领域的现实问题中。

Method: 使用四种LLMs测试，结合ChatGPT-4o评估，提出迭代合并性别响应的去偏见方法。

Result: 类别层面无显著偏见，个体问题层面差异显著；去偏见方法在78%情况下提高信息量。

Conclusion: 简单提示策略可有效去偏见，建议进一步优化以改善LLMs的公平性。

Abstract: We investigate the existence and persistence of a specific type of gender
bias in some of the popular LLMs and contribute a new benchmark dataset,
RealWorldQuestioning (released on HuggingFace ), developed from real-world
questions across four key domains in business and health contexts: education,
jobs, personal financial management, and general health. We define and study
entropy bias, which we define as a discrepancy in the amount of information
generated by an LLM in response to real questions users have asked. We tested
this using four different LLMs and evaluated the generated responses both
qualitatively and quantitatively by using ChatGPT-4o (as "LLM-as-judge"). Our
analyses (metric-based comparisons and "LLM-as-judge" evaluation) suggest that
there is no significant bias in LLM responses for men and women at a category
level. However, at a finer granularity (the individual question level), there
are substantial differences in LLM responses for men and women in the majority
of cases, which "cancel" each other out often due to some responses being
better for males and vice versa. This is still a concern since typical users of
these tools often ask a specific question (only) as opposed to several varied
ones in each of these common yet important areas of life. We suggest a simple
debiasing approach that iteratively merges the responses for the two genders to
produce a final result. Our approach demonstrates that a simple, prompt-based
debiasing strategy can effectively debias LLM outputs, thus producing responses
with higher information content than both gendered variants in 78% of the
cases, and consistently achieving a balanced integration in the remaining
cases.

### [16] [SeRL: Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20347)
*Wenkai Fang,Shunyu Liu,Yang Zhou,Kongcheng Zhang,Tongya Zheng,Kaixuan Chen,Mingli Song,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeRL是一种通过自生成指令和自奖励机制来增强LLM训练的方法，解决了高质量指令和可验证奖励难以获取的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量指令和可验证奖励，但在专业领域中难以获取，因此需要一种自给自足的训练方法。

Method: SeRL包含自指令和自奖励两个模块，前者生成多样化指令，后者通过多数投票机制估计奖励，无需外部标注。

Result: 实验表明，SeRL在多种推理任务和LLM骨干上表现优于现有方法，性能接近依赖高质量数据的方法。

Conclusion: SeRL通过自生成数据和迭代学习，有效解决了数据稀缺问题，提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing works inevitably rely on high-quality instructions and
verifiable rewards for effective training, both of which are often difficult to
obtain in specialized domains. In this paper, we propose Self-play
Reinforcement Learning(SeRL) to bootstrap LLM training with limited initial
data. Specifically, SeRL comprises two complementary modules: self-instruction
and self-rewarding. The former module generates additional instructions based
on the available data at each training step, employing robust online filtering
strategies to ensure instruction quality, diversity, and difficulty. The latter
module introduces a simple yet effective majority-voting mechanism to estimate
response rewards for additional instructions, eliminating the need for external
annotations. Finally, SeRL performs conventional RL based on the generated
data, facilitating iterative self-play learning. Extensive experiments on
various reasoning benchmarks and across different LLM backbones demonstrate
that the proposed SeRL yields results superior to its counterparts and achieves
performance on par with those obtained by high-quality data with verifiable
rewards. Our code is available at https://github.com/wantbook-book/SeRL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强的方法，用于蛋白质-文本生成，解决了现有基准中的数据泄漏问题，并引入了新的生物实体评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质-文本模型在评估中存在数据泄漏问题，且传统自然语言处理指标不适用于该领域。

Method: 通过重组数据集并引入基于生物实体的评估框架，提出了一种检索增强的方法。

Result: 该方法在蛋白质-文本生成中显著优于微调的大型语言模型，并在无需训练的场景下表现出高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 研究为蛋白质-文本理解提供了更可靠的评估方法和高效的生成技术。

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for
their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches
focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models
through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous
comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough
analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding
benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current
benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language
processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To
address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a
novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our
observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly
outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy
and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at

### [18] [Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415)
*Xingwei Tan,Marco Valentino,Mahmud Akhter,Maria Liakata,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过生成符号推理轨迹并结合蒙特卡洛估计优化的过程奖励模型来提升大语言模型（LLMs）的逻辑推理和泛化能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现良好，但其性能可能源于记忆而非泛化能力，且对内容变化敏感。现有方法未能有效利用符号表示，因此需要一种更可靠的验证机制。

Method: 生成符号推理轨迹，通过蒙特卡洛估计优化的过程奖励模型筛选高质量轨迹，并用于微调LLMs以提升推理能力。

Result: 在FOLIO和LogicAsker等逻辑推理基准测试中取得显著提升，且实验表明符号推理轨迹能增强跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 符号引导的过程监督有望减轻记忆效应对LLM推理的影响，提升其可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical
and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to
memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such
performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations,
demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning
process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs
with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively
leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing
reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to
overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and
select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned
based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via
fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our
results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the
effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and
open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification
reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories
enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of
symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of
memorization on LLM reasoning.

### [19] [GraphGen: Enhancing Supervised Fine-Tuning for LLMs with Knowledge-Driven Synthetic Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20416)
*Zihong Chen,Wanli Jiang,Jinzhe Li,Zhonghang Yuan,Huanjun Kong,Wanli Ouyang,Nanqing Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphGen是一种基于知识图谱的框架，用于生成高质量的问答对，以解决大语言模型微调中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型微调需要大量高质量监督数据，但获取成本高且耗时。现有合成数据方法存在事实不准确、覆盖不足等问题。

Method: GraphGen通过构建细粒度知识图谱，识别模型知识缺口，并采用多跳邻域采样和风格控制生成多样化的问答对。

Result: 实验表明，GraphGen在知识密集型任务中优于传统合成数据方法。

Conclusion: GraphGen为监督微调中的数据稀缺问题提供了更可靠和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) typically requires substantial
amounts of high-quality supervised data, which is both costly and
labor-intensive to acquire. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a
promising solution, existing approaches frequently suffer from factual
inaccuracies, insufficient long-tail coverage, simplistic knowledge structures,
and homogenized outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphGen, a
knowledge graph-guided framework designed for three key question-answering (QA)
scenarios: atomic QA, aggregated QA, and multi-hop QA. It begins by
constructing a fine-grained knowledge graph from the source text. It then
identifies knowledge gaps in LLMs using the expected calibration error metric,
prioritizing the generation of QA pairs that target high-value, long-tail
knowledge. Furthermore, GraphGen incorporates multi-hop neighborhood sampling
to capture complex relational information and employs style-controlled
generation to diversify the resulting QA data. Experimental results on
knowledge-intensive tasks under closed-book settings demonstrate that GraphGen
outperforms conventional synthetic data methods, offering a more reliable and
comprehensive solution to the data scarcity challenge in supervised
fine-tuning. The code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/open-sciencelab/GraphGen.

*Arvindh Arun,Sumit Kumar,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Bo Xiong,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Antonio Vergari,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEMMA是一种双模块知识图谱基础模型，通过结合文本语义和结构信息，显著提升了零样本推理能力，尤其在未见关系词汇的挑战性场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱基础模型（KGFMs）仅依赖图结构，忽略了文本属性中的丰富语义信号，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: SEMMA利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成语义嵌入，构建文本关系图，并将其与结构模块融合。

Result: 在54个多样化知识图谱上，SEMMA在完全归纳链接预测中优于纯结构基线（如ULTRA），在未见关系词汇场景中效果是结构方法的2倍。

Conclusion: 文本语义在结构方法失效的场景中至关重要，表明基础模型需统一结构和语言信号以实现更好的知识推理。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling
zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns.
However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the
rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a
dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics
alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich
relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a
textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54
diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully
inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging
generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely
unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our
findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in
settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation
models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: PreP-OCR是一个两阶段流程，结合图像修复和语义感知的OCR后校正，显著提升历史文档的文本提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文档因退化导致的OCR提取错误问题，通过联合优化图像清晰度和语言一致性。

Method: 1. 生成合成图像对训练图像修复模型；2. 使用ByT5模型进行OCR后校正。

Result: 在13,831页历史文档上测试，字符错误率降低63.9-70.3%。

Conclusion: PreP-OCR展示了图像修复与语言校正结合在历史档案数字化中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces PreP-OCR, a two-stage pipeline that combines document
image restoration with semantic-aware post-OCR correction to improve text
extraction from degraded historical documents. Our key innovation lies in
jointly optimizing image clarity and linguistic consistency. First, we generate
synthetic image pairs with randomized text fonts, layouts, and degradations. An
image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using
multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second,
a ByT5 post-corrector, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text training pairs,
addresses any remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of
real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that PreP-OCR
pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3\% compared to OCR on raw
images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image
restoration with linguistic error correction for digitizing historical
archives.

### [23] [HAMburger: Accelerating LLM Inference via Token Smashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20438)
*Jingyu Liu,Ce Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAMburger是一种分层自回归模型，通过优化KV缓存和计算资源分配，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理中每个令牌需要一次前向传递和一次KV缓存，效率较低。研究发现LLM能够自我识别KV缓存的信息量，许多令牌无需全局上下文即可生成。

Method: 引入HAMburger模型，结合组合嵌入器和微步解码器，将多个令牌压缩为单个KV缓存，并实现每步生成多个令牌。

Result: KV缓存计算减少2倍，吞吐量提升2倍，同时在短长上下文任务中保持质量。

Conclusion: HAMburger探索了一种计算和内存高效的推理方案，硬件无关设计极具挑战性。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference
requires a holistic optimization on algorithms, systems, and hardware. However,
very few works have fundamentally changed the generation pattern: each token
needs one forward pass and one KV cache. This can be sub-optimal because we
found that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of
information that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated
confidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce
HAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource
allocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token
during inference. Stacking a compositional embedder and a micro-step decoder in
between a base LLM, HAMburger smashes multiple tokens into a single KV and
generates several tokens per step. Additionally, HAMburger functions as a
speculative decoding framework where it can blindly trust self-drafted tokens.
As a result, HAMburger shifts the growth of KV cache and forward FLOPs from
linear to sub-linear with respect to output length, and adjusts its inference
speed based on query perplexity and output structure. Extensive evaluations
show that HAMburger reduces the KV cache computation by up to 2$\times$ and
achieves up to 2$\times$ TPS, while maintaining quality in both short- and
long-context tasks. Our method explores an extremely challenging inference
regime that requires both computation- and memory-efficiency with a
hardware-agnostic design.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过上下文学习（ICL），大型语言模型（LLMs）可以在无监督数据的情况下学习低资源语言，并在语音识别任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球约有7000种语言，但当前LLMs仅支持少数语言。研究旨在探索LLMs是否可以通过ICL学习未见过的低资源语言。

Method: 在四种未训练过的濒危语言上进行实验，比较基于概率和基于指令的方法，并评估ICL对语言建模和语音识别任务的影响。

Result: 提供更多相关文本样本可提升性能，基于概率的方法优于传统方法，ICL使LLMs在语音识别任务中表现接近或超越专用模型。

Conclusion: ICL是一种有效的方法，使LLMs能够学习低资源语言，同时保持其原有能力。

Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language
models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can
learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this
investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn
unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With
experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been
trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances
performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the
traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show
ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even
surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages,
while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amulet框架通过对话行为和准则提升LLM评委在多轮复杂对话中的评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）被广泛用作评委评估其他模型的响应，但现有方法在复杂多轮对话中表现不足，需改进。

Method: Amulet利用对话行为和准则分析对话结构和意图，并评估响应是否满足对话准则。

Result: 在四个数据集中，Amulet显示人类意图频繁变化（60-70%），75%的偏好响应可通过对话行为或准则区分。

Conclusion: Amulet显著提升了LLM评委的评估性能，可作为独立评委或集成到评委组中使用。

Abstract: Today, large language models are widely used as judges to evaluate responses
from other language models. Hence, it is imperative to benchmark and improve
these LLM-judges on real-world language model usage: a typical human-assistant
conversation is lengthy, and shows significant diversity in topics, intents,
and requirements across turns, e.g. social interactions, task requests,
feedback. We present Amulet, a framework that leverages pertinent linguistic
concepts of dialog-acts and maxims to improve the accuracy of LLM-judges on
preference data with complex, multi-turn conversational context. Amulet
presents valuable insights about (a) the communicative structures and intents
present in the conversation (dialog acts), and (b) the satisfaction of
conversational principles (maxims) by the preference responses, and uses them
to make judgments. On four challenging datasets, Amulet shows that (a) humans
frequently (60 to 70 percent of the time) change their intents from one turn of
the conversation to the next, and (b) in 75 percent of instances, the
preference responses can be differentiated via dialog acts and/or maxims,
reiterating the latter's significance in judging such data. Amulet can be used
either as a judge by applying the framework to a single LLM, or integrated into
a jury with different LLM judges; our judges and juries show strong
improvements on relevant baselines for all four datasets.

*Vibhor Agarwal,Arjoo Gupta,Suparna De,Nishanth Sastry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用机制（Conversation Kernels）来分析在线对话中的上下文依赖关系，以理解帖子的不同属性（如信息性、趣味性等）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交网络和在线讨论论坛的发展，理解在线对话的需求增加。但由于帖子简短且隐含上下文依赖，传统方法难以捕捉对话的复杂性。

Method: 设计了两种Conversation Kernels，通过探索对话树中帖子的邻域来构建相关上下文，适用于不同任务。

Result: 在slashdot.org的对话数据上验证了方法的通用性和灵活性，能够适应多种对话理解任务。

Conclusion: Conversation Kernels是一种通用且灵活的框架，能够有效捕捉在线对话的上下文依赖关系。

Abstract: Understanding online conversations has attracted research attention with the
growth of social networks and online discussion forums. Content analysis of
posts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual
utterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the
same conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the
conversational context and dependencies between different parts of a
conversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and
comments/replies into the language model.
  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate
conversational context for various aspects about an online post in a
conversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or
funny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which
explore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing
the conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that
is appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to
conversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly
different labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore
provides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as
Conversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to
disparately different conversation understanding tasks.

*Roi Cohen,Russa Biswas,Gerard de Melo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种信息对齐机制，旨在提升模型生成既正确又详细的事实性文本的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs生成的事实性文本可能是正确的，但它们往往选择生成信息量较少的内容。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种信息对齐机制，利用现有的事实性基准来设计一个优先选择正确且详细答案的目标。

Result: 研究发现，通过优化这一目标，不仅可以提升信息量，还能改善事实性。

Conclusion: 信息对齐机制是一种有效的方法，可以同时提升模型生成文本的信息量和事实性。

Abstract: Factual completeness is a general term that captures how detailed and
informative a factually correct text is. For instance, the factual sentence
``Barack Obama was born in the United States'' is factually correct, though
less informative than the factual sentence ``Barack Obama was born in Honolulu,
Hawaii, United States''. Despite the known fact that LLMs tend to hallucinate
and generate factually incorrect text, they might also tend to choose to
generate factual text that is indeed factually correct and yet less informative
than other, more informative choices. In this work, we tackle this problem by
proposing an informativeness alignment mechanism. This mechanism takes
advantage of recent factual benchmarks to propose an informativeness alignment
objective. This objective prioritizes answers that are both correct and
informative. A key finding of our work is that when training a model to
maximize this objective or optimize its preference, we can improve not just
informativeness but also factuality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Inceptive Transformer的轻量级模块化架构，通过多尺度特征提取模块增强基于Transformer的表示，动态权衡局部和全局依赖关系，在多个任务中表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer模型将所有令牌信息压缩到单个[CLS]令牌中，可能导致信息丢失，尤其是在需要局部或层次化提示的任务中。

Method: 引入Inceptive Transformer，结合多尺度特征提取模块，动态加权令牌以平衡局部和全局依赖关系。

Result: 在情感识别、反讽检测、疾病识别和反疫苗推文分类等任务中，模型性能比基线提升1%至14%，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在多领域和跨语言任务中增强Transformer表示的通用性和适用性。

Abstract: Conventional transformer models typically compress the information from all
tokens in a sequence into a single \texttt{[CLS]} token to represent global
context-- an approach that can lead to information loss in tasks requiring
localized or hierarchical cues. In this work, we introduce \textit{Inceptive
Transformer}, a modular and lightweight architecture that enriches
transformer-based token representations by integrating a multi-scale feature
extraction module inspired by inception networks. Our model is designed to
balance local and global dependencies by dynamically weighting tokens based on
their relevance to a particular task. Evaluation across a diverse range of
tasks including emotion recognition (both English and Bangla), irony detection,
disease identification, and anti-COVID vaccine tweets classification shows that
our models consistently outperform the baselines by 1\% to 14\% while
maintaining efficiency. These findings highlight the versatility and
cross-lingual applicability of our method for enriching transformer-based
representations across diverse domains.

like r\'esum\'e screening and content moderation, giving them the power to
amplify or suppress certain perspectives. While previous research has
identified disability-related biases in LLMs, little is known about how they
conceptualize ableism or detect it in text. We evaluate the ability of four
LLMs to identify nuanced ableism directed at autistic individuals. We examine
the gap between their understanding of relevant terminology and their
effectiveness in recognizing ableist content in context. Our results reveal
that LLMs can identify autism-related language but often miss harmful or
offensive connotations. Further, we conduct a qualitative comparison of human
and LLM explanations. We find that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level keyword
matching, leading to context misinterpretations, in contrast to human
annotators who consider context, speaker identity, and potential impact. On the
other hand, both LLMs and humans agree on the annotation scheme, suggesting
that a binary classification is adequate for evaluating LLM performance, which
is consistent with findings from prior studies involving human annotators.

*Rohan Balasubramanian,Nitish Gokulakrishnan,Syeda Jannatus Saba,Steven Skiena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了现代大语言模型（LLMs）将《了不起的盖茨比》转化为无'e'文本的能力，展示了英语在严格约束下的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在严格约束（如无'e'文本）下的表现，揭示语言的适应性和创造性。

Method: 采用多种技术，从基础的同义词替换到复杂的生成模型（如束搜索和命名实体分析）。

Result: 排除高达3.6%的常见字母（如'u'）对文本意义影响较小，但更强的约束会显著降低翻译保真度。

Conclusion: 英语在严格约束下表现出惊人的灵活性，语言具有高度的适应性和创造力。

Abstract: Lipograms are a unique form of constrained writing where all occurrences of a
particular letter are excluded from the text, typified by the novel Gadsby,
which daringly avoids all usage of the letter 'e'. In this study, we explore
the power of modern large language models (LLMs) by transforming the novel F.
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby into a fully 'e'-less text. We experimented
with a range of techniques, from baseline methods like synonym replacement to
sophisticated generative models enhanced with beam search and named entity
analysis. We show that excluding up to 3.6% of the most common letters (up to
the letter 'u') had minimal impact on the text's meaning, although translation
fidelity rapidly and predictably decays with stronger lipogram constraints. Our
work highlights the surprising flexibility of English under strict constraints,
revealing just how adaptable and creative language can be.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ITAB基准测试评估开源LLM在生成功能性Ansible脚本时的表现，发现其在状态推理和模块知识方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在IT自动化任务（如Ansible）中的实际表现，填补现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 提出ITAB基准测试，包含126个多样化任务，动态评估14个开源LLM生成Ansible脚本的能力。

Result: 开源LLM在pass@10中的成功率低于12%，主要错误为状态推理（44.87%）和模块知识（24.37%）问题。

Conclusion: LLM在IT自动化中的可靠性需在状态推理和领域知识方面取得重大进展。

Abstract: LLMs show promise in code generation, yet their effectiveness for IT
automation tasks, particularly for tools like Ansible, remains understudied.
Existing benchmarks rely primarily on synthetic tasks that fail to capture the
needs of practitioners who use IT automation tools, such as Ansible. We present
ITAB (IT Automation Task Benchmark), a benchmark of 126 diverse tasks (e.g.,
configuring servers, managing files) where each task accounts for state
reconciliation: a property unique to IT automation tools. ITAB evaluates LLMs'
ability to generate functional Ansible automation scripts via dynamic execution
in controlled environments. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs, none of which
accomplish pass@10 at a rate beyond 12%. To explain these low scores, we
analyze 1,411 execution failures across the evaluated LLMs and identify two
main categories of prevalent semantic errors: failures in state reconciliation
related reasoning (44.87% combined from variable (11.43%), host (11.84%),
path(11.63%), and template (9.97%) issues) and deficiencies in module-specific
execution knowledge (24.37% combined from Attribute and parameter (14.44%) and
module (9.93%) errors). Our findings reveal key limitations in open-source
LLMs' ability to track state changes and apply specialized module knowledge,
indicating that reliable IT automation will require major advances in state
reasoning and domain-specific execution understanding.

Method: 引入AstroVisBench，结合科学计算和可视化任务，并采用LLM-as-a-judge的工作流进行验证。

Result: 当前最先进的语言模型在天文学研究中作为助手的实用性存在显著差距。

Conclusion: AstroVisBench为AI科学家提供了一个端到端的评估工具，推动了可视化工作流的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in
scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature,
answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct
computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists
derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often
arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However,
evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs
conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has
not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first
benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy
domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create
astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the
results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of
visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against
annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an
evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in
their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This
evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that
offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows,
which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.

Motivation: 研究多语言LLMs在事实召回任务中表现不一致的原因，并提出改进方法以提高多语言能力。

Method: 使用机制分析技术揭示LLMs的处理流程，发现其依赖英语机制和翻译过程。提出两种语言无关的向量干预方法，优化内部路径以提高事实一致性。

Result: 干预方法使最低性能语言的事实召回准确率提高了35%以上。

Conclusion: 机制分析可揭示LLMs的潜在多语言能力，通过针对性干预显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit factual
inconsistencies across languages, with significantly better performance in
factual recall tasks in English than in other languages. The causes of these
failures, however, remain poorly understood. Using mechanistic analysis
techniques, we uncover the underlying pipeline that LLMs employ, which involves
using the English-centric factual recall mechanism to process multilingual
queries and then translating English answers back into the target language. We
identify two primary sources of error: insufficient engagement of the reliable
English-centric mechanism for factual recall, and incorrect translation from
English back into the target language for the final answer. To address these
vulnerabilities, we introduce two vector interventions, both independent of
languages and datasets, to redirect the model toward better internal paths for
higher factual consistency. Our interventions combined increase the recall
accuracy by over 35 percent for the lowest-performing language. Our findings
demonstrate how mechanistic insights can be used to unlock latent multilingual
capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: NaijaVoices数据集填补了非洲语言（如伊博语、豪萨语和约鲁巴语）在语音技术中的空白，提供了1800小时的语音文本数据，显著提升了语音识别模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在语音技术中代表性不足，现有数据集规模小且多样性不足，限制了语音技术的普及。

Method: 通过独特的数据收集方法构建了包含5000多名说话者的NaijaVoices数据集，并分析了其声学多样性。

Result: 在自动语音识别实验中，数据集显著降低了Whisper、MMS和XLSR模型的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: NaijaVoices数据集为非洲语言的语音处理提供了重要资源，推动了多语言技术的发展。

Abstract: The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies
depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages --
including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to
insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the
2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people.
While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the
scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+
speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic
diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on
automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06%
(MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices'
potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将反馈翻译为其他语言会导致语义和上下文丢失，因此需要一种直接处理西班牙语的方法。

Method: 采用TF-IDF与BERT嵌入结合的混合方法，并使用自定义堆叠集成（CSE）模型，结合多种分类器。

Result: CSE模型在西班牙语数据集上测试准确率达93.3%，优于单独模型和BERT模型。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF和BERT的方法能有效提升西班牙语情感分类的准确性，为业务反馈分析提供支持。

Abstract: Classifying customer feedback into distinct emotion categories is essential
for understanding sentiment and improving customer experience. In this paper,
we classify customer feedback in Spanish into three emotion
categories--positive, neutral, and negative--using advanced NLP and ML
techniques. Traditional methods translate feedback from widely spoken languages
to less common ones, resulting in a loss of semantic integrity and contextual
nuances inherent to the original language. To address this limitation, we
propose a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF with BERT embeddings,
effectively transforming Spanish text into rich numerical representations that
preserve the semantic depth of the original language by using a Custom Stacking
Ensemble (CSE) approach. To evaluate emotion classification, we utilize a range
of models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Bagging classifier with LGBM,
and AdaBoost. The CSE model combines these classifiers as base models and uses
a one-vs-all Logistic Regression as the meta-model. Our experimental results
demonstrate that CSE significantly outperforms the individual and BERT model,
achieving a test accuracy of 93.3% on the native Spanish dataset--higher than
the accuracy obtained from the translated version. These findings underscore
the challenges of emotion classification in Spanish and highlight the
advantages of combining vectorization techniques like TF-IDF with BERT for
improved accuracy. Our results provide valuable insights for businesses seeking
to leverage emotion classification to enhance customer feedback analysis and
service improvements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对生产场景的高精度、高性能NL2SQL系统优化框架，通过静态示例集和多目标优化提升SQL生成质量与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NL2SQL方法注重SQL生成质量，但生产场景需要高精度和高性能，需解决示例选择与性能优化的挑战。

Method: 提出基于多目标优化的提示优化框架，选择静态示例集以捕捉查询日志、数据库、SQL结构和执行延迟的复杂性。

Result: 初步实证分析表明该框架有效。

Conclusion: 该框架为生产场景提供了高精度、高性能的NL2SQL解决方案。

Abstract: NL2SQL approaches have greatly benefited from the impressive capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for
a specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient
contextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.
However, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of
selecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant
schema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM
understand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the
go-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods
introduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.
  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,
high-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL
generation, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such
scenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the
intricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution
latencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on
similarity. The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative
set of exemplars for a given production setting. To this end, we propose a
prompt optimization framework that not only addresses the high-precision
requirement but also optimizes the performance of the generated SQL through
multi-objective optimization. Preliminary empirical analysis demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练数据中语言和声学多样性对ASR模型鲁棒性的影响，以解决大规模数据集不切实际的问题。

Method: 分析声学变化对转录泛化的作用，并测试基于960小时Librispeech数据集的声学增强方法。

Result: 声学增强方法在未见数据集上可将词错误率降低高达19.24%。

Conclusion: 声学聚焦的数据增强是构建鲁棒ASR模型的有效替代方案，尤其适用于缺乏大规模语音数据的情况。

Abstract: Whisper's robust performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is often
attributed to its massive 680k-hour training set, an impractical scale for most
researchers. In this work, we examine how linguistic and acoustic diversity in
training data affect the robustness of the ASR model and reveal that
transcription generalization is primarily driven by acoustic variation rather
than linguistic richness. We find that targeted acoustic augmentation methods
could significantly improve the generalization ability of ASR models, reducing
word-error rates by up to 19.24 percent on unseen datasets when training on the
960-hour Librispeech dataset. These findings highlight strategic acoustically
focused data augmentation as a promising alternative to massive datasets for
building robust ASR models, offering a potential solution to future foundation
ASR models when massive human speech data is lacking.

Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school

mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise
theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our
fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a
retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving
college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed
HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math
problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive
environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our
experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive
results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we
introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our
prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统强化学习方法（如PPO和DPO）在单步任务中的局限性，适应多步SiMT任务的需求。

Method: 采用顺序决策框架，结合定制奖励，优化SiMT过程。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，翻译质量显著提升且延迟降低，甚至媲美离线翻译模型。

Conclusion: SeqPO-SiMT在多步SiMT任务中表现出色，为同步翻译提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Sequential Policy Optimization for Simultaneous Machine
Translation (SeqPO-SiMT), a new policy optimization framework that defines the
simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) task as a sequential decision making
problem, incorporating a tailored reward to enhance translation quality while
reducing latency. In contrast to popular Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) methods, such as PPO and DPO, which are typically applied in
single-step tasks, SeqPO-SiMT effectively tackles the multi-step SiMT task.
This intuitive framework allows the SiMT LLMs to simulate and refine the SiMT
process using a tailored reward. We conduct experiments on six datasets from
diverse domains for En to Zh and Zh to En SiMT tasks, demonstrating that
SeqPO-SiMT consistently achieves significantly higher translation quality with
lower latency. In particular, SeqPO-SiMT outperforms the supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) model by 1.13 points in COMET, while reducing the Average Lagging by 6.17
in the NEWSTEST2021 En to Zh dataset. While SiMT operates with far less context
than offline translation, the SiMT results of SeqPO-SiMT on 7B LLM surprisingly
rival the offline translation of high-performing LLMs, including
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Conclusion: 极化具有高度情境性，需要更稳健、适应性强的NLP方法，POLAR数据集将公开以支持全球研究。

Abstract: Online polarization poses a growing challenge for democratic discourse, yet
most computational social science research remains monolingual, culturally
narrow, or event-specific. We introduce POLAR, a multilingual, multicultural,
and multievent dataset with over 23k instances in seven languages from diverse
online platforms and real-world events. Polarization is annotated along three
axes: presence, type, and manifestation, using a variety of annotation
platforms adapted to each cultural context. We conduct two main experiments:
(1) we fine-tune six multilingual pretrained language models in both
monolingual and cross-lingual setups; and (2) we evaluate a range of open and
closed large language models (LLMs) in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.
Results show that while most models perform well on binary polarization
detection, they achieve substantially lower scores when predicting polarization
types and manifestations. These findings highlight the complex, highly
contextual nature of polarization and the need for robust, adaptable approaches
in NLP and computational social science. All resources will be released to
support further research and effective mitigation of digital polarization
globally.

Result: 在1k至1M长度的基准测试中，XpandA实现了20%的性能提升和1.5倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: XpandA为长上下文处理提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了LLM的能力。

Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large
language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer
methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial
limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified
information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of
inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with
question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context
processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning
of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows
for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to
update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,
constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)
selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of
question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order
structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive
evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying
from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long
sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context
capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference
speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.

Conclusion: TLM通过测试时学习有效提升了LLMs在专业领域的适应能力，同时避免了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable emergent
capabilities through extensive pre-training, they still face critical
limitations in generalizing to specialized domains and handling diverse
linguistic variations, known as distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose
a Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically
adapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing.
Specifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to
reveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing
the input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we
formulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity
minimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance.
Furthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more
informative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample
Efficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these
high-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
instead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates
while preserving more original knowledge from the model. We introduce the
AdaptEval benchmark for TTL and demonstrate through experiments that TLM
improves performance by at least 20% compared to original LLMs on domain
knowledge adaptation.

*Kai Chen,Zihao He,Taiwei Shi,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Steer-Bench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同社区规范下适应能力的基准测试，覆盖30个对比子论坛，测试结果显示模型表现与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在适应多样化社区规范和视角方面的能力，目前这一能力尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 方法是通过Steer-Bench基准测试，使用30对对比子论坛的数据（10,000+指令-响应对和5,500+多选题）评估13种流行LLMs的表现。

Result: 结果显示，人类专家准确率为81%，而表现最佳的LLMs仅达到约65%，部分模型与人类水平差距超过15个百分点。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs在社区敏感性和适应性方面存在显著不足，Steer-Bench为系统评估这些能力提供了工具。

Abstract: Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs
to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication
styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We
introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering
using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs
across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs
and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels
to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular
LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of
81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65%
accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind
human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant
gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to
systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific
instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their
ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

*Yan Wang,Yang Ren,Lingfei Qian,Xueqing Peng,Keyi Wang,Yi Han,Dongji Feng,Xiao-Yang Liu,Jimin Huang,Qianqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinTagging是首个全范围、表格感知的XBRL基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在XBRL财务报告中的结构化信息提取和语义对齐能力。它将XBRL标记问题分解为两个子任务：FinNI（金融实体提取）和FinCL（分类驱动的概念对齐），并在零样本设置下评估多种LLM的性能。结果表明，LLM在信息提取方面表现良好，但在细粒度概念对齐方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准将XBRL标记简化为扁平的多类分类，仅关注叙述性文本，无法全面评估LLM在财务报告中的实际能力。FinTagging旨在填补这一空白，提供更真实、细粒度的评估框架。

Method: FinTagging将XBRL标记分解为FinNI（金融实体提取）和FinCL（概念对齐）两个子任务，要求模型在非结构化文本和结构化表格中联合提取事实并与10k+ US-GAAP分类对齐。

Result: LLM在信息提取方面表现出色，但在细粒度概念对齐（尤其是区分密切相关的分类条目）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: FinTagging揭示了现有LLM在完全自动化XBRL标记方面的局限性，强调了改进语义推理和模式感知建模的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce FinTagging, the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark
designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic
alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of
XBRL-based financial reporting. Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL
tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text,
FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for
financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It
requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+
US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling
realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under
zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks
and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate
strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with
fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related
taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in
fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic
reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial
disclosure. Code is available at our GitHub repository and data is at our
Hugging Face repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于事件的新型标注方法，构建了首个中文网络欺凌事件检测数据集CHNCI，包含91个事件的220,676条评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络欺凌检测基准多基于言论极性（如‘攻击性’和‘非攻击性’），本质上是仇恨言论检测，而现实中网络欺凌常通过事件引发广泛关注。

Method: 结合三种基于解释生成的网络欺凌检测方法作为集成方法生成伪标签，再由人工标注判断，并提出验证网络欺凌事件的评价标准。

Result: 构建的数据集可作为网络欺凌检测和事件预测任务的基准。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对中文网络欺凌事件检测任务的研究，数据集CHNCI具有开创性意义。

Abstract: Existing cyberbullying detection benchmarks were organized by the polarity of
speech, such as "offensive" and "non-offensive", which were essentially hate
speech detection. However, in the real world, cyberbullying often attracted
widespread social attention through incidents. To address this problem, we
propose a novel annotation method to construct a cyberbullying dataset that
organized by incidents. The constructed CHNCI is the first Chinese
cyberbullying incident detection dataset, which consists of 220,676 comments in
91 incidents. Specifically, we first combine three cyberbullying detection
methods based on explanations generation as an ensemble method to generate the
pseudo labels, and then let human annotators judge these labels. Then we
propose the evaluation criteria for validating whether it constitutes a
cyberbullying incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the constructed
dataset can be a benchmark for the tasks of cyberbullying detection and
incident prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for
the Chinese cyberbullying incident detection task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STL-DivEn的NL-STL数据集，包含16,000个样本，并通过知识引导的STL转换框架（KGST）实现了自然语言到STL的高效转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动将自然语言（NL）转换为信号时序逻辑（STL）耗时且易错，而现有数据集不足限制了自动转换的发展。

Method: 通过小规模种子集生成、聚类筛选、LLM扩展及规则过滤和人工验证构建STL-DivEn数据集，并开发了基于外部知识的KGST框架进行NL-STL转换。

Result: STL-DivEn数据集比现有数据集更具多样性，KGST框架在转换准确性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: STL-DivEn和KGST为NL-STL自动转换提供了有效解决方案，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise
formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an
attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which
is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets,
automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not
been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named
STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched
with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a
small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are
identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in
generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured
through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we
introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel
approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a
generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis
shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing
NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that
our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on
STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating
opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative
analysis, and decision support.

Method: 提出BacktrackAgent框架，包含验证器、判断器和反射器模块，并引入判断奖励机制，同时开发了针对回溯机制的专用训练数据集。

Result: 在Mobile3M和Auto-UI基准测试中，BacktrackAgent在任务成功率和步骤准确性上均表现更优。

Conclusion: BacktrackAgent通过回溯机制显著提升了GUI代理的性能，未来将公开数据和代码。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have gained substantial attention due
to their impressive capabilities to complete tasks through multiple
interactions within GUI environments. However, existing agents primarily focus
on enhancing the accuracy of individual actions and often lack effective
mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors. To address these
shortcomings, we propose the BacktrackAgent, a robust framework that
incorporates a backtracking mechanism to improve task completion efficiency.
BacktrackAgent includes verifier, judger, and reflector components as modules
for error detection and recovery, while also applying judgment rewards to
further enhance the agent's performance. Additionally, we develop a training
dataset specifically designed for the backtracking mechanism, which considers
the outcome pages after action executions. Experimental results show that
BacktrackAgent has achieved performance improvements in both task success rate
and step accuracy on Mobile3M and Auto-UI benchmarks. Our data and code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Self-Route框架通过动态选择推理模式，减少不必要的token消耗，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLLMs在简单问题上过度推理导致的资源浪费问题。

Method: 提出Self-Route框架，通过轻量级预推理阶段提取能力感知嵌入，动态选择推理模式。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Self-Route减少30-55%的token消耗，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: Self-Route具有广泛适用性和实用价值，适用于不同规模和推理范式的模型。

Abstract: While reasoning-augmented large language models (RLLMs) significantly enhance
complex task performance through extended reasoning chains, they inevitably
introduce substantial unnecessary token consumption, particularly for simpler
problems where Short Chain-of-Thought (Short CoT) suffices. This overthinking
phenomenon leads to inefficient resource usage without proportional accuracy
gains. To address this issue, we propose Self-Route, a dynamic reasoning
framework that automatically selects between general and reasoning modes based
on model capability estimation. Our approach introduces a lightweight
pre-inference stage to extract capability-aware embeddings from hidden layer
representations, enabling real-time evaluation of the model's ability to solve
problems. We further construct Gradient-10K, a model difficulty
estimation-based dataset with dense complexity sampling, to train the router
for precise capability boundary detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Self-Route achieves comparable accuracy to reasoning models while reducing
token consumption by 30-55\% across diverse benchmarks. The proposed framework
demonstrates consistent effectiveness across models with different parameter
scales and reasoning paradigms, highlighting its general applicability and
practical value.

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏命令行交互的执行数据（如退出码、输出等），限制了行为建模的实用性，因此需要一种新方法来生成更丰富的数据集。

Method: 将命令构建建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用语法掩码和PPO优化采样策略，生成高质量的命令行交互数据集。

Result: 语法掩码和PPO显著提升了样本效率，生成的数据集使CodeT5的BLEU-4分数提升了85%（语法掩码）和26%（PPO）。

Conclusion: ShIOEnv环境和生成的数据集为未来研究提供了工具，证明了小模型在命令行行为建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for
system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in
high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen,
large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar
level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required.
Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands,
omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental
side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a
Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as
a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose
actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and
returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length
behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial
argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to
mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and
proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and
grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We
observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency
to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while
minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output
behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements
in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an
additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and
curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在语言建模任务中性能接近参数翻倍的普通模型，下游任务中显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的‘思考’方法简单有效，能显著提升语言模型性能，且具有通用性。

Abstract: Humans ponder before articulating complex sentence elements, enabling deeper
cognitive processing through focused effort. In this work, we introduce this
pondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward
process within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of
generating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model
ponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the
predicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input
for another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this
way through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Our method
is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing
language models. Experiments across three widely used open-source
architectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For
language modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance
comparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters. On 9
downstream benchmarks, our pondering-enhanced Pythia models significantly
outperform the official Pythia models. Notably, pondering-enhanced Pythia-1B is
comparable to TinyLlama-1.1B, which is trained on 10 times more data. The code

Method: 构建MultiManip数据集，提出SELF-PERCEPT两阶段提示框架，基于自我感知理论。

Result: 现有LLM（如GPT-4o和Llama-3.1-8B）检测效果不佳，SELF-PERCEPT表现优异。

Conclusion: SELF-PERCEPT框架在多轮多人心理操纵检测中具有潜力，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of abuse in interpersonal
communication, making its detection critical for safeguarding potential
victims. However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature,
identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person
conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs).
To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220
multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and
non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic
real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct
manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various
prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle
to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose
SELF-PERCEPT, a novel, two-stage prompting framework inspired by
Self-Perception Theory, demonstrating strong performance in detecting
multi-person, multi-turn mental manipulation. Our code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/danushkhanna/self-percept .

Motivation: 评估英语F5-TTS模型在印度语言中的适应能力，探索低资源语言合成的最优策略。

Method: 比较三种方法：(i)从头训练，(ii)仅用印度数据微调，(iii)同时用印度和英语数据微调以防止遗忘。

Result: 仅用印度数据微调效果最好，IN-F5模型能实现跨语言流畅合成，并支持零资源语言的合成。

Conclusion: 英语预训练有助于低资源TTS达到人类水平，研究为其他低资源语言提供了计算优化策略。

Abstract: What happens when an English Fairytaler is fine-tuned on Indian languages? We
evaluate how the English F5-TTS model adapts to 11 Indian languages, measuring
polyglot fluency, voice-cloning, style-cloning, and code-mixing. We compare:
(i) training from scratch, (ii) fine-tuning English F5 on Indian data, and
(iii) fine-tuning on both Indian and English data to prevent forgetting.
Fine-tuning with only Indian data proves most effective and the resultant IN-F5
is a near-human polyglot; that enables speakers of one language (e.g., Odia) to
fluently speak in another (e.g., Hindi). Our results show English pretraining
aids low-resource TTS in reaching human parity. To aid progress in other
low-resource languages, we study data-constrained setups and arrive at a
compute optimal strategy. Finally, we show IN-F5 can synthesize unseen
languages like Bhojpuri and Tulu using a human-in-the-loop approach for
zero-resource TTS via synthetic data generation.

Motivation: 由于分布不匹配和模型容量限制，将大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力对齐到小语言模型（SLMs）具有挑战性。现有推理数据集通常针对强大的LLMs设计，直接应用于较弱模型时性能下降。

Method: 提出DART框架，通过选择性模仿策略和适应性估计，动态调整推理路径。当专家步骤超出学生能力时，学生自主探索替代路径。

Result: 在多个推理基准和模型规模上验证，DART显著提升了泛化能力和数据效率，优于静态微调。

Conclusion: DART通过将训练信号与学生的推理能力对齐，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限模型的推理对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet aligning such abilities to small language models (SLMs) remains a challenge
due to distributional mismatches and limited model capacity. Existing reasoning
datasets, typically designed for powerful LLMs, often lead to degraded
performance when directly applied to weaker models. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Adaptation of Reasoning Trajectories (DART), a novel data adaptation
framework that bridges the capability gap between expert reasoning trajectories
and diverse SLMs. Instead of uniformly imitating expert steps, DART employs a
selective imitation strategy guided by step-wise adaptability estimation via
solution simulation. When expert steps surpass the student's capacity --
signaled by an Imitation Gap -- the student autonomously explores alternative
reasoning paths, constrained by outcome consistency. We validate DART across
multiple reasoning benchmarks and model scales, demonstrating that it
significantly improves generalization and data efficiency over static
fine-tuning. Our method enhances supervision quality by aligning training
signals with the student's reasoning capabilities, offering a scalable solution
for reasoning alignment in resource-constrained models.

Method: 使用基于OpenStax高中物理教材的数据集，标注为Bloom分类法，并引入文化情境化方法。通过LLM-as-a-judge框架评估模型表现。

Result: Qwen 3 1.7B答案准确率85%，但完整推理正确率仅38%。数学表示格式对性能影响小，文化情境下推理一致性较高。

Conclusion: SLMs需提升真正理解和生成可靠推理链的能力，而非仅追求答案准确性，才能成为可靠教育工具。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, making them promising for educational applications. However,
their capacity for complex reasoning, particularly in domains such as physics,
remains underexplored. This study investigates the high school physics
reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art SLMs (under 4 billion parameters),
including instruct versions of Llama 3.2, Phi 4 Mini, Gemma 3, and Qwen series.
We developed a comprehensive physics dataset from the OpenStax High School
Physics textbook, annotated according to Bloom's Taxonomy, with LaTeX and
plaintext mathematical notations. A novel cultural contextualization approach
was applied to a subset, creating culturally adapted problems for Asian,
African, and South American/Australian contexts while preserving core physics
principles. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash,
we evaluated answer and reasoning chain correctness, along with calculation
accuracy. The results reveal significant differences between the SLMs. Qwen 3
1.7B achieved high `answer accuracy' (85%), but `fully correct reasoning' was
substantially low (38%). The format of the mathematical notation had a
negligible impact on performance. SLMs exhibited varied performance across the
physics topics and showed a decline in reasoning quality with increasing
cognitive and knowledge complexity. In particular, the consistency of reasoning
was largely maintained in diverse cultural contexts, especially by better
performing models. These findings indicate that, while SLMs can often find
correct answers, their underlying reasoning is frequently flawed, suggesting an
overreliance on pattern recognition. For SLMs to become reliable educational
tools in physics, future development must prioritize enhancing genuine
understanding and the generation of sound, verifiable reasoning chains over
mere answer accuracy.

Motivation: 强化学习在训练LLM代理处理复杂任务时面临延迟奖励的挑战，导致早期动作缺乏有效指导。

Method: 提出Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA)框架，训练进度估计器分解最终奖励为逐步贡献，结合环境信号作为中间奖励。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPA平均成功率提高2.5%，准确性提高1.9%，提供了更有效的中间奖励。

Conclusion: SPA通过逐步奖励分配显著提升了强化学习的训练效果，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents
to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions
with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to
these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically
available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to
assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance
regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,
we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the
cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise
Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that
decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its
incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train
a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory
to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the
estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in
the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent
training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop,
ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding
accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method
remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM-as-Benchmark-Generator方法中存在的自我偏差问题，并提出Silencer框架来中和偏差，生成高质量的无偏差基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，模型在其自生成基准测试上的性能被高估（自我偏差），但相关偏差问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统定义并验证自我偏差现象，分析其子偏差来源（问题领域、语言风格、错误标签），提出Silencer框架，利用多生成器的异质性中和偏差。

Result: Silencer能将自我偏差降至接近零，显著提升生成基准测试的评估效果（Pearson相关系数从0.655提升至0.833），并表现出强泛化性。

Conclusion: Silencer是一种通用框架，能有效中和自我偏差，生成高质量基准测试，提升评估效果。

Abstract: LLM-as-Benchmark-Generator methods have been widely studied as a supplement
to human annotators for scalable evaluation, while the potential biases within
this paradigm remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically define and
validate the phenomenon of inflated performance in models evaluated on their
self-generated benchmarks, referred to as self-bias, and attribute it to
sub-biases arising from question domain, language style, and wrong labels. On
this basis, we propose Silencer, a general framework that leverages the
heterogeneity between multiple generators at both the sample and benchmark
levels to neutralize bias and generate high-quality, self-bias-silenced
benchmark. Experimental results across various settings demonstrate that
Silencer can suppress self-bias to near zero, significantly improve evaluation
effectiveness of the generated benchmark (with an average improvement from
0.655 to 0.833 in Pearson correlation with high-quality human-annotated
benchmark), while also exhibiting strong generalizability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）生成的认知陈述忠实性的框架，并创建了一个基准数据集CogniBench-L。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对认知陈述（基于上下文推理的陈述）的评估标准，导致难以优化和评估其一致性。

Method: 受立法领域证据评估的启发，设计了一个严格框架来评估认知陈述的忠实性，并开发了自动标注流程以生成更大规模的基准数据集。

Result: 创建了CogniBench-L数据集，可用于训练准确的认知幻觉检测模型。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架和数据集为评估和优化LLM生成的认知陈述提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Faithfulness hallucination are claims generated by a Large Language Model
(LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment
standard, existing benchmarks only contain "factual statements" that rephrase
source materials without marking "cognitive statements" that make inference
from the given context, making the consistency evaluation and optimization of
cognitive statements difficult. Inspired by how an evidence is assessed in the
legislative domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels
of faithfulness of cognitive statements and create a benchmark dataset where we
reveal insightful statistics. We design an annotation pipeline to create larger
benchmarks for different LLMs automatically, and the resulting larger-scale
CogniBench-L dataset can be used to train accurate cognitive hallucination
detection model. We release our model and dataset at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecExtend通过集成高效注意力机制和跨模型检索策略，显著提升了长序列推测解码的性能，加速效果达2.22倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在长输入上性能下降，因注意力成本增加和草稿准确性降低。

Method: 结合FlashAttention和Hybrid Tree Attention，提出跨模型检索策略动态更新KV缓存。

Result: 在16K tokens的长输入上加速2.22倍。

Conclusion: SpecExtend为长序列推测解码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs
due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce
SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative
decoding on long sequences without any additional training. SpecExtend
integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid
Tree Attention into both the draft and target models, reducing latency across
all stages. To improve draft accuracy and speed, we propose Cross-model
Retrieval, a novel KV cache update strategy that uses the target model's
attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model.
Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that
SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x
for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative
decoding of long sequences. The code is available at

Conclusion: 结论是CHIMERA为研究概念重组提供了实证工具，并能推动跨领域创新预测。

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating
original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In
this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a
large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used
to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take
inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning
models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build
this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting
recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of
hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based
extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI
domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to
explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally,
we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts
new recombination directions that real-world researchers find inspiring. Our
data and code are available at https://github.cs.huji.ac.il/tomhope-lab/CHIMERA

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePS（Reference-free Preference Steering）是一种双向偏好优化方法，用于改进语言模型的表示导向，在概念引导和抑制方面优于现有方法，接近提示法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有权重或表示调整方法在语言模型行为控制上效果不如提示法，RePS旨在提供更有效且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 提出RePS，一种双向偏好优化目标，联合实现概念引导和抑制，并在不同规模的Gemma模型上进行训练和评估。

Result: RePS在AxBench基准测试中优于现有方法，接近提示法效果，且在抑制任务中表现优异，抗提示攻击能力强。

Conclusion: RePS为语言模型的行为控制提供了可解释、稳健的替代方案，尤其在抑制任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Steering methods for language models (LMs) seek to provide fine-grained and
interpretable control over model generations by variously changing model
inputs, weights, or representations to adjust behavior. Recent work has shown
that adjusting weights or representations is often less effective than steering
by prompting, for instance when wanting to introduce or suppress a particular
concept. We demonstrate how to improve representation steering via our new
Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS), a bidirectional
preference-optimization objective that jointly does concept steering and
suppression. We train three parameterizations of RePS and evaluate them on
AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark. On Gemma models with sizes
ranging from 2B to 27B, RePS outperforms all existing steering methods trained
with a language modeling objective and substantially narrows the gap with
prompting -- while promoting interpretability and minimizing parameter count.
In suppression, RePS matches the language-modeling objective on Gemma-2 and
outperforms it on the larger Gemma-3 variants while remaining resilient to
prompt-based jailbreaking attacks that defeat prompting. Overall, our results
suggest that RePS provides an interpretable and robust alternative to prompting
for both steering and suppression.

*Junsik Kim,Jinwook Park,Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的知识图谱嵌入方法RSCF，通过保持实体转换的一致性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实体转换前后的一致性问题上存在不足，可能导致嵌入中宝贵的归纳偏置丢失。

Method: RSCF方法包含三个特征：共享关系嵌入的仿射变换、根植的实体转换和归一化处理，并增加了关系转换和预测模块。

Result: 在基于距离和张量分解的模型中，RSCF显著优于现有方法，表现出对所有关系及其频率的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSCF通过保持语义一致性，有效提升了知识图谱嵌入的性能。

Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation-specific
entity-transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the
consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains
unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the
embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation
representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing
dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity-embeddings for similar
relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter
Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration
of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating
indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we
introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF),
containing more consistent entity-transformation characterized by three
features: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all
relations, 2) rooted entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its
change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the
change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency
that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and
prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion
tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all
relations and their frequencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一推理策略，忽视了多模态的独特性，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: MAMMQA包含两个视觉语言模型（VLM）智能体和一个文本大语言模型（LLM）智能体，分别负责分解问题、跨模态推理和整合答案。

Result: 在多模态问答基准测试中，MAMMQA在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MAMMQA通过模块化设计和多智能体协作，显著提升了多模态问答的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on
combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language
models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely
on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique
characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and
interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a
multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and
images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user
query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each
modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through
cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive
answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning
process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of
expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our
cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了知识编辑方法（KEs）的可追踪性和可逆性，特别是针对ROME方法。研究发现ROME编辑会在权重矩阵中引入独特的分布模式，可用于检测和部分重建编辑内容，并展示了如何逆转编辑以恢复模型原始输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识编辑方法（KEs）虽然能有效更新大型语言模型（LLMs）的事实内容，但也可能被恶意利用植入错误信息或偏见。因此，需要开发可靠的技术来检测、解释和缓解对抗性编辑。

Method: 研究聚焦于ROME方法，分析其编辑后权重矩阵的分布模式，提出通过权重推断编辑对象实体，并展示如何逆转编辑。

Result: 研究发现ROME编辑的权重具有可检测的模式，能高精度（≥95%）推断编辑对象，并能以≥80%的准确率逆转编辑。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于编辑权重的检测、追踪和逆转是可行的，为保护LLMs免受对抗性操纵提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the
factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk.
While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they
can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to
defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques
that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work
investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on
the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME
introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices,
which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second,
we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited
factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact.
Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity
directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt,
achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be
reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits
based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs
against adversarial manipulations.

Motivation: 长形式问答（LFQA）面临高质量训练数据稀缺、长输出幻觉风险增加以及缺乏可靠评估指标的挑战。

Method: 提出RioRAG框架，包括强化信息量优化训练范式和三阶段分层奖励建模方法。

Result: 在LongFact和RAGChecker基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: RioRAG通过强化学习和分层奖励建模，显著提升了长形式问答的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) presents unique challenges for large
language models, requiring the synthesis of coherent, paragraph-length answers.
While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising
solution, existing research struggles with key limitations: the scarcity of
high-quality training data for long-form generation, the compounding risk of
hallucination in extended outputs, and the absence of reliable evaluation
metrics for factual completeness. In this paper, we propose RioRAG, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that advances long-form RAG through
reinforced informativeness optimization. Our approach introduces two
fundamental innovations to address the core challenges. First, we develop an RL
training paradigm of reinforced informativeness optimization that directly
optimizes informativeness and effectively addresses the slow-thinking deficit
in conventional RAG systems, bypassing the need for expensive supervised data.
Second, we propose a nugget-centric hierarchical reward modeling approach that
enables precise assessment of long-form answers through a three-stage process:
extracting the nugget from every source webpage, constructing a nugget claim
checklist, and computing rewards based on factual alignment. Extensive
experiments on two LFQA benchmarks LongFact and RAGChecker demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Identifying factors that make ad text attractive is essential for advertising
success. This study proposes AdParaphrase v2.0, a dataset for ad text
paraphrasing, containing human preference data, to enable the analysis of the
linguistic factors and to support the development of methods for generating
attractive ad texts. Compared with v1.0, this dataset is 20 times larger,
comprising 16,460 ad text paraphrase pairs, each annotated with preference data
from ten evaluators, thereby enabling a more comprehensive and reliable
analysis. Through the experiments, we identified multiple linguistic features
of engaging ad texts that were not observed in v1.0 and explored various
methods for generating attractive ad texts. Furthermore, our analysis
demonstrated the relationships between human preference and ad performance, and
highlighted the potential of reference-free metrics based on large language
models for evaluating ad text attractiveness. The dataset is publicly available

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）能力的增强，其安全部署问题日益突出。尽管已有对齐机制防止滥用，但仍易受精心设计的对抗提示攻击。

Method: 提出意图隐藏对抗提示攻击策略，开发博弈论框架分析攻击与防御的交互，并设计针对性防御机制。

Result: 实证验证了攻击在多种现实LLMs上的有效性，显示出对现有对抗提示技术的明显优势。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了攻击者的结构性优势，并提出了有效的防御机制，为LLMs的安全部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, concerns about their safe
deployment have also grown. Although alignment mechanisms have been introduced
to deter misuse, they remain vulnerable to carefully designed adversarial
prompts. In this work, we present a scalable attack strategy: intent-hiding
adversarial prompting, which conceals malicious intent through the composition
of skills. We develop a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction
between such attacks and defense systems that apply both prompt and response
filtering. Our analysis identifies equilibrium points and reveals structural
advantages for the attacker. To counter these threats, we propose and analyze a
defense mechanism tailored to intent-hiding attacks. Empirically, we validate
the attack's effectiveness on multiple real-world LLMs across a range of
malicious behaviors, demonstrating clear advantages over existing adversarial
prompting techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强微调方法（RAFT）在缺乏可靠知识时仍会生成答案，这在高风险领域中不可靠。因此，需要一种方法让系统能够承认不确定性。

Method: DTA将数据样本划分为四个知识象限，并为每个象限构建定制的偏好数据，形成用于直接偏好优化（DPO）的精选数据集。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，DTA能有效平衡准确性和适当弃权，提升检索增强系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: DTA方法显著增强了检索增强系统在高风险领域中的可信度，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
significantly advanced natural language processing tasks by integrating
external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually rich
responses. To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals,
Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method.
However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of
reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes
domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we
propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG
systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out
of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's
internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and
constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated
dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with
appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of
retrieval-augmented systems.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在代码和数学任务中表现优异，但其在结构化空间知识内化方面的潜力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过模拟城市环境中的实验，测试LLMs在空间感知（推断全局布局）和空间导航（学习道路连接性并规划路径）方面的能力。

Result: LLMs能够泛化到未见过的空间关系，其潜在表示与现实空间分布一致，并能从轨迹数据中学习道路连接性以实现准确路径规划。

Conclusion: LLMs具备构建全局空间认知的潜力，尤其在空间感知和导航任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in tasks such as code and mathematics. However, their potential to
internalize structured spatial knowledge remains underexplored. This study
investigates whether LLMs, grounded in locally relative human observations, can
construct coherent global spatial cognition by integrating fragmented
relational descriptions. We focus on two core aspects of spatial cognition:
spatial perception, where models infer consistent global layouts from local
positional relationships, and spatial navigation, where models learn road
connectivity from trajectory data and plan optimal paths between unconnected
locations. Experiments conducted in a simulated urban environment demonstrate
that LLMs not only generalize to unseen spatial relationships between points of
interest (POIs) but also exhibit latent representations aligned with real-world
spatial distributions. Furthermore, LLMs can learn road connectivity from
trajectory descriptions, enabling accurate path planning and dynamic spatial
awareness during navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要基于标准美式英语（SAE）评估，忽视了全球英语多样性，可能导致公平性问题。

Method: 结合语言学专家知识和LLM驱动的转换，将SAE数据集自动转换为38种英语变体，评估7种先进LLMs。

Result: 非标准英语变体上模型性能下降高达46.3%，显示显著性能差异。

Conclusion: 强调跨多样英语变体全面评估语言鲁棒性的重要性，Trans-EnV框架公开可用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American
English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties.
This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on
non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide.
Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of
LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a
framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English
varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1)
linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and
transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2)
LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability.
Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties
and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant
performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on
non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of
comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English
varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second
language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our

ensemble verification mechanism, where a primary model extracts hallucination
spans and three independent LLMs adjudicate their validity through
probability-based voting. This framework simulates the human annotation
workflow used in the shared task validation and test data. Additionally, fuzzy
matching refines span alignment. Our system ranked 1st in Arabic and Basque,
2nd in German, Swedish, and Finnish, and 3rd in Czech, Farsi, and French.

### [75] [Dub-S2ST: Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation for Seamless Dubbing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20899)
*Jeongsoo Choi,Jaehun Kim,Joon Son Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跨语言配音系统，通过离散扩散模型和显式时长控制实现时间对齐的语音翻译，同时保留说话人身份和语速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音翻译方法虽翻译质量高，但常忽略语音模式的转移，导致与源语音不匹配，限制了其在配音应用中的适用性。

Method: 提出基于离散扩散的语音到单元翻译模型，结合显式时长控制实现时间对齐翻译，并通过条件流匹配模型合成语音。引入基于单元的语速适应机制。

Result: 实验表明，该系统生成的翻译自然流畅，与源语音的时长和语速一致，且翻译性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语言配音提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了语音翻译在配音应用中的适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech
from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as
duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation
quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the
transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and
limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we
propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with
explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then
synthesize speech based on the predicted units and source identity with a
conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed
adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a
rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent
translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace,
while achieving competitive translation performance.

TL;DR: 该研究针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）可能学习并生成社会偏见和刻板印象的问题，提出了基于刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的新评估指标和基准数据集BASIC，用于评估性别、种族和颜色刻板印象。研究发现SCM方法有效，LVLMs存在颜色刻板印象，且模型架构与参数规模可能影响刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型的快速发展，其可能学习并生成社会偏见和刻板印象的问题日益受到关注。此前研究在指标和数据集上存在不足，本研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出基于刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的新评估指标，并构建BASIC基准数据集，用于评估性别、种族和颜色刻板印象。对八种LVLMs进行了研究。

Result: 研究发现：（1）SCM方法能有效捕捉刻板印象；（2）LVLMs输出中存在颜色、性别和种族刻板印象；（3）模型架构与参数规模的交互可能影响刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究通过新指标和数据集揭示了LVLMs的刻板印象问题，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: As large vision language models(LVLMs) rapidly advance, concerns about their
potential to learn and generate social biases and stereotypes are increasing.
Previous studies on LVLM's stereotypes face two primary limitations: metrics
that overlooked the importance of content words, and datasets that overlooked
the effect of color. To address these limitations, this study introduces new
evaluation metrics based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We also propose
BASIC, a benchmark for assessing gender, race, and color stereotypes. Using SCM
metrics and BASIC, we conduct a study with eight LVLMs to discover stereotypes.
As a result, we found three findings. (1) The SCM-based evaluation is effective
in capturing stereotypes. (2) LVLMs exhibit color stereotypes in the output
along with gender and race ones. (3) Interaction between model architecture and
parameter sizes seems to affect stereotypes. We release BASIC publicly on
[anonymized for review].

*Ziming Wang,Zeyu Shi,Haoyi Zhou,Shiqi Gao,Qingyun Sun,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调后的LLMs由于先验知识的影响，校准性较差。CogCalib框架通过针对性学习策略显著改善了校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的先验知识在微调过程中对校准性的影响，揭示其与校准性的矛盾关系。

Method: 提出CogCalib框架，根据模型的先验知识应用针对性学习策略。

Result: 在7个任务和3种LLM家族中，CogCalib显著改善了校准性，ECE平均降低57%。

Conclusion: CogCalib提升了LLMs的校准性和可靠性，适用于关键人机交互应用。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration,
with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While
calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the
impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains
understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential
poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world
fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned
with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge
improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic
knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through
unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a
cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according
to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families
prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining
performance, achieving an average 57\% reduction in ECE compared to standard
fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain
tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and
making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动检测用户与大型语言模型交互中隐私泄露的方法，并构建了一个大规模多语言数据集用于开发和评估本地隐私检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在与大型语言模型交互时可能无意泄露隐私信息，现有隐私检测方法不适用于此类场景，因此需要开发新的方法。

Method: 构建了一个包含249K用户查询和154K标注隐私短语的数据集，使用云端强LLM自动标注隐私信息，并设计了多层次的评估指标。

Result: 基线方法显示当前性能与真实应用需求存在差距，需要进一步研究更有效的本地隐私检测方法。

Conclusion: 论文为本地隐私检测提供了数据集和基线方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real
identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information.
Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which
phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need.
Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different
objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable
information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the
development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions
that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale
multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases.
In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with
cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue
datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at
the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy
information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with
both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive
evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between
current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications,
motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods
grounded in our dataset.

TL;DR: LLM-AT框架自动选择LLM层级以平衡成本与性能，无需训练，通过迭代升级模型直至获得有效响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂NLP任务中如何选择合适的LLM层级以平衡成本与性能的问题。

Method: LLM-AT由Starter、Generator和Judge组成，通过初始选择、生成响应、评估有效性并迭代升级模型。

Result: 实验表明LLM-AT在降低成本的同时实现优异性能。

Conclusion: LLM-AT是实际应用中平衡成本与性能的实用解决方案。

Abstract: LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and
price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable
LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and
performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission
(LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training.
LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the
initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a
response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the
validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively
upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates
until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy
estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without
training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected
accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k
similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that
LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a
practical solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法难以有效平衡多目标之间的权衡，常需昂贵重训练或导致帕累托前沿上的次优结果。

Method: HoE由三个层次组件组成：LoRA Experts、Router Experts和Preference Routing，旨在实现参数规模、训练成本和性能之间的权衡。

Result: 在14个目标和6个基准测试中的200种不同偏好下，HoE表现优于15个基线方法。

Conclusion: HoE是一种高效且灵活的多目标对齐方法，无需训练即可适应多样化偏好，性能优越。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously satisfy multiple
objectives remains a significant challenge, especially given the diverse and
often conflicting nature of human preferences. Existing alignment methods
struggle to balance trade-offs effectively, often requiring costly retraining
or yielding suboptimal results across the Pareto frontier of preferences. In
this paper, we introduce \textit{HoE}(Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts), a
\textit{lightweight}, \textit{parameter-efficient}, and \textit{plug-and-play}
approach that eliminates the need for model training, while enabling LLMs to
adapt across the entire Pareto frontier and accommodate diverse user
preferences. In particular, \textit{HoE} consists of three hierarchical
components: LoRA Experts, Router Experts and Preference Routing, reaching
optimal Pareto frontiers and achieving a trade-off between parameter size,
training cost, and performance. We evaluate \textit{HoE} across various tasks
on 14 objectives and 200 different preferences among 6 benchmarks,
demonstrating superior performance over 15 recent baselines. Code is available
in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: InfoComp是一种新的连续文本分类方法，通过分离任务特定和任务无关的提示空间，利用信息论框架优化学习，显著减少灾难性遗忘并提升知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注任务特定知识，忽视了共享知识的重要性，而互补学习系统理论表明人类通过两种系统交互学习，启发设计InfoComp。

Method: InfoComp学习两个提示空间（P-Prompt和S-Prompt），分别编码任务特定和任务无关知识，并通过信息论框架优化学习。设计了两种损失函数分别优化两种提示空间。

Result: 在多个连续文本分类基准测试中，InfoComp优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InfoComp通过分离和优化两种提示空间，有效解决了灾难性遗忘和知识迁移问题，为连续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Text Classification (CTC) aims to continuously classify new text
data over time while minimizing catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired
knowledge. However, existing methods often focus on task-specific knowledge,
overlooking the importance of shared, task-agnostic knowledge. Inspired by the
complementary learning systems theory, which posits that humans learn
continually through the interaction of two systems -- the hippocampus,
responsible for forming distinct representations of specific experiences, and
the neocortex, which extracts more general and transferable representations
from past experiences -- we introduce Information-Theoretic Complementary
Prompts (InfoComp), a novel approach for CTC. InfoComp explicitly learns two
distinct prompt spaces: P(rivate)-Prompt and S(hared)-Prompt. These
respectively encode task-specific and task-invariant knowledge, enabling models
to sequentially learn classification tasks without relying on data replay. To
promote more informative prompt learning, InfoComp uses an
information-theoretic framework that maximizes mutual information between
different parameters (or encoded representations). Within this framework, we
design two novel loss functions: (1) to strengthen the accumulation of
task-specific knowledge in P-Prompt, effectively mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, and (2) to enhance the retention of task-invariant knowledge in
S-Prompt, improving forward knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on
diverse CTC benchmarks show that our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs的优势与局限性，并提出了一种新的表情包理解策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic analysis of
vision-language models (VLMs) for disparate meme classification tasks. We
introduced a novel approach that generates a VLM-based understanding of meme
images and fine-tunes the LLMs on textual understanding of the embedded meme
text for improving the performance. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
Benchmarking VLMs with diverse prompting strategies purposely to each sub-task;
(2) Evaluating LoRA fine-tuning across all VLM components to assess performance
gains; and (3) Proposing a novel approach where detailed meme interpretations
generated by VLMs are used to train smaller language models (LLMs),
significantly improving classification. The strategy of combining VLMs with
LLMs improved the baseline performance by 8.34%, 3.52% and 26.24% for sarcasm,
offensive and sentiment classification, respectively. Our results reveal the
strengths and limitations of VLMs and present a novel strategy for meme
understanding.

Result: 研究发现，研究者普遍认同智能的三大标准：泛化能力、适应性和推理能力；仅29%的人认为当前NLP系统“智能”，16.2%的人将开发智能系统视为研究目标。

Conclusion: 结论指出，当前NLP系统被广泛认为缺乏真正的“智能”，且开发智能系统并非主流研究目标。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of ''artificial intelligence'' (AI) framing in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, it is not clear what researchers
mean by ''intelligence''. To that end, we present the results of a survey on
the notion of ''intelligence'' among researchers and its role in the research
agenda. The survey elicited complete responses from 303 researchers from a
variety of fields including NLP, Machine Learning (ML), Cognitive Science,
Linguistics, and Neuroscience. We identify 3 criteria of intelligence that the
community agrees on the most: generalization, adaptability, & reasoning. Our
results suggests that the perception of the current NLP systems as
''intelligent'' is a minority position (29%). Furthermore, only 16.2% of the
respondents see developing intelligent systems as a research goal, and these
respondents are more likely to consider the current systems intelligent.

Motivation: 在线讨论的增加需要高级自动内容审核，但德语报纸论坛的研究有限，且现有研究常忽略平台特定上下文。

Method: 使用LSTM、CNN和ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo模型，结合上下文信息，基于奥地利报纸Der Standard的One Million Posts Corpus进行评估。

Result: CNN和LSTM模型在上下文信息下表现优异，而ChatGPT的零样本分类未因上下文提升且表现较差。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对LSTM和CNN模型有显著提升，而ChatGPT在此任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: The increasing volume of online discussions requires advanced automatic
content moderation to maintain responsible discourse. While hate speech
detection on social media is well-studied, research on German-language
newspaper forums remains limited. Existing studies often neglect
platform-specific context, such as user history and article themes. This paper
addresses this gap by developing and evaluating binary classification models
for automatic content moderation in German newspaper forums, incorporating
contextual information. Using LSTM, CNN, and ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and leveraging
the One Million Posts Corpus from the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, we
assess the impact of context-aware models. Results show that CNN and LSTM
models benefit from contextual information and perform competitively with
state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast, ChatGPT's zero-shot classification
does not improve with added context and underperforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAC系统存在两个主要问题：一是用户个性化表示不足，二是查询前缀可能生成有毒内容，影响用户体验和品牌形象。

Method: LaD模型分层捕获用户的长短期兴趣，并结合基于拒绝偏好优化（RPO）的在线训练方法，实现自适应去毒。

Conclusion: LaD成功解决了QAC系统中的个性化表示和去毒问题，为大规模应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Query auto-completion (QAC) plays a crucial role in modern search systems.
However, in real-world applications, there are two pressing challenges that
still need to be addressed. First, there is a need for hierarchical
personalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used
users' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves
inadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes
are typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing
the likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text
generation tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to
public relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is
detoxifying QAC systems.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that
captures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,
incorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is
captured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This
approach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling
online generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an
online training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By
incorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference
processes, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the
generated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given
prefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and
perform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric
improvement in nearly two years of our product. Our model has been deployed on
Kuaishou search, driving the primary traffic for hundreds of millions of active
users. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/LaD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现出色但存在幻觉问题，而KGs提供结构化知识但缺乏灵活推理能力。RAR旨在结合两者优势。

Method: RAR包含三个组件：Reasoner生成推理链，Aligner将其映射到KG路径，Responser合成最终答案。采用EM算法优化。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ上分别达到93.3%和91.0%的Hit@1分数，零样本泛化能力强且推理高效。

Conclusion: RAR有效整合LLM与KG，显著提升KGQA性能，生成高质量且可解释的推理链。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks,
yet they often suffer from hallucinations and lack reliable factual grounding.
Meanwhile, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured factual knowledge but lack
the flexible reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we present
Reason-Align-Respond (RAR), a novel framework that systematically integrates
LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs for KGQA. Our approach consists of three
key components: a Reasoner that generates human-like reasoning chains, an
Aligner that maps these chains to valid KG paths, and a Responser that
synthesizes the final answer. We formulate this process as a probabilistic
model and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which
iteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with Hit@1 scores of 93.3% and 91.0% on
WebQSP and CWQ respectively. Human evaluation confirms that RAR generates
high-quality, interpretable reasoning chains well-aligned with KG paths.
Furthermore, RAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities and
maintains computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: LLM反向生成树库结合对比学习预训练，显著提升了跨领域选区解析的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain constituency parsing is still an unsolved challenge in
computational linguistics since the available multi-domain constituency
treebank is limited. We investigate automatic treebank generation by large
language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency
parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM
back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency
parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency
tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words
to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce
a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the
LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify
the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive
learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average results
compared with various baselines.

Conclusion: MLLMs存在模态偏好，可通过表示工程方法调控，为多模态任务优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
on complex tasks with multimodal context. However, it is still understudied
whether they exhibit modality preference when processing multimodal contexts.
To study this question, we first build a \textbf{MC\textsuperscript{2}}
benchmark under controlled evidence conflict scenarios to systematically
evaluate modality preference, which is the tendency to favor one modality over
another when making decisions based on multimodal conflicting evidence. Our
extensive evaluation reveals that all 18 tested MLLMs generally demonstrate
clear modality bias, and modality preference can be influenced by external
interventions. An in-depth analysis reveals that the preference direction can
be captured within the latent representations of MLLMs. Built on this, we
propose a probing and steering method based on representation engineering to
explicitly control modality preference without additional fine-tuning or
carefully crafted prompts. Our method effectively amplifies modality preference
toward a desired direction and applies to downstream tasks such as
hallucination mitigation and multimodal machine translation, yielding promising
improvements.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM可解释性提供了新视角，并为更高效的针对性训练策略开辟了途径。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), the
process of endowing them with new capabilities--such as mathematical
reasoning--remains largely empirical and opaque. A critical open question is
whether reasoning abilities stem from the entire model, specific modules, or
are merely artifacts of overfitting. In this work, we hypothesize that the
reasoning capabilities in well-trained LLMs are primarily attributed to the
output projection module (oproj) in the Transformer's multi-head self-attention
(MHSA) mechanism. To support this hypothesis, we introduce Stethoscope for
Networks (SfN), a suite of diagnostic tools designed to probe and analyze the
internal behaviors of LLMs. Using SfN, we provide both circumstantial and
empirical evidence suggesting that oproj plays a central role in enabling
reasoning, whereas other modules contribute more to fluent dialogue. These
findings offer a new perspective on LLM interpretability and open avenues for
more targeted training strategies, potentially enabling more efficient and
specialized LLMs.

### [90] [Articulatory strategy in vowel production as a basis for speaker discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20995)
*Justin J. H. Lo,Patrycja Strycharczuk,Sam Kirkham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了发音策略在元音产生中是否具有足够的说话者特异性，可用于说话者区分。通过分析40名英语说话者的舌形数据，发现舌大小是最具区分性的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 说话者的发音方式存在个体差异，同时受解剖和生物力学约束。研究旨在验证这些差异是否足以用于说话者区分。

Method: 使用广义Procrustes分析对40名英语说话者的舌形数据进行分析，并在似然比框架下评估舌形特征的区分能力。

Result: 舌大小是最具区分性的特征，前部舌形变化比后部更具区分性。形状信息在无说话者级协变时可与大小和形状信息媲美。

Conclusion: 舌形特征可用于说话者区分，尤其是舌大小和前部舌形变化，但需注意说话者级协变的影响。

Abstract: The way speakers articulate is well known to be variable across individuals
while at the same time subject to anatomical and biomechanical constraints. In
this study, we ask whether articulatory strategy in vowel production can be
sufficiently speaker-specific to form the basis for speaker discrimination. We
conducted Generalised Procrustes Analyses of tongue shape data from 40 English
speakers from the North West of England, and assessed the
speaker-discriminatory potential of orthogonal tongue shape features within the
framework of likelihood ratios. Tongue size emerged as the individual dimension
with the strongest discriminatory power, while tongue shape variation in the
more anterior part of the tongue generally outperformed tongue shape variation
in the posterior part. When considered in combination, shape-only information
may offer comparable levels of speaker specificity to size-and-shape
information, but only when features do not exhibit speaker-level co-variation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了长上下文学习（ICL）中增加示例对预测不确定性的影响，填补了现有研究在可信度方面的空白。通过分解不确定性，发现更多示例能通过减少认知不确定性（EU）提升性能，尤其在复杂任务中需先解决输入噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注性能提升，而忽略了示例数量对生成响应可信度的影响，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统量化不同示例数量下的ICL不确定性，分解不确定性并重点分析认知不确定性（EU），探究示例数量对性能的影响。

Result: 更多示例通过注入任务特定知识减少总不确定性，降低EU并提升性能；复杂任务需先解决输入噪声问题才能显现优势。

Conclusion: 增加示例能有效减少不确定性，提升ICL的可信度和性能，尤其在复杂任务中需注意噪声管理。

Abstract: Recent advances in handling long sequences have facilitated the exploration
of long-context in-context learning (ICL). While much of the existing research
emphasizes performance improvements driven by additional in-context examples,
the influence on the trustworthiness of generated responses remains
underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how increased
examples influence predictive uncertainty, an essential aspect in
trustworthiness. We begin by systematically quantifying the uncertainty of ICL
with varying shot counts, analyzing the impact of example quantity. Through
uncertainty decomposition, we introduce a novel perspective on performance
enhancement, with a focus on epistemic uncertainty (EU). Our results reveal
that additional examples reduce total uncertainty in both simple and complex
tasks by injecting task-specific knowledge, thereby diminishing EU and
enhancing performance. For complex tasks, these advantages emerge only after
addressing the increased noise and uncertainty associated with longer inputs.
Finally, we explore the evolution of internal confidence across layers,
unveiling the mechanisms driving the reduction in uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在NLI任务微调中实际学习的内容及其性能提升的潜在机制。

Method: 分析NLI数据集中前提和假设的谓词频率，评估模型在频率偏差一致和对抗性案例中的表现，并利用WordNet分析上下位词频率。

Result: LLMs依赖频率偏差进行推理，微调后对偏差的依赖显著增加，且频率偏差与文本蕴含相关。

Conclusion: 频率偏差的学习解释了模型在推理任务中性能提升的原因。

Abstract: While fine-tuning LLMs on NLI corpora improves their inferential performance,
the underlying mechanisms driving this improvement remain largely opaque. In
this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually
learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in
premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency
bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in
premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate
both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial
cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform
poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit
significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are
learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the
frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet,
revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These
findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model
performance on inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话主题分割（DTS）在NLP任务中至关重要，但面临数据短缺、标注模糊和解决方案复杂度高的问题，而LLM和推理策略的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用LLM的多步演绎推理，包括双向上下文摘要、通用意图分类和演绎主题转移检测。

Result: 在多种对话场景中，Def-DTS表现优于传统和前沿方法，显著减少第二类错误。

Conclusion: Def-DTS展示了LLM推理技术在DTS中的潜力，并探索了自动标注的可能性。

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) aims to divide dialogues into coherent
segments. DTS plays a crucial role in various NLP downstream tasks, but suffers
from chronic problems: data shortage, labeling ambiguity, and incremental
complexity of recently proposed solutions. On the other hand, Despite advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) and reasoning strategies, these have rarely
been applied to DTS. This paper introduces Def-DTS: Deductive Reasoning for
Open-domain Dialogue Topic Segmentation, which utilizes LLM-based multi-step
deductive reasoning to enhance DTS performance and enable case study using
intermediate result. Our method employs a structured prompting approach for
bidirectional context summarization, utterance intent classification, and
deductive topic shift detection. In the intent classification process, we
propose the generalizable intent list for domain-agnostic dialogue intent
classification. Experiments in various dialogue settings demonstrate that
Def-DTS consistently outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches,
with each subtask contributing to improved performance, particularly in
reducing type 2 error. We also explore the potential for autolabeling,
emphasizing the importance of LLM reasoning techniques in DTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多采用粗粒度知识转移方法，忽略了方面与情感关系的细粒度控制，导致负迁移问题。

Method: 提出FCKT框架，显式结合方面级信息进行细粒度知识转移。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FCKT优于多种基线和大语言模型（LLMs）。

Conclusion: FCKT通过细粒度知识转移有效解决了TSA任务中的负迁移问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of targeted sentiment analysis (TSA),
which involves two sub-tasks, i.e., identifying specific aspects from reviews
and determining their corresponding sentiments. Aspect extraction forms the
foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency
between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most
existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific
features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over
aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity
within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that
differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer
framework tailored for TSA. By explicitly incorporating aspect-level
information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge
transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task
performance. Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various
baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of
FCKT. The source code is available on https://github.com/cwei01/FCKT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测轮换模型主要依赖语音，忽略了视觉线索在轮换中的重要性。

Method: 结合语音和视觉特征（面部表情、头部姿势和注视），并对不同静默时长的轮换分组分析。

Result: MM-VAP在所有轮换时长中均优于仅音频模型，面部表情特征对性能贡献最大。

Conclusion: 视觉线索对轮换预测至关重要，未来研究应纳入多模态数据。

Abstract: Turn-taking is richly multimodal. Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs)
facilitate naturalistic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on
speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with
visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it
outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconferencing interactions
(84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which
aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns.
This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms
a state-of-the-art audio-only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker
transitions. We conduct a detailed ablation study, which reveals that facial
expression features contribute the most to model performance. Thus, our working
hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are
vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking
prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of automatic speech
alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the
first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for
future work and make all code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义角色标注（SRL）基准常忽略隐式参数，导致对步骤理解的不足，尤其在高度省略的流程性文本中。

Method: 引入Implicit-VidSRL数据集，要求从多模态烹饪流程中推断隐式和显式参数，并测试多模态模型的上下文推理能力。

Result: 多模态大模型在预测隐式参数时表现不佳，而提出的iSRL-Qwen2-VL模型在F1分数上相对GPT-4o提升了17%（what）和14.7%（where/with）。

Conclusion: Implicit-VidSRL和iSRL-Qwen2-VL显著提升了隐式语义角色的理解能力，为多模态流程性文本的上下文推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Procedural texts help AI enhance reasoning about context and action
sequences. Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves
understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure
like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for
instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second
step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the
cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments,
leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce
Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit
arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our
proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring
entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal
LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and
where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose
iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for
what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.

Motivation: RAG系统在开放域问答中表现优异，但仍易产生幻觉（事实错误）。现有方法常将事实性与忠实性混淆，导致误判。

Method: 提出FRANQ方法，基于忠实性应用不同不确定性量化技术，评估事实性。同时构建了一个新的长形式问答数据集用于评估。

Result: 实验表明，FRANQ在多数据集和LLMs上，相比现有方法能更准确地检测RAG生成响应中的事实错误。

Conclusion: FRANQ通过结合忠实性和不确定性量化，有效提升了RAG系统中幻觉检测的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external knowledge retrieval, an
approach known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have shown strong
performance in open-domain question answering. However, RAG systems remain
susceptible to hallucinations: factually incorrect outputs that may arise
either from inconsistencies in the model's internal knowledge or incorrect use
of the retrieved context. Existing approaches often conflate factuality with
faithfulness to the retrieved context, misclassifying factually correct
statements as hallucinations if they are not directly supported by the
retrieval. In this paper, we introduce FRANQ (Faithfulness-based Retrieval
Augmented UNcertainty Quantification), a novel method for hallucination
detection in RAG outputs. FRANQ applies different Uncertainty Quantification
(UQ) techniques to estimate factuality based on whether a statement is faithful
to the retrieved context or not. To evaluate FRANQ and other UQ techniques for
RAG, we present a new long-form Question Answering (QA) dataset annotated for
both factuality and faithfulness, combining automated labeling with manual
validation of challenging examples. Extensive experiments on long- and
short-form QA across multiple datasets and LLMs show that FRANQ achieves more
accurate detection of factual errors in RAG-generated responses compared to
existing methods.

Motivation: 黑盒LLM虽然强大，但其通用响应往往忽视个人偏好和推理风格。现有方法主要关注响应级个性化，未能建模个人思维过程。

Method: RPM通过提取用户历史中的特征构建统计用户特定因素，并构建个性化推理路径。在推理阶段，通过特征级相似性检索对齐的推理示例，使模型遵循用户特定的推理轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，RPM在多样任务中一致优于响应级个性化方法，提升了预测准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 推理级个性化是优化黑盒LLM输出的有效方法，RPM框架为此提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in
real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without
access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and
ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically
produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning
styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization,
which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying
model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on
response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without
modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM,
a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's
reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs
statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping
response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized
reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the
inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via
feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured
factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow
user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization
enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model
outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive
experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms
response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of
reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

Method: 构建包含2366道多选题的BLUCK数据集，涵盖23个类别，测试6个专有和3个开源LLMs的性能。

Result: LLMs在孟加拉语音学方面表现较差，整体表现尚可，但不及主流语言（如英语）。

Conclusion: BLUCK是首个专注于孟加拉本土文化的评估基准，表明孟加拉语是一种中等资源语言。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce BLUCK, a new dataset designed to measure the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Bengali linguistic understanding
and cultural knowledge. Our dataset comprises 2366 multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) carefully curated from compiled collections of several college and job
level examinations and spans 23 categories covering knowledge on Bangladesh's
culture and history and Bengali linguistics. We benchmarked BLUCK using 6
proprietary and 3 open-source LLMs - including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeekV3. Our results show that
while these models perform reasonably well overall, they, however, struggles in
some areas of Bengali phonetics. Although current LLMs' performance on Bengali
cultural and linguistic contexts is still not comparable to that of mainstream
languages like English, our results indicate Bengali's status as a mid-resource
language. Importantly, BLUCK is also the first MCQ-based evaluation benchmark
that is centered around native Bengali culture, history, and linguistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在QA任务中的搜索行为不精确且缺乏自信，导致冗长回答和验证不足，受心理学双过程理论启发，试图改进这一问题。

Method: 提出四阶段任务：快速思考（严格token限制）、验证、慢速思考（深思熟虑）和总结，以优化LLM的推理过程。

Result: Qwen2.5-1.5B准确率从24.9%提升至27.9%，DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B从45.9%提升至49.8%，且快速思考模式效率显著。

Conclusion: 直觉与深思熟虑推理是互补系统，针对性训练可显著提升LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long
context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the
self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior
is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses
and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the
Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA
task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within
a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial
response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more
deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the
previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy
from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for
DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone
achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial
inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and
deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from
targeted training.

Result: SLG在Exact Match指标上优于传统方法3倍，微调速度快1.7倍。

Conclusion: SLG为中小型工程公司提供了经济高效的生成式AI解决方案，并可能推动分布式AI系统发展。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in domain adaptation techniques for large
language models, these methods remain computationally intensive, and the
resulting models can still exhibit hallucination issues. Most existing
adaptation methods do not prioritize reducing the computational resources
required for fine-tuning and inference of language models. Hallucination issues
have gradually decreased with each new model release. However, they remain
prevalent in engineering contexts, where generating well-structured text with
minimal errors and inconsistencies is critical. This work introduces a novel
approach called the Small Language Graph (SLG), which is a lightweight
adaptation solution designed to address the two key challenges outlined above.
The system is structured in the form of a graph, where each node represents a
lightweight expert - a small language model fine-tuned on specific and concise
texts. The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass
conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times.
Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of
a larger stand-alone language model. These findings introduce a potential for
small to medium-sized engineering companies to confidently use generative AI
technologies, such as LLMs, without the necessity to invest in expensive
computational resources. Also, the graph architecture and the small size of
expert nodes offer a possible opportunity for distributed AI systems, thus
potentially diverting the global need for expensive centralized compute
clusters.

Conclusion: EverGreenQA和EG-E5为LLMs在时间性问答任务中的改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate in question answering (QA)
tasks. A key yet underexplored factor contributing to this is the temporality
of questions -- whether they are evergreen (answers remain stable over time) or
mutable (answers change). In this work, we introduce EverGreenQA, the first
multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, supporting both evaluation and
training. Using EverGreenQA, we benchmark 12 modern LLMs to assess whether they
encode question temporality explicitly (via verbalized judgments) or implicitly
(via uncertainty signals). We also train EG-E5, a lightweight multilingual
classifier that achieves SoTA performance on this task. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical utility of evergreen classification across three applications:
improving self-knowledge estimation, filtering QA datasets, and explaining
GPT-4o retrieval behavior.

Motivation: 传统SGEC系统依赖级联模块，而端到端语音基础模型的兴起为SGEC和反馈生成提供了新的可能性，但面临标注数据有限的挑战。

Method: 采用伪标注技术将训练数据从77小时扩展到约2500小时，并基于Whisper模型进行提示训练。

Result: 伪标注数据显著提升了性能，提示训练在反馈生成中效果更明显，但模型大小增加时伪标注数据未带来额外收益。

Conclusion: 端到端模型在SGEC和反馈生成中具有潜力，提示训练和伪标注技术是有效的改进手段。

Abstract: Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) and Feedback (SGECF) are crucial
for second language learners, teachers and test takers. Traditional SGEC
systems rely on a cascaded pipeline consisting of an ASR, a module for
disfluency detection (DD) and removal and one for GEC. With the rise of
end-to-end (E2E) speech foundation models, we investigate their effectiveness
in SGEC and feedback generation. This work introduces a pseudo-labelling
process to address the challenge of limited labelled data, expanding the
training data size from 77 hours to approximately 2500 hours, leading to
improved performance. Additionally, we prompt an E2E Whisper-based SGEC model
with fluent transcriptions, showing a slight improvement in SGEC performance,
with more significant gains in feedback generation. Finally, we assess the
impact of increasing model size, revealing that while pseudo-labelled data does
not yield performance gain for a larger Whisper model, training with prompts
proves beneficial.

Motivation: 由于中文方言和口语音频数据的稀缺性，现有ASR模型在此类任务上表现不佳，研究旨在探索自监督学习与LLM结合的有效性。

Method: 使用30万小时无标签方言和口语音频数据预训练Data2vec2模型，并在4万小时有监督数据上进行对齐训练，随后研究不同投影器和LLM对识别性能的影响。

Result: 在包括Kespeech在内的多个方言数据集上取得了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练与LLM结合能显著提升中文方言和口语音频识别性能，研究结果将开源以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of
ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese
accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent
advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre-
training, combined with large language models (LLM), can effectively enhance
ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the
effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train
a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech
data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then,
we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on
Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this
paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets,
including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible
research

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多模态大语言模型（LLMs）在L2英语口语能力评分中的潜力，通过回归和分类目标比较不同训练策略，结果显示语音LLMs优于现有基线，并表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着L2英语学习者数量增加，自动评分需求上升，但现有方法（统计模型、文本编码器、自监督语音模型）存在信息丢失或局限性，多模态LLMs为解决这些问题提供了新方向。

Method: 采用多模态LLMs，比较回归和分类目标的训练策略，评估其在两个数据集上的表现及跨部分或跨任务的泛化能力。

Result: 语音LLMs在性能上超越所有竞争基线，并在跨部分或跨任务评估中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态LLMs在L2口语评分中具有显著潜力，其预训练获得的音频理解知识有助于提升评分系统的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: The growing population of L2 English speakers has increased the demand for
developing automatic graders for spoken language assessment (SLA).
Historically, statistical models, text encoders, and self-supervised speech
models have been utilised for this task. However, cascaded systems suffer from
the loss of information, while E2E graders also have limitations. With the
recent advancements of multi-modal large language models (LLMs), we aim to
explore their potential as L2 oral proficiency graders and overcome these
issues. In this work, we compare various training strategies using regression
and classification targets. Our results show that speech LLMs outperform all
previous competitive baselines, achieving superior performance on two datasets.
Furthermore, the trained grader demonstrates strong generalisation capabilities
in the cross-part or cross-task evaluation, facilitated by the audio
understanding knowledge acquired during LLM pre-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言大模型在稀疏化（剪枝）下的性能表现，提出了一种名为M-Wanda的剪枝方法，通过语言感知的激活统计动态调整剪枝策略，以最小成本提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型的性能通常依赖于模型规模，而剪枝方法虽能缩小模型规模但往往伴随性能损失。因此，需要研究多语言性与稀疏化之间的权衡。

Method: 提出M-Wanda方法，通过语言感知的激活统计和动态调整层间稀疏度来优化剪枝策略。

Result: M-Wanda在最小额外成本下显著提升了多语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次明确优化剪枝以保留多语言性能，为未来多语言剪枝研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Multilingual LLM performance is often critically dependent on model size.
With an eye on efficiency, this has led to a surge in interest in one-shot
pruning methods that retain the benefits of large-scale pretraining while
shrinking the model size. However, as pruning tends to come with performance
loss, it is important to understand the trade-offs between multilinguality and
sparsification. In this work, we study multilingual performance under different
sparsity constraints and show that moderate ratios already substantially harm
performance. To help bridge this gap, we propose M-Wanda, a pruning method that
models cross-lingual variation by incorporating language-aware activation
statistics into its pruning criterion and dynamically adjusts layerwise
sparsity based on cross-lingual importance. We show that M-Wanda consistently
improves performance at minimal additional costs. We are the first to
explicitly optimize pruning to retain multilingual performance, and hope to
inspire future advances in multilingual pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度推理大语言模型在数学和编码任务中表现优异，但术语翻译这一机器翻译中的关键任务尚未被探索。

Method: 通过词对齐模型提取关键词翻译对，设计三种基于规则的对齐奖励，结合强化学习训练翻译模型。

Result: 实验表明TAT-R1显著提高了术语翻译准确性，同时在通用翻译任务中保持可比性能。

Conclusion: TAT-R1为术语翻译提供了有效解决方案，并通过消融研究揭示了关键发现。

Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning large language models(LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1 have
made significant progress in tasks such as mathematics and coding. Inspired by
this, several studies have employed reinforcement learning(RL) to enhance
models' deep reasoning capabilities and improve machine translation(MT)
quality. However, the terminology translation, an essential task in MT, remains
unexplored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TAT-R1}, a
terminology-aware translation model trained with reinforcement learning and
word alignment. Specifically, we first extract the keyword translation pairs
using a word alignment model. Then we carefully design three types of
rule-based alignment rewards with the extracted alignment relationships. With
those alignment rewards, the RL-trained translation model can learn to focus on
the accurate translation of key information, including terminology in the
source text. Experimental results show the effectiveness of TAT-R1. Our model
significantly improves terminology translation accuracy compared to the
baseline models while maintaining comparable performance on general translation
tasks. In addition, we conduct detailed ablation studies of the
DeepSeek-R1-like training paradigm for machine translation and reveal several
key findings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ConciseR的两阶段强化学习框架，旨在解决大型语言模型在长链式思维推理中的过度思考问题，通过优化生成简洁的推理响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在生成长链式思维推理时存在过度思考现象，表现为冗余或重复的思维模式，影响了推理效率和效果。

Method: 提出两阶段强化学习框架ConciseR：第一阶段通过GRPO++增强推理能力，第二阶段通过L-GRPO强制简洁性。

Result: 实验表明，ConciseR在多个基准测试中优于现有推理模型，生成更简洁的推理响应。

Conclusion: ConciseR有效解决了长链式思维推理中的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率和性能。

Abstract: As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language
Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training
methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward
DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent
overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as
excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage
reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named
ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to
incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy
Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the
second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and
improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization
(L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all
rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run"
principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model,
which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent
state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024,
MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以在不自回归的情况下实现文本重建。

Method: 使用冻结的LLMs，仅提供两个学习嵌入，观察其多标记生成能力。

Result: 发现LLMs具备无需迭代解码的多标记生成能力，且嵌入空间中的表示形成连通局部区域。

Conclusion: 这种能力揭示了LLMs的未开发潜力，并暗示了学习专用编码器的可能性。

Abstract: A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct
surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive
generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we
explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show
that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward
pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising
and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative
decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight
into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that
although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form
connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the
potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

Motivation: 现有放射学报告评估方法局限于单报告场景，且依赖粗糙指标，无法捕捉细粒度临床语义和时间依赖性。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段框架，将生成的报告转换为细粒度、模式对齐的结构化表示，并提出LUNGUAGESCORE评估指标。

Result: LUNGUAGE包含1,473份标注的胸部X光报告和80份纵向标注报告，LUNGUAGESCORE能有效支持结构化报告评估。

Conclusion: LUNGUAGE为序列放射学报告提供了首个基准数据集、结构化框架和评估指标，LUNGUAGESCORE在实证中表现良好。

Abstract: Radiology reports convey detailed clinical observations and capture
diagnostic reasoning that evolves over time. However, existing evaluation
methods are limited to single-report settings and rely on coarse metrics that
fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and temporal dependencies. We
introduce LUNGUAGE,a benchmark dataset for structured radiology report
generation that supports both single-report evaluation and longitudinal
patient-level assessment across multiple studies. It contains 1,473 annotated
chest X-ray reports, each reviewed by experts, and 80 of them contain
longitudinal annotations to capture disease progression and inter-study
intervals, also reviewed by experts. Using this benchmark, we develop a
two-stage framework that transforms generated reports into fine-grained,
schema-aligned structured representations, enabling longitudinal
interpretation. We also propose LUNGUAGESCORE, an interpretable metric that
compares structured outputs at the entity, relation, and attribute level while
modeling temporal consistency across patient timelines. These contributions
establish the first benchmark dataset, structuring framework, and evaluation
metric for sequential radiology reporting, with empirical results demonstrating
that LUNGUAGESCORE effectively supports structured report evaluation. The code

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调如何通过稀疏组件影响LLMs的指令内部化，为可信LLM社区提供了新见解。

Abstract: The finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
their instruction-following capabilities, yet the underlying computational
mechanisms driving these improvements remain poorly understood. This study
systematically examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by
isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components, i.e., neurons
in dense models and both neurons and experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures. In particular, we introduce HexaInst, a carefully curated and
balanced instructional dataset spanning six distinct categories, and propose
SPARCOM, a novel analytical framework comprising three key contributions: (1) a
method for identifying these sparse components, (2) an evaluation of their
functional generality and uniqueness, and (3) a systematic comparison of their
alterations. Through experiments, we demonstrate functional generality,
uniqueness, and the critical role of these components in instruction execution.
By elucidating the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and
sparse computational substrates, this work provides deeper insights into how
LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior for the trustworthy LLM
community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何捕捉不确定性，以解决其生成错误文本（幻觉）的问题。

Method: 将不确定性视为潜在空间中的线性概念，分析LLMs在预训练后捕捉不确定性的能力，并探讨不同类型不确定性的作用。

Result: LLMs能捕捉多种不确定性类型，且统一不确定性类型（如通过指令调整或[IDK]-token调整）有助于提升正确性预测。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效捕捉不确定性，统一不确定性类型可优化其正确性预测能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing
them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models
are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to
emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we study how well
LLMs capture uncertainty, without explicitly being trained for that. We show
that, if considering uncertainty as a linear concept in the model's latent
space, it might indeed be captured, even after only pretraining. We further
show that, though unintuitive, LLMs appear to capture several different types
of uncertainty, each of which can be useful to predict the correctness for a
specific task or benchmark. Furthermore, we provide in-depth results such as
demonstrating a correlation between our correction prediction and the model's
ability to abstain from misinformation using words, and the lack of impact of
model scaling for capturing uncertainty. Finally, we claim that unifying the
uncertainty types as a single one using instruction-tuning or [IDK]-token
tuning is helpful for the model in terms of correctness prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文从模型表示的角度研究机器翻译的鲁棒性，通过分析模型对不合语法输入的内部表示及其在层间的演化，揭示了编码器先检测语法错误再纠正的过程，并提出了“鲁棒性注意力头”的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解鲁棒性对构建可靠的NLP系统至关重要，但以往研究多关注记录鲁棒性失败或改进鲁棒性，缺乏从模型表示角度的深入分析。

Method: 通过语法错误检测（GED）探针和表示相似性分析，研究模型对不合语法输入的内部表示及其演化，并分析注意力机制中的“鲁棒性注意力头”。

Result: 发现编码器先检测语法错误，再通过将表示向正确形式移动来纠正错误；鲁棒性注意力头在响应语法错误时会关注可解释的语言单位。

Conclusion: 模型在鲁棒性微调时更依赖鲁棒性注意力头更新不合语法词的表示，这为理解模型鲁棒性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding robustness is essential for building reliable NLP systems.
Unfortunately, in the context of machine translation, previous work mainly
focused on documenting robustness failures or improving robustness. In
contrast, we study robustness from a model representation perspective by
looking at internal model representations of ungrammatical inputs and how they
evolve through model layers. For this purpose, we perform Grammatical Error
Detection (GED) probing and representational similarity analysis. Our findings
indicate that the encoder first detects the grammatical error, then corrects it
by moving its representation toward the correct form. To understand what
contributes to this process, we turn to the attention mechanism where we
identify what we term Robustness Heads. We find that Robustness Heads attend to
interpretable linguistic units when responding to grammatical errors, and that
when we fine-tune models for robustness, they tend to rely more on Robustness
Heads for updating the ungrammatical word representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型在冷启动场景下表现不佳，而现有NLP方法未能充分结合语义理解和认知分析。

Method: LMCD分两阶段：知识扩散（生成练习和知识概念的丰富内容）和语义-认知融合（结合文本信息和学生认知状态）。

Result: 在两种冷启动场景下，LMCD显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMCD为认知诊断提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，尤其在冷启动场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has become a critical task in AI-empowered
education, supporting personalized learning by accurately assessing students'
cognitive states. However, traditional CD models often struggle in cold-start
scenarios due to the lack of student-exercise interaction data. Recent
NLP-based approaches leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown
promise by utilizing textual features but fail to fully bridge the gap between
semantic understanding and cognitive profiling. In this work, we propose
Language Models as Zeroshot Cognitive Diagnosis Learners (LMCD), a novel
framework designed to handle cold-start challenges by harnessing large language
models (LLMs). LMCD operates via two primary phases: (1) Knowledge Diffusion,
where LLMs generate enriched contents of exercises and knowledge concepts
(KCs), establishing stronger semantic links; and (2) Semantic-Cognitive Fusion,
where LLMs employ causal attention mechanisms to integrate textual information
and student cognitive states, creating comprehensive profiles for both students
and exercises. These representations are efficiently trained with off-the-shelf
CD models. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LMCD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both exercise-cold and
domain-cold settings. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究LLMs在医学文本摘要中的局限性，特别是在高OOV词或高新颖性数据上的表现，并提出词汇适应策略以改进性能。

Method: 通过词汇适应策略（如更新LLM词汇表）和持续预训练策略，在三个医学摘要数据集上进行实验。

Result: 词汇适应显著提升了LLMs在困难场景下的摘要性能，医学专家评估也证实了其生成摘要的相关性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 词汇适应是定制LLMs以适应医学领域的有效方法，尤其在处理专业词汇时表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text
summarization by simply using in-context learning. However, these recent
efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where
LLMs might fail. They typically report performance scores over the entire
dataset. Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant
performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words or with high novelty. Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive
solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets
updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords. An
interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary
size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical
words. To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM
summarization performance even in difficult settings. Through extensive
experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual
pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we
gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for
customizing LLMs to the medical domain. We also performed a human evaluation
study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results
in more relevant and faithful summaries. Our codebase is made publicly
available at https://github.com/gb-kgp/LLM-MedicalSummarization-Benchmark.

Motivation: 多跳问答（MHQA）需要跨文档推理，但现有密集检索器依赖标注数据，而查询的高变异性增加了标注难度。

Method: 提出ReSCORE方法，利用大型语言模型评估文档相关性和一致性，通过迭代问答框架训练检索器。

Result: 在三个MHQA基准测试中，ReSCORE显著提升了检索性能，并达到最先进的问答效果。

Conclusion: ReSCORE为无监督训练密集检索器提供了有效解决方案，推动了MHQA领域的发展。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) involves reasoning across multiple
documents to answer complex questions. Dense retrievers typically outperform
sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings; however, they
require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning. This poses a significant
challenge in MHQA due to the high variability of queries (reformulated)
questions throughout the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a
novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without labeled documents.
ReSCORE leverages large language models to capture each documents relevance to
the question and consistency with the correct answer and use them to train a
retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Experiments on
three MHQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with
significant improvements in retrieval, and in turn, the state-of-the-art MHQA
performance. Our implementation is available at:

Result: PIXEL-M4在语义和句法任务中优于仅英语训练的模型，且能捕捉未见过语言的丰富语言特征。

Conclusion: 多语言预训练显著提升了像素语言模型对多样化语言的支持能力。

Abstract: Pixel language models operate directly on images of rendered text,
eliminating the need for a fixed vocabulary. While these models have
demonstrated strong capabilities for downstream cross-lingual transfer,
multilingual pretraining remains underexplored. We introduce PIXEL-M4, a model
pretrained on four visually and linguistically diverse languages: English,
Hindi, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese. Multilingual evaluations on semantic
and syntactic tasks show that PIXEL-M4 outperforms an English-only counterpart
on non-Latin scripts. Word-level probing analyses confirm that PIXEL-M4
captures rich linguistic features, even in languages not seen during
pretraining. Furthermore, an analysis of its hidden representations shows that
multilingual pretraining yields a semantic embedding space closely aligned
across the languages used for pretraining. This work demonstrates that
multilingual pretraining substantially enhances the capability of pixel
language models to effectively support a diverse set of languages.

Abstract: Advancing code reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally
limited by the scarcity of high-difficulty datasets, especially those with
verifiable input-output test cases necessary for rigorous solution validation
at scale. We introduce rStar-Coder, which significantly improves LLM code
reasoning capabilities by constructing a large-scale, verified dataset of 418K
competition-level code problems, 580K long-reasoning solutions along with rich
test cases of varying difficulty. This is achieved through three core
contributions: (1) we curate competitive programming code problems and oracle
solutions to synthesize new, solvable problems; (2) we introduce a reliable
input-output test case synthesis pipeline that decouples the generation into a
three-step input generation method and a mutual verification mechanism for
effective output labeling; (3) we augment problems with high-quality,
test-case-verified long-reasoning solutions. Extensive experiments on Qwen
models (1.5B-14B) across various code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of rStar-Coder dataset, achieving leading performance comparable to
frontier reasoning LLMs with much smaller model sizes. On LiveCodeBench,
rStar-Coder improves Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to an impressive 57.3%, and
Qwen2.5-14B from 23.3% to 62.5%, surpassing o3-mini (low) by3.1%. On the more
challenging USA Computing Olympiad, our 7B model achieves an average pass@1
accuracy of 16.15%, outperforming the frontier-level QWQ-32B. Code and the

basic (bear), superordinate (animal), and subordinate (grizzly bear). While
prior research has focused on basic-level categories, this study is the first
attempt to examine the organization of categories by analyzing exemplars
produced at the subordinate level. We present a new Italian psycholinguistic
dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words. We then use these
data to evaluate whether textual and vision LLMs produce meaningful exemplars
that align with human category organization across three key tasks: exemplar
generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a
low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies.
However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains.
Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of
using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在NLP系统中代表性不足，可能导致数字鸿沟扩大，因此需要推动相关研究。

Method: 分析了734篇近五年发表的关于非洲语言NLP的研究论文。

Result: 总结了研究进展和关键趋势。

Conclusion: 提出了促进非洲语言NLP研究更具包容性和可持续性的方向。

Abstract: With over 2,000 languages and potentially millions of speakers, Africa
represents one of the richest linguistic regions in the world. Yet, this
diversity is scarcely reflected in state-of-the-art natural language processing
(NLP) systems and large language models (LLMs), which predominantly support a
narrow set of high-resource languages. This exclusion not only limits the reach
and utility of modern NLP technologies but also risks widening the digital
divide across linguistic communities. Nevertheless, NLP research on African
languages is active and growing. In recent years, there has been a surge of
interest in this area, driven by several factors-including the creation of
multilingual language resources, the rise of community-led initiatives, and
increased support through funding programs. In this survey, we analyze 734
research papers on NLP for African languages published over the past five
years, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress across core tasks.
We identify key trends shaping the field and conclude by outlining promising
directions to foster more inclusive and sustainable NLP research for African
languages.

### [121] [Leveraging large language models and traditional machine learning ensembles for ADHD detection from narrative transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21324)
*Yuxin Zhu,Yuting Guo,Noah Marchuck,Abeed Sarker,Yun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种集成框架，结合LLaMA3、RoBERTa和SVM模型，通过多数投票机制提升ADHD诊断分类的鲁棒性，F1分数达到0.71。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）发展迅速，但其与传统监督机器学习在医学数据（尤其是精神病学领域）的结合仍未被充分探索。叙事数据的复杂性和多样性需要多模型结合。

Method: 采用LLaMA3（捕捉长程语义）、RoBERTa（基于临床叙事微调）和SVM（基于TF-IDF特征）三种模型，通过多数投票机制集成。

Result: 集成模型在441个实例（352训练，89验证）上表现优于单一模型，F1分数为0.71（95% CI: [0.60-0.80]），召回率提升且精度保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs的语义丰富性和传统监督ML的可解释性，为精神病学文本分类提供了鲁棒且可推广的新方向。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), their integration
with traditional supervised machine learning (ML) techniques that have proven
applicability to medical data remains underexplored. This is particularly true
for psychiatric applications, where narrative data often exhibit nuanced
linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of
multiple models with differing characteristics. In this study, we introduce an
ensemble framework for automatically classifying
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using
narrative transcripts. Our approach integrates three complementary models:
LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure;
RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical
narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using
TF-IDF-based lexical features. These models are aggregated through a majority
voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness. The dataset includes 441
instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation. Empirical results
show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score
of 0.71 (95\% CI: [0.60-0.80]). Compared to the best-performing individual
model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive
precision. This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying
ADHD-related linguistic cues. These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid
architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the
interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised
ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text
classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PEDANTIC数据集，用于自动检测专利权利要求中的模糊性，并展示了LLM在预测专利明确性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利权利要求中的模糊性是专利申请被拒的常见原因，但目前缺乏相关标注数据集，阻碍了自动检测方法的发展。

Method: 通过自动流程从USPTO获取文件，利用LLM提取模糊性原因，并进行人工验证。采用LLM-as-Judge方法评估模型表现。

Result: LLM在预测专利明确性方面表现不佳，但能正确识别模糊性原因。PEDANTIC数据集为专利AI研究提供了资源。

Conclusion: PEDANTIC数据集填补了专利明确性检测领域的空白，为未来研究提供了基础，但LLM仍需改进。

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are
ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is
referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most
frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic
methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent
drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been
published to date.
  We introduce PEDANTIC (\underline{P}at\underline{e}nt
\underline{D}efiniteness Ex\underline{a}mi\underline{n}a\underline{ti}on
\underline{C}orpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent
applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with
reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic
pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human
validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality
annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement
an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every
model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents
based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression
baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify
the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI
researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will
publicly release the dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SOMADHAN数据集，用于解决孟加拉语数学应用题（MWPs）的挑战，并通过多种大语言模型（LLMs）评估其性能，发现Chain of Thought（CoT）提示显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决孟加拉语数学应用题在自然语言处理中的挑战，填补该语言低资源环境下缺乏高质量数据集的空白。

Method: 创建SOMADHAN数据集（8792道复杂MWPs），评估多种LLMs（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）在零样本和少样本下的表现，结合CoT提示和LoRA微调。

Result: LLaMA-3.3 70B在少样本CoT提示下达到88%的最高准确率，CoT提示在多步逻辑任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究填补了孟加拉语NLP的空白，提供了高质量数据集和可扩展框架，推动低资源语言研究和教育技术发展。

Abstract: Solving Bengali Math Word Problems (MWPs) remains a major challenge in
natural language processing (NLP) due to the language's low-resource status and
the multi-step reasoning required. Existing models struggle with complex
Bengali MWPs, largely because no human-annotated Bengali dataset has previously
addressed this task. This gap has limited progress in Bengali mathematical
reasoning. To address this, we created SOMADHAN, a dataset of 8792 complex
Bengali MWPs with manually written, step-by-step solutions. We designed this
dataset to support reasoning-focused evaluation and model development in a
linguistically underrepresented context. Using SOMADHAN, we evaluated a range
of large language models (LLMs) - including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA series
models, Deepseek, and Qwen - through both zero-shot and few-shot prompting with
and without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT prompting consistently
improved performance over standard prompting, especially in tasks requiring
multi-step logic. LLaMA-3.3 70B achieved the highest accuracy of 88% with
few-shot CoT prompting. We also applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune
models efficiently, enabling them to adapt to Bengali MWPs with minimal
computational cost. Our work fills a critical gap in Bengali NLP by providing a
high-quality reasoning dataset and a scalable framework for solving complex
MWPs. We aim to advance equitable research in low-resource languages and
enhance reasoning capabilities in educational and language technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大语言模型（LLM）在用户社会人口特征（如年龄、职业、教育水平）下行为适应性的框架，并比较了显式（用户资料）和隐式（多轮对话历史）两种方式的模型行为一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注单轮提示，而实际应用中需结合对话历史，因此需研究LLM在多轮对话中对社会人口特征的适应性。

Method: 通过多智能体流程构建合成数据集，结合用户资料和对话历史，使用VSM 2013问题探测模型的价值表达。

Result: 多数模型会根据人口特征调整表达，尤其在年龄和教育水平上，但一致性不一；推理能力强的模型表现更一致。

Conclusion: 推理能力对LLM的社会人口特征适应性至关重要。

Abstract: Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting
responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation,
and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue
history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral
adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a
framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1)
explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn
dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these
modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset
pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions
from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe
value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed
values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education
level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities
demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust
sociodemographic adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在性别角色名词修订中的表现是否符合现代语言改革（女权主义和跨性别包容），并探讨其上下文敏感性。

Method: 通过分析LLM对性别角色名词的修订及其理由，结合社会语言学视角，评估其与语言改革的契合度及上下文敏感性。

Result: 研究发现LLM在性别角色名词修订中表现出与人类相似的上下文敏感性，且部分符合女权主义和跨性别包容的语言改革。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM在语言修订中的潜力与挑战，为价值对齐提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Within the common LLM use case of text revision, we study LLMs' revision of
gendered role nouns (e.g., outdoorsperson/woman/man) and their justifications
of such revisions. We evaluate their alignment with feminist and
trans-inclusive language reforms for English. Drawing on insight from
sociolinguistics, we further assess if LLMs are sensitive to the same
contextual effects in the application of such reforms as people are, finding
broad evidence of such effects. We discuss implications for value alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意用户利用语音替换规避仇恨言论检测，而现有研究忽略了韩语的特点且多集中于数据集构建而非架构防御。

Method: 提出PHISH方法利用韩语语音特性，以及MESH方法在架构层面结合语义和语音特征以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验证明方法在扰动和非扰动数据集上均有效，提升了检测性能并反映了真实的对抗行为。

Conclusion: PHISH和MESH不仅填补了韩语研究的空白，还为检测器的架构防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: As malicious users increasingly employ phonetic substitution to evade hate
speech detection, researchers have investigated such strategies. However, two
key challenges remain. First, existing studies have overlooked the Korean
language, despite its vulnerability to phonetic perturbations due to its
phonographic nature. Second, prior work has primarily focused on constructing
datasets rather than developing architectural defenses. To address these
challenges, we propose (1) PHonetic-Informed Substitution for Hangul (PHISH)
that exploits the phonological characteristics of the Korean writing system,
and (2) Mixed Encoding of Semantic-pHonetic features (MESH) that enhances the
detector's robustness by incorporating phonetic information at the
architectural level. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods on both perturbed and unperturbed datasets, suggesting
that they not only improve detection performance but also reflect realistic
adversarial behaviors employed by malicious users.

TL;DR: AutoJudger是一个基于代理的框架，通过动态选择测试问题和估计问题难度，显著降低多模态大语言模型评估的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型评估成本高昂，需要高效且自适应的解决方案。

Method: 采用项目反应理论（IRT）估计问题难度，结合语义感知检索和动态记忆机制，动态选择最具信息量的测试问题。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试中，AutoJudger仅使用4%的数据即可达到90%以上的排名准确性。

Conclusion: AutoJudger有效降低了评估成本，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is increasingly
expensive, as the growing size and cross-modality complexity of benchmarks
demand significant scoring efforts. To tackle with this difficulty, we
introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive
benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the
Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an
autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test
questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger
incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to
ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across
both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains
contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and
globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process.
Extensive experiments on four representative multimodal benchmarks demonstrate
that our adaptive framework dramatically reduces evaluation expenses, i.e.
AutoJudger uses only 4% of the data to achieve over 90% ranking accuracy with
the full benchmark evaluation on MMT-Bench.

Result: 元数据提升可行性20%，自动验证提升质量7%，人类研究显示生成想法能激发更高质量的研究提案。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的研究想法生成具有潜力，大语言模型辅助在实际学术场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating novel research ideas. However, these ideas often face challenges
related to feasibility and expected effectiveness. This paper explores how
augmenting LLMs with relevant data during the idea generation process can
enhance the quality of generated ideas. We introduce two ways of incorporating
data: (1) providing metadata during the idea generation stage to guide LLMs
toward feasible directions, and (2) adding automatic validation during the idea
selection stage to assess the empirical plausibility of hypotheses within
ideas. We conduct experiments in the social science domain, specifically with
climate negotiation topics, and find that metadata improves the feasibility of
generated ideas by 20%, while automatic validation improves the overall quality
of selected ideas by 7%. A human study shows that LLM-generated ideas, along
with their related data and validation processes, inspire researchers to
propose research ideas with higher quality. Our work highlights the potential
of data-driven research idea generation, and underscores the practical utility
of LLM-assisted ideation in real-world academic settings.

TL;DR: DecisionFlow是一个新的决策建模框架，通过结构化表示和潜在效用函数提升语言模型的透明性和可解释性，在高风险领域表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗和金融），决策需要透明和可解释的推理，但现有语言模型缺乏结构化思考能力。

Method: 提出DecisionFlow框架，构建语义基础决策空间，推断潜在效用函数，以透明方式评估权衡。

Result: 在两个高风险基准测试中，DecisionFlow比基线方法准确率提升30%，并增强结果一致性。

Conclusion: DecisionFlow结合符号推理与LLM，为更可靠、可解释的决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, effective
decision-making demands not just accurate outcomes but transparent and
explainable reasoning. However, current language models often lack the
structured deliberation needed for such tasks, instead generating decisions and
justifications in a disconnected, post-hoc manner. To address this, we propose
DecisionFlow, a novel decision modeling framework that guides models to reason
over structured representations of actions, attributes, and constraints. Rather
than predicting answers directly from prompts, DecisionFlow builds a
semantically grounded decision space and infers a latent utility function to
evaluate trade-offs in a transparent, utility-driven manner. This process
produces decisions tightly coupled with interpretable rationales reflecting the
model's reasoning. Empirical results on two high-stakes benchmarks show that
DecisionFlow not only achieves up to 30% accuracy gains over strong prompting
baselines but also enhances alignment in outcomes. Our work is a critical step
toward integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, enabling more accountable,
explainable, and reliable LLM decision support systems. We release the data and
code at https://github.com/xiusic/DecisionFlow.

Motivation: 解决生成内容中事实错误的问题，探索LLM内在的自我监测机制。

Method: 通过分析Transformer残差流中的线性特征，研究LLM对实体-关系-属性三元组正确性的判断能力，并测试上下文扰动的影响。

Result: LLM在训练中快速形成自我监测能力，中间层的表现最佳，且对格式变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM具有内在的自我监测能力，有助于提升其可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Factual incorrectness in generated content is one of the primary concerns in
ubiquitous deployment of large language models (LLMs). Prior findings suggest
LLMs can (sometimes) detect factual incorrectness in their generated content
(i.e., fact-checking post-generation). In this work, we provide evidence
supporting the presence of LLMs' internal compass that dictate the correctness
of factual recall at the time of generation. We demonstrate that for a given
subject entity and a relation, LLMs internally encode linear features in the
Transformer's residual stream that dictate whether it will be able to recall
the correct attribute (that forms a valid entity-relation-attribute triplet).
This self-awareness signal is robust to minor formatting variations. We
investigate the effects of context perturbation via different example selection
strategies. Scaling experiments across model sizes and training dynamics
highlight that self-awareness emerges rapidly during training and peaks in
intermediate layers. These findings uncover intrinsic self-monitoring
capabilities within LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and
reliability.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在生成结构化、多记录表格输出时的准确性挑战，并提出了新基准RelationalFactQA。实验显示，即使是最先进的LLMs，其准确性也不超过25%，且性能随输出维度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注简短事实回答，忽视了生成结构化表格输出的能力，而这种能力在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 引入RelationalFactQA基准，包含多样化的自然语言问题（与SQL配对）和标准表格答案，用于评估结构化知识检索能力。

Result: 实验表明，即使LLMs知道单个事实，生成关系型输出的准确性仍显著低于25%，且性能随输出维度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在合成结构化事实知识方面存在显著局限，RelationalFactQA为未来LLM事实性研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a persistent challenge. Current
benchmarks often assess short factual answers, overlooking the critical ability
to generate structured, multi-record tabular outputs from parametric knowledge.
We demonstrate that this relational fact retrieval is substantially more
difficult than isolated point-wise queries, even when individual facts are
known to the model, exposing distinct failure modes sensitive to output
dimensionality (e.g., number of attributes or records). To systematically
evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new
benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and
gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge
retrieval in a structured format. RelationalFactQA enables analysis across
varying query complexities, output sizes, and data characteristics. Our
experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly, not
exceeding 25% factual accuracy in generating relational outputs, with
performance notably degrading as output dimensionality increases. These
findings underscore critical limitations in current LLMs' ability to synthesize
structured factual knowledge and establish RelationalFactQA as a crucial
resource for measuring future progress in LLM factuality.

TL;DR: MoGE（Mixture of Grouped Experts）通过分组专家并平衡负载，解决了MoE中专家激活不均衡的问题，显著提升了模型在Ascend NPU上的训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型中专家激活不均衡导致系统效率低下，尤其是在多设备并行运行时。

Method: 提出MoGE，通过预定义专家分组并约束每个组内专家的激活数量，实现负载均衡。

Result: MoGE显著提升了专家负载均衡和计算效率，Pangu Pro MoE在Ascend NPU上表现出色，推理性能优于同类密集模型。

Conclusion: MoGE是一种高效的专家分组方法，适用于大规模稀疏模型的训练和推理，尤其在Ascend NPU上表现优异。

Abstract: The surgence of Mixture of Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models promises a
small price of execution cost for a much larger model parameter count and
learning capacity, because only a small fraction of parameters are activated
for each input token. However, it is commonly observed that some experts are
activated far more often than others, leading to system inefficiency when
running the experts on different devices in parallel. Therefore, we introduce
Mixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE), which groups the experts during selection
and balances the expert workload better than MoE in nature. It constrains
tokens to activate an equal number of experts within each predefined expert
group. When a model execution is distributed on multiple devices, this
architectural design ensures a balanced computational load across devices,
significantly enhancing throughput, particularly for the inference phase.
Further, we build Pangu Pro MoE on Ascend NPUs, a sparse model based on MoGE
with 72 billion total parameters, 16 billion of which are activated for each
token. The configuration of Pangu Pro MoE is optimized for Ascend 300I Duo and
800I A2 through extensive system simulation studies. Our experiments indicate
that MoGE indeed leads to better expert load balancing and more efficient
execution for both model training and inference on Ascend NPUs. The inference
performance of Pangu Pro MoE achieves 1148 tokens/s per card and can be further
improved to 1528 tokens/s per card by speculative acceleration, outperforming
comparable 32B and 72B Dense models. Furthermore, we achieve an excellent
cost-to-performance ratio for model inference on Ascend 300I Duo.Our studies
show that Ascend NPUs are capable of training Pangu Pro MoE with massive
parallelization to make it a leading model within the sub-100B total parameter
class, outperforming prominent open-source models like GLM-Z1-32B and
Qwen3-32B.

TL;DR: RefTool是一个参考引导的框架，通过外部结构化材料（如教科书）自动创建工具，解决了LLMs在缺乏预定义工具时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLMs的内部知识，无法处理超出其知识范围的任务。RefTool通过利用外部参考材料，克服了这一限制。

Method: RefTool包含两个模块：工具创建（从参考内容生成、验证并组织工具）和工具利用（选择并应用工具解决问题）。

Result: 在因果、物理和化学基准测试中，RefTool平均准确率提升11.3%，且成本高效、通用性强。

Conclusion: RefTool通过外部参考材料提升工具创建的准确性和通用性，为LLMs的推理能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: Tools enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex problem-solving tasks, but not all tasks have available tools. In the
absence of predefined tools, prior works have explored instructing LLMs to
generate tools on their own. However, such approaches rely heavily on the
models' internal knowledge and would fail in domains beyond the LLMs' knowledge
scope. To address this limitation, we propose RefTool, a reference-guided
framework for automatic tool creation that leverages structured external
materials such as textbooks. RefTool consists of two modules: (1) tool
creation, where LLMs generate executable tools from reference content, validate
them using illustrative examples, and organize them hierarchically into a
toolbox; and (2) tool utilization, where LLMs navigate the toolbox structure to
select and apply the appropriate tools to solve problems. Experiments on
causality, physics, and chemistry benchmarks demonstrate that RefTool
outperforms existing tool-creation and domain-specific reasoning methods by
11.3% on average accuracy, while being cost-efficient and broadly
generalizable. Analyses reveal that grounding tool creation in references
produces accurate and faithful tools, and that the hierarchical structure
facilitates effective tool selection. RefTool enables LLMs to overcome
knowledge limitations, demonstrating the value of grounding tool creation in
external references for enhanced and generalizable reasoning.

*Yuchen Zhuang,Aaron Trinh,Rushi Qiang,Haotian Sun,Chao Zhang,Hanjun Dai,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InF-IR是一个专为提升检索模型在指令跟随信息检索（IR）中表现的大规模高质量训练语料库，包含38,000个<指令,查询,段落>三元组，并生成硬负样本。基于此训练的InF-Embed模型在指令跟随能力上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IR模型难以有效理解和遵循显式用户指令，需要专门的数据集和模型来提升指令跟随能力。

Method: 构建InF-IR语料库，包含正样本和通过污染指令和查询生成的硬负样本，训练InF-Embed模型，采用对比学习和指令-查询注意力机制。

Result: InF-Embed在五个指令检索基准测试中，p-MRR指标显著优于基线8.1%。

Conclusion: InF-IR语料库和InF-Embed模型有效提升了指令跟随检索能力，为IR领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) models, trained exclusively on standard
<query, passage> pairs, struggle to effectively interpret and follow explicit
user instructions. We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training
corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR.
InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive
<instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for
each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by
poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an
advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while
maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily
support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language
models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further
enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models,
facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train
InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive
learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes
precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five
instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly
surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the
instruction-following capabilities.

*Jocelyn Shen,Akhila Yerukola,Xuhui Zhou,Cynthia Breazeal,Maarten Sap,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了亲密关系中对话破裂的检测，强调现有NLP研究忽视了关系动态的影响，并利用非暴力沟通理论评估LLMs在此任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP研究将冲突检测视为通用任务，忽略了个人历史和情感背景对对话感知的影响。

Method: 通过构建PersonaConflicts Corpus数据集（5,772条模拟对话），结合人类标注研究，评估关系背景对人类和模型冲突感知的影响。

Result: 关系背景的极性显著影响人类对对话破裂的感知，但模型难以有效利用这些背景信息，且高估了消息对听众的积极影响。

Conclusion: 个性化关系背景对LLMs在人类沟通中作为有效调解者至关重要。

Abstract: Conversational breakdowns in close relationships are deeply shaped by
personal histories and emotional context, yet most NLP research treats conflict
detection as a general task, overlooking the relational dynamics that influence
how messages are perceived. In this work, we leverage nonviolent communication
(NVC) theory to evaluate LLMs in detecting conversational breakdowns and
assessing how relationship backstory influences both human and model perception
of conflicts. Given the sensitivity and scarcity of real-world datasets
featuring conflict between familiar social partners with rich personal
backstories, we contribute the PersonaConflicts Corpus, a dataset of N=5,772
naturalistic simulated dialogues spanning diverse conflict scenarios between
friends, family members, and romantic partners. Through a controlled human
study, we annotate a subset of dialogues and obtain fine-grained labels of
communication breakdown types on individual turns, and assess the impact of
backstory on human and model perception of conflict in conversation. We find
that the polarity of relationship backstories significantly shifted human
perception of communication breakdowns and impressions of the social partners,
yet models struggle to meaningfully leverage those backstories in the detection
task. Additionally, we find that models consistently overestimate how
positively a message will make a listener feel. Our findings underscore the
critical role of personalization to relationship contexts in enabling LLMs to
serve as effective mediators in human communication for authentic connection.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的潜在语言与输入输出语言的不一致性并不总是影响下游任务性能，因为模型会在最终层调整内部表示以适应目标语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨潜在语言与输入输出语言的不一致性如何影响下游任务性能，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过在不同下游任务中变化输入提示语言，分析潜在语言一致性与任务性能的相关性，并构建包含翻译和地理文化问题的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，潜在语言一致性并非总是对下游任务性能至关重要，因为模型会在最终层调整内部表示以适应目标语言。

Conclusion: 潜在语言一致性对下游任务性能的影响有限，模型能够通过调整内部表示来适应任务需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to process information using a
proficient internal language consistently, referred to as latent language,
which may differ from the input or output languages. However, how the
discrepancy between the latent language and the input and output language
affects downstream task performance remains largely unexplored. While many
studies research the latent language of LLMs, few address its importance in
influencing task performance. In our study, we hypothesize that thinking in
latent language consistently enhances downstream task performance. To validate
this, our work varies the input prompt languages across multiple downstream
tasks and analyzes the correlation between consistency in latent language and
task performance. We create datasets consisting of questions from diverse
domains such as translation and geo-culture, which are influenced by the choice
of latent language. Experimental results across multiple LLMs on translation
and geo-culture tasks, which are sensitive to the choice of language, indicate
that maintaining consistency in latent language is not always necessary for
optimal downstream task performance. This is because these models adapt their
internal representations near the final layers to match the target language,
reducing the impact of consistency on overall performance.

### [137] [Accelerating Diffusion Language Model Inference via Efficient KV Caching and Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21467)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种无需训练的技术（FreeCache和Guided Diffusion），显著提升了扩散语言模型的推理效率，使其在保持质量的同时实现34倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型虽具有并行生成和双向性优势，但存在推理速度慢、计算成本高以及并行生成导致的token不连贯问题。

Method: 1. FreeCache：通过重用稳定的KV投影减少计算成本；2. Guided Diffusion：利用轻量级自回归模型监督token生成，减少去噪迭代次数。

Result: 在开源推理基准测试中，组合方法实现34倍端到端加速，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 首次使扩散语言模型在延迟上与自回归模型相当甚至更快，为其广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent
bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling
compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion
models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match
the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,
Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward
passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for
long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token
generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling
heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising
steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,
we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that
reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the
computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a
training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to
supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising
iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on
open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x
end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy. For the first time, diffusion
language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely
adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling
up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across
different domains.

### [138] [Scaling External Knowledge Input Beyond Context Windows of LLMs via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21471)
*Zijun Liu,Zhennan Wan,Peng Li,Ming Yan,Ji Zhang,Fei Huang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体框架ExtAgents，用于解决大语言模型（LLM）在推理和信息检索任务中因上下文窗口限制导致的知识输入不足问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文窗口扩展方法会导致信息丢失，而多智能体方法在知识同步和推理过程中存在瓶颈，限制了大规模外部知识的整合。

Method: 开发了ExtAgents框架，通过多智能体分布式处理大规模输入，避免了长上下文训练的需求。

Result: 在增强的多跳问答测试∞Bench+和其他公共测试集上，ExtAgents显著优于现有非训练方法，且保持高效并行性。

Conclusion: ExtAgents为无需长上下文训练的知识整合提供了可扩展解决方案，未来研究可进一步优化智能体协调以支持实际应用。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and
information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large
quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited
context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge
input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring
significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension
methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge
as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we
identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and
reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework,
$\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability
in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training.
Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test,
$\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including
long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over
existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input,
regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$.
Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further
study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input
could benefit real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在道德推理中的表现，揭示了其倾向于义务论原则，而后解释则转向功利主义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在医疗、法律和治理中的应用增加，理解其如何处理道德复杂场景变得至关重要。

Method: 研究利用600多个电车问题作为探针，引入并测试了基于义务论和功利主义的道德分类法。

Result: 分析显示，LLMs的推理链倾向于义务论，而后解释则转向功利主义。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解LLMs如何处理道德问题提供了基础，有助于其在高风险决策环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and
governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes
critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large
language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process.
In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces
provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw
inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600
distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that
emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral
rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main
normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis
reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based
on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward
consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a
foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical
considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of
LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: UI-Genie是一个自改进框架，解决了GUI代理中的两个关键问题：轨迹结果验证困难和高质量训练数据不可扩展。通过奖励模型和自我改进流程分别解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理中的轨迹验证和高质量训练数据的缺乏是主要挑战。

Method: 采用图像-文本交错架构的奖励模型（UI-Genie-RM）和自我改进流程，结合数据生成策略如规则验证和硬负样本挖掘。

Result: UI-Genie在多个GUI代理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并通过三阶段数据-模型自改进验证。

Conclusion: UI-Genie框架和数据集开源，为GUI代理研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing
two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is
challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges
are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively.
The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture
that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and
task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop
deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based
verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To
address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands
solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models
through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic
environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and
UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI
agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration
without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three
generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete
framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Catfish Agent的新概念，旨在通过结构化异议解决多智能体框架中的Silent Agreement问题，提升临床问答的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架在临床问答中虽表现优异，但存在Silent Agreement问题，即智能体过早达成共识而缺乏批判性分析，尤其在复杂或模糊病例中。

Method: 引入Catfish Agent，通过两种机制（复杂性感知干预和语气校准干预）注入结构化异议，刺激更深层次的推理。

Result: 在九个医学Q&A和三个医学VQA基准测试中，该方法显著优于单智能体和多智能体框架，包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1等领先商业模型。

Conclusion: Catfish Agent通过有效干预Silent Agreement问题，显著提升了多智能体框架在临床问答中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.

Motivation: 研究多语言对齐如何通过神经元机制提升LLMs的多语言能力，并揭示语言特定神经元的作用。

Method: 提出新的神经元识别算法，分析神经元分布特性，并将多语言推理过程分为四个部分。

Result: 系统分析了对齐前后的模型，揭示了“自发多语言对齐”现象，提供了实证结果和见解。

Conclusion: 通过神经元类型的综合分析，为理解LLMs的多语言对齐和能力提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance
LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the
high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some
researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific
neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different
languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs'
mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we
propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects
language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related
neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the
distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the
LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1)
multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3)
multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting.
Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment
with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of
''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a
comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing
empirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual
alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: As a global disease, infertility has always affected human beings. The
development of assisted reproductive technology can effectively solve this

technology still faces many challenges in improving the success rate of
pregnancy, such as the subjectivity of embryo grading and the inefficiency of

static images, time-lapse videos and structured table data) from a new
perspective, and discusses the main challenges in current research, such as the
complexity of multi-modal information fusion and data scarcity.

Result: 在包含729篇论文的新基准测试中，Manalyzer在多任务元分析中显著优于LLM基线。

Conclusion: Manalyzer通过多智能体系统实现了高效的自动化元分析，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Meta-analysis is a systematic research methodology that synthesizes data from
multiple existing studies to derive comprehensive conclusions. This approach
not only mitigates limitations inherent in individual studies but also
facilitates novel discoveries through integrated data analysis. Traditional
meta-analysis involves a complex multi-stage pipeline including literature
retrieval, paper screening, and data extraction, which demands substantial
human effort and time. However, while LLM-based methods can accelerate certain
stages, they still face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in paper
screening and data extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system,
Manalyzer, which achieves end-to-end automated meta-analysis through tool
calls. The hybrid review, hierarchical extraction, self-proving, and feedback
checking strategies implemented in Manalyzer significantly alleviate these two
hallucinations. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of meta-analysis,
we construct a new benchmark comprising 729 papers across 3 domains,
encompassing text, image, and table modalities, with over 10,000 data points.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Manalyzer achieves significant
performance improvements over the LLM baseline in multi meta-analysis tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge representation and reasoning in neural networks have been a
long-standing endeavor which has attracted much attention recently. The
principled integration of reasoning and learning in neural networks is a main
objective of the area of neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this
chapter, a simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system is described that can
represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula. This
creates a powerful combination of learning from data and knowledge and logical
reasoning. We start by positioning neurosymbolic AI in the context of the
current AI landscape that is unsurprisingly dominated by Large Language Models
(LLMs). We identify important challenges of data efficiency, fairness and
safety of LLMs that might be addressed by neurosymbolic reasoning systems with
formal reasoning capabilities. We then discuss the representation of logic by
the specific energy-based system, including illustrative examples and empirical
evaluation of the correspondence between logical reasoning and energy
minimization using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Learning from data and
knowledge is also evaluated empirically and compared with a symbolic, neural
and a neurosymbolic system. Results reported in this chapter in an accessible
way are expected to reignite the research on the use of neural networks as
massively-parallel models for logical reasoning and promote the principled
integration of reasoning and learning in deep networks. We conclude the chapter
with a discussion of the importance of positioning neurosymbolic AI within a
broader framework of formal reasoning and accountability in AI, discussing the
challenges for neurosynbolic AI to tackle the various known problems of
reliability of deep learning.

Result: 在信息检索和推荐系统任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实验上均表现出优越性，适用于排序系统的低延迟需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in ranking systems such
as information retrieval (IR) systems and recommender systems (RSs). To
alleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the
single (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from
severe degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD)
methods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face
challenges in ranking systems due to their left-to-right decoding paradigm.
Firstly, ranking systems require strict latency constraints, but verification
rounds in SD methods remain agnostic; Secondly, SD methods usually discard
listwise ranking knowledge about unaccepted items in previous rounds, hindering
future multi-token prediction, especially when candidate tokens are the
unaccepted items. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Speculative
Decoding method for fast ranking inference of LLMs. To meet the ranking
systems' latency requirement, we propose an up-to-down decoding paradigm that
employs an agent to iteratively modify the ranking sequence under a constrained
budget. Specifically, we design a ranking-tailored policy optimization,
actively exploring optimal multi-round ranking modification policy verified by
LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To better approximate the target LLM
under the constrained budget, we trigger the agent fully utilizing the listwise
ranking knowledge about all items verified by LLMs across different rounds in
RL, enhancing the modification policy of the agent. More importantly, we
demonstrate the theoretical robustness and advantages of our paradigm and
implementation. Experiments on both IR and RS tasks show the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

description of EUCogII, the project for the European Network for Cognitive
Systems within which this formulation of the 'challenges' was originally
developed (http://www.eucognition.org). So, we stick out our neck and formulate
the challenges for artificial cognitive systems. These challenges are
articulated in terms of a definition of what a cognitive system is: a system
that learns from experience and uses its acquired knowledge (both declarative
and practical) in a flexible manner to achieve its own goals.

Abstract: Value learning is a crucial aspect of safe and ethical AI. This is primarily
pursued by methods inferring human values from behaviour. However, humans care
about much more than we are able to demonstrate through our actions.
Consequently, an AI must predict the rest of our seemingly complex values from
a limited sample. I call this the value generalization problem. In this paper,
I argue that human values have a generative rational structure and that this
allows us to solve the value generalization problem. In particular, we can use
Bayesian Theory of Mind models to infer human values not only from behaviour,
but also from other values. This has been obscured by the widespread use of
simple utility functions to represent human values. I conclude that developing
generative value-to-value inference is a crucial component of achieving a
scalable machine theory of mind.

*Meng Cao,Shuyuan Zhang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Doina Precup*

TL;DR: SCAR利用Shapley值分配序列级奖励，解决了RLHF中稀疏奖励信号的问题，无需额外训练或精细标注，显著提升了模型对齐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF在大型语言模型对齐中常用，但稀疏奖励信号导致信用分配困难，SCAR旨在提供密集且公平的奖励信号。

Method: 提出SCAR方法，基于Shapley值将序列级奖励分配给各token或文本片段，无需辅助模型或中间标注。

Result: SCAR在多项任务中表现优于标准RLHF和注意力密集奖励基线，收敛更快且最终奖励更高。

Conclusion: SCAR为RLHF提供了更高效且理论可靠的信用分配方法，显著提升模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique
for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often
suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment
challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score
for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or
span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we
propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages
Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total
sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their
principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals,
crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or
recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages.
Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for
fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the
original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including
sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that
SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores
compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our
findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound
method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of
LLMs.

Result: 框架为构建支持假设生成和理论开发的智能显微镜系统提供了路线图。

Conclusion: 智能显微镜重新定义了科学仪器在知识创造中的角色，从自动化工具升级为主动合作伙伴。

Abstract: Smart microscopy represents a paradigm shift in biological imaging, moving
from passive observation tools to active collaborators in scientific inquiry.
Enabled by advances in automation, computational power, and artificial
intelligence, these systems are now capable of adaptive decision-making and
real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that
reconceptualizes smart microscopy as a partner in scientific investigation.
Central to our framework is the concept of the 'epistemic-empirical divide' in
cellular investigation-the gap between what is observable (empirical domain)
and what must be understood (epistemic domain). We propose six core design
principles: epistemic-empirical awareness, hierarchical context integration, an
evolution from detection to perception, adaptive measurement frameworks,
narrative synthesis capabilities, and cross-contextual reasoning. Together,
these principles guide a multi-agent architecture designed to align empirical
observation with the goals of scientific understanding. Our framework provides
a roadmap for building microscopy systems that go beyond automation to actively
support hypothesis generation, insight discovery, and theory development,
redefining the role of scientific instruments in the process of knowledge
creation.

Conclusion: Project Riley展示了情感代理在对话AI中的潜力，未来可扩展至更复杂场景，如紧急信息传递（如Armando原型）。

Abstract: This paper presents Project Riley, a novel multimodal and multi-model
conversational AI architecture oriented towards the simulation of reasoning
influenced by emotional states. Drawing inspiration from Pixar's Inside Out,
the system comprises five distinct emotional agents - Joy, Sadness, Fear,
Anger, and Disgust - that engage in structured multi-round dialogues to
generate, criticise, and iteratively refine responses. A final reasoning
mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output
that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives.
The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models
(LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A
functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised
for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial
prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in
emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate
information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through
user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a
structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness,
Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness. The results indicate
strong performance in structured scenarios, particularly with respect to
emotional alignment and communicative clarity.

Conclusion: 本文为测试时扩展的成本效益权衡提供了理论指导，有助于开发更高效的推理策略。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited the capacity of enhancing
reasoning performance via internal test-time scaling. Building upon this, a
promising direction is to further scale test-time compute to unlock even
greater reasoning capabilities. However, as we push these scaling boundaries,
systematically understanding the practical limits and achieving optimal
resource allocation becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate
the scaling Pareto of test-time scaling and introduce the Test-Time Scaling
Performance Model (TTSPM). We theoretically analyze two fundamental paradigms
for such extended scaling, parallel scaling and sequential scaling, from a
probabilistic modeling perspective. Our primary contribution is the derivation
of the saturation point on the scaling budget for both strategies, identifying
thresholds beyond which additional computation yields diminishing returns.
Remarkably, despite their distinct mechanisms, both paradigms converge to a
unified mathematical structure in their upper bounds. We empirically validate
our theoretical findings on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH-500, and GPQA, demonstrating the practical utility of these bounds for
test-time resource allocation. We hope that this work provides insights into
the cost-benefit trade-offs of test-time scaling, guiding the development of
more resource-efficient inference strategies for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Objective To develop an LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI
interface and performed a clinical trial comparing this interface and
physicians for common internal medicine cases based on the United States
Medical License Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skill (CS) style exams. Methods A
nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on August 20, 2024. We recruited one
general physician, two internal medicine residents (2nd and 3rd year), and five
simulated patients. The clinical vignettes were adapted from the USMLE Step 2
CS style exams. We developed 10 representative internal medicine cases based on
actual patients and included information available on initial diagnostic
evaluation. Primary outcome was the accuracy of the first differential
diagnosis. Repeatability was evaluated based on the proportion of agreement.
Results The accuracy of the physicians' first differential diagnosis ranged
from 50% to 70%, whereas the realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface
achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first
differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second
differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI
interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI
interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec).
The AI interface ($0.08) also reduced costs by 98.1% compared to the
physicians' average ($4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3
for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM
based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface demonstrated diagnostic
accuracy and patient satisfaction comparable to those of a physician, while
requiring less time and lower costs. These findings suggest that AI interfaces
may have the potential to assist primary care consultations for common internal
medicine cases.

Method: 设计CoderAgent，基于ACT-R认知架构框架，模拟学生编程过程，引入编程思维树（PTOT）分解问题解决步骤（why, how, where, what）。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，CoderAgent能提供可解释的学习轨迹分析并实现准确模拟。

Conclusion: CoderAgent为个性化编程教育提供了新途径，通过细粒度模拟和认知架构设计填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Personalized programming tutoring, such as exercise recommendation, can
enhance learners' efficiency, motivation, and outcomes, which is increasingly
important in modern digital education. However, the lack of sufficient and
high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline
evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such
systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner
practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of
programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity.
To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate
students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on
real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent,
the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human
programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture
framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive
architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the
application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in
multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought
(PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and
what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving
strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning
trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized
programming education.

Result: AutoReproduce在五个评估指标上均优于基线，峰值提升70%。

Conclusion: AutoReproduce显著提升了实验复现的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient experiment reproduction is critical to accelerating progress in
artificial intelligence. However, the inherent complexity of method design and
training procedures presents substantial challenges for automation. Notably,
reproducing experiments often requires implicit domain-specific knowledge not
explicitly documented in the original papers. To address this, we introduce the
paper lineage algorithm, which identifies and extracts implicit knowledge from
the relevant references cited by the target paper. Building on this idea, we
propose AutoReproduce, a multi-agent framework capable of automatically
reproducing experiments described in research papers in an end-to-end manner.
AutoReproduce enhances code executability by generating unit tests alongside
the reproduction process. To evaluate the reproduction capability, we construct
ReproduceBench, a benchmark annotated with verified implementations, and
introduce novel evaluation metrics to assess both the reproduction and
execution fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoReproduce
outperforms the existing strong agent baselines on all five evaluation metrics
by a peak margin of over $70\%$. In particular, compared to the official
implementations, AutoReproduce achieves an average performance gap of $22.1\%$
on $89.74\%$ of the executable experiment runs. The code will be available at

Result: 在StableToolBench和TravelPlanner基准测试中，MIRROR表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MIRROR通过系统性反思显著提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现，为多智能体工作流提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex tasks involving tool integration pose significant challenges for
Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the emergence of multi-agent workflows
as a promising solution. Reflection has emerged as an effective strategy for
correcting erroneous trajectories in agentic workflows. However, existing
approaches only exploit such capability in the post-action stage, where the
agent observes the execution outcomes. We argue that, like humans, LLMs can
also engage in reflection before action execution: the agent can anticipate
undesirable outcomes from its own decisions, which not only provides a
necessarily complementary perspective to evaluate the decision but also
prevents the propagation of errors throughout the trajectory. In this paper, we
propose MIRROR, a framework that consists of both intra-reflection, which
critically assesses intended actions before execution, and inter-reflection,
which further adjusts the trajectory based on observations. This design
systematically leverages LLM reflection capabilities to eliminate and rectify
erroneous actions on a more comprehensive scope. Evaluations on both the
StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks demonstrate MIRROR's superior
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法（自动策略优化和人工反馈）在复杂任务中存在成本高或扩展性差的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过LLM从次优代理轨迹中识别关键状态，提供动作建议和隐式奖励以指导策略优化。

Result: 在标准RL基准测试中，该方法优于现有最优基线。

Conclusion: LLM的引入有效解决了RL训练中的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in various
domains, training effective policies for complex tasks remains challenging.
Agents often converge to local optima and fail to maximize long-term rewards.
Existing approaches to mitigate training bottlenecks typically fall into two
categories: (i) Automated policy refinement, which identifies critical states
from past trajectories to guide policy updates, but suffers from costly and
uncertain model training; and (ii) Human-in-the-loop refinement, where human
feedback is used to correct agent behavior, but this does not scale well to
environments with large or continuous action spaces. In this work, we design a
large language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to
improve RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We
first prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's
trajectories. Based on these states, the LLM then provides action suggestions
and assigns implicit rewards to guide policy refinement. Experiments across
standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based explanations in
addressing RL training bottlenecks.

Conclusion: GIFARC通过类比方法有效提升AI在ARC任务中的表现，接近人类推理水平。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) poses a stringent test of general
AI capabilities, requiring solvers to infer abstract patterns from only a
handful of examples. Despite substantial progress in deep learning,
state-of-the-art models still achieve accuracy rates of merely 40-55% on 2024
ARC Competition, indicative of a significant gap between their performance and
human-level reasoning. In this work, we seek to bridge that gap by introducing
an analogy-inspired ARC dataset, GIFARC. Leveraging large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), we synthesize new ARC-style tasks
from a variety of GIF images that include analogies. Each new task is paired
with ground-truth analogy, providing an explicit mapping between visual
transformations and everyday concepts. By embedding robust human-intuitive
analogies into ARC-style tasks, GIFARC guides AI agents to evaluate the task
analogically before engaging in brute-force pattern search, thus efficiently
reducing problem complexity and build a more concise and human-understandable
solution. We empirically validate that guiding LLM with analogic approach with
GIFARC affects task-solving approaches of LLMs to align with analogic approach
of human.

Conclusion: 当前VLMs的空间推理能力仍有显著差距，Jigsaw-Puzzles可作为推动该领域研究的挑战性基准。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling
individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It
relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object
relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and
decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs)
exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark
consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial
complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate
VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities,
while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better
isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that
even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy
and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00%
accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human
participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress,
positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for
advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of
contemporary digital transformation by integrating generative AI and
Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with an Automation Agent to
realize End-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing
tasks. While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective
for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in
handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making.
This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising
automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP,
item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception
handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and
human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through
an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the
system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in
processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and
improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy
and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision
support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from
human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling
capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration
of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the
limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex
corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other
domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes
future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.

Result: 在WebShop和InterCode-SQL基准测试中，RRO表现出优越性能且探索成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: RRO通过优化奖励趋势，显著提升了语言模型代理在多步任务中的表现，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a
variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex
multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of
certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle
mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the
reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every
reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models
(PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number
of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire
the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this
issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps
and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for
process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO).
Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until
identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising
rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands
the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing
high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on
the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO
achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.

especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier
is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity
of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets
or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the
intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world
scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a
multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access
scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth
science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere,
featuring over 7K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted
from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning
from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and
knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth
supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple
choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in
graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity
resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific
reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and
innovation in this field. Resources related to this benchmark can be found at

*Alfin Wijaya Rahardja,Junwei Liu,Weitong Chen,Zhenpeng Chen,Yiling Lou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于LLM的代理系统维护问题，构建了AGENTISSUE-BENCH基准，并发现现有SE代理在解决代理系统问题时的效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理系统在多个领域广泛应用，但其维护成本高且问题解决困难，现有SE代理在传统软件中表现良好，但在代理系统中效果未知。

Method: 手动分析201个真实代理问题，构建包含50个任务的AGENTISSUE-BENCH基准，并评估现有SE代理的表现。

Result: SE代理在AGENTISSUE-BENCH上的解决率仅为3.33%-12.67%，表明代理系统维护的独特挑战。

Conclusion: 代理系统维护需要进一步研究，以开发更先进的SE代理工具。

Abstract: LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been
widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and
programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as
they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing
external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e.,
bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While
recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in
addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how
effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ
significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually
analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent
issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a
reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an
executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate
state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited
effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results
underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to
traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop
advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues. Data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在分子优化方面潜力巨大，但尚未充分探索其在结构化推理、可解释性和工具化分子优化中的应用。

Method: MT-Mol采用多智能体框架，结合RDKit工具，分为五个领域，由专家代理管理，通过代理协作实现分子优化。

Result: 在PMO-1K基准测试的23项任务中，MT-Mol在17项任务中表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MT-Mol展示了多智能体框架在分子优化中的潜力，特别是在工具引导的推理和可解释性方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have large potential for molecular optimization,
as they can gather external chemistry tools and enable collaborative
interactions to iteratively refine molecular candidates. However, this
potential remains underexplored, particularly in the context of structured
reasoning, interpretability, and comprehensive tool-grounded molecular
optimization. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Mol, a multi-agent framework
for molecular optimization that leverages tool-guided reasoning and
role-specialized LLM agents. Our system incorporates comprehensive RDKit tools,
categorized into five distinct domains: structural descriptors, electronic and
topological features, fragment-based functional groups, molecular
representations, and miscellaneous chemical properties. Each category is
managed by an expert analyst agent, responsible for extracting task-relevant
tools and enabling interpretable, chemically grounded feedback. MT-Mol produces
molecules with tool-aligned and stepwise reasoning through the interaction
between the analyst agents, a molecule-generating scientist, a reasoning-output
verifier, and a reviewer agent. As a result, we show that our framework shows
the state-of-the-art performance of the PMO-1K benchmark on 17 out of 23 tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在解决数学问题时可能产生逻辑或计算错误，需要一种验证和修正机制。

Method: 使用Formalizer将自然语言解转为形式化内容，Critic结合外部工具评估并反馈错误。

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench上验证了框架的优越性。

Conclusion: MATH-VF能有效验证和修正LLM生成的数学解，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in
solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and
computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper
proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for
formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language
models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to
translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our
Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra
System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within
the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides
corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in
two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the
correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF
identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator
for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the
Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our
framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench,
demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，将静态系统最优交通分配问题转化为单智能体任务，通过顺序推荐路径以最小化系统总旅行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究个性化路径推荐能否在集体层面实现系统最优交通分配。

Method: 采用MSA引导的深度Q学习算法，将传统交通分配方法的迭代结构融入强化学习训练过程。

Result: 在Braess网络中收敛到理论最优解，在OW网络中仅偏离0.35%。

Conclusion: 通过学习型顺序分配，为个体路径选择与系统效率的桥梁提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Modern navigation systems and shared mobility platforms increasingly rely on
personalized route recommendations to improve individual travel experience and
operational efficiency. However, a key question remains: can such sequential,
personalized routing decisions collectively lead to system-optimal (SO) traffic
assignment? This paper addresses this question by proposing a learning-based
framework that reformulates the static SO traffic assignment problem as a
single-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) task. A central agent
sequentially recommends routes to travelers as origin-destination (OD) demands
arrive, to minimize total system travel time. To enhance learning efficiency
and solution quality, we develop an MSA-guided deep Q-learning algorithm that
integrates the iterative structure of traditional traffic assignment methods
into the RL training process. The proposed approach is evaluated on both the
Braess and Ortuzar-Willumsen (OW) networks. Results show that the RL agent
converges to the theoretical SO solution in the Braess network and achieves
only a 0.35% deviation in the OW network. Further ablation studies demonstrate
that the route action set's design significantly impacts convergence speed and
final performance, with SO-informed route sets leading to faster learning and
better outcomes. This work provides a theoretically grounded and practically
relevant approach to bridging individual routing behavior with system-level
efficiency through learning-based sequential assignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可控的逻辑假设生成框架CtrlHGen，用于知识图谱上的溯因推理，解决了假设空间坍塌和假设过度敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可控性，大规模知识图谱上的溯因推理可能生成大量冗余或不相关的假设，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出CtrlHGen框架，采用两阶段训练范式（监督学习和强化学习），通过子逻辑分解的数据增强策略和语义奖励机制解决关键挑战。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，CtrlHGen不仅更好地满足控制条件，还实现了优于基线的语义相似性性能。

Conclusion: CtrlHGen框架显著提升了溯因推理的可控性和实用性，为复杂逻辑假设生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs aims to generate plausible logical
hypotheses from observed entities, with broad applications in areas such as
clinical diagnosis and scientific discovery. However, due to a lack of
controllability, a single observation may yield numerous plausible but
redundant or irrelevant hypotheses on large-scale knowledge graphs. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of controllable hypothesis generation to
improve the practical utility of abductive reasoning. This task faces two key
challenges when controlling for generating long and complex logical hypotheses:
hypothesis space collapse and hypothesis oversensitivity. To address these
challenges, we propose CtrlHGen, a Controllable logcial Hypothesis Generation
framework for abductive reasoning over knowledge graphs, trained in a two-stage
paradigm including supervised learning and subsequent reinforcement learning.
To mitigate hypothesis space collapse, we design a dataset augmentation
strategy based on sub-logical decomposition, enabling the model to learn
complex logical structures by leveraging semantic patterns in simpler
components. To address hypothesis oversensitivity, we incorporate smoothed
semantic rewards including Dice and Overlap scores, and introduce a
condition-adherence reward to guide the generation toward user-specified
control constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our model not only better adheres to control conditions but
also achieves superior semantic similarity performance compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LAENet面临复杂决策、资源限制和环境不确定性，传统RL在泛化性、奖励设计和模型稳定性方面存在局限。LLMs的出现为RL提供了新的改进机会。

Method: 提出将LLMs集成到RL中，利用其生成、上下文理解和结构化推理能力，构建LLM增强的RL框架，应用于LAENet的信息处理、奖励设计、决策和生成。

Result: 通过案例研究，展示了LLMs设计奖励函数如何提升RL在LAENet中的学习性能。

Conclusion: 总结了LLM增强RL的潜力，并讨论了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Low-Altitude Economic Networking (LAENet) aims to support diverse flying
applications below 1,000 meters by deploying various aerial vehicles for
flexible and cost-effective aerial networking. However, complex
decision-making, resource constraints, and environmental uncertainty pose
significant challenges to the development of the LAENet. Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers a potential solution in response to these challenges but has
limitations in generalization, reward design, and model stability. The
emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for RL to
mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we first present a tutorial about
integrating LLMs into RL by using the capacities of generation, contextual
understanding, and structured reasoning of LLMs. We then propose an
LLM-enhanced RL framework for the LAENet in terms of serving the LLM as
information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator.
Moreover, we conduct a case study by using LLMs to design a reward function to
improve the learning performance of RL in the LAENet. Finally, we provide a
conclusion and discuss future work.

TL;DR: 论文提出ALIGN框架，通过自动对齐接口缓解LLM代理与环境之间的不匹配问题，显著提升代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在交互决策任务中表现出色，但代理与环境之间的接口不匹配（agent-environment misalignment）成为性能瓶颈，现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 提出ALIGN框架，通过丰富接口的静态信息和逐步观察数据，自动对齐代理与环境的交互，无需修改代理逻辑或环境代码。

Result: 实验表明，ALIGN在多个领域（如具身任务、网页导航和工具使用）中显著提升代理性能，ALFWorld任务中成功率最高提升45.67%。

Conclusion: ALIGN框架有效解决了代理与环境的接口不匹配问题，且具有跨代理架构和LLM骨干的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning
capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks. These agents interact with
environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces
and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However,
mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent
regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions
in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment
misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent
strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still
remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that
agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent
performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an
\underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface
\underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment
by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface
enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise
observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this
interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or
the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied
tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements,
with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile,
ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures
and LLM backbones without interface regeneration. Code and experimental results
are available at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/ALIGN.

Motivation: 研究如何通过更高效的方法提升大型语言模型的推理能力，避免零强化学习的高成本和数据需求。

Method: 采用基于基础模型的简单蒸馏方法，仅需少量示例（920个），并通过分析模型输出的token频率验证其效果。

Result: 蒸馏模型在推理中更灵活，使用更多拟人化token和逻辑连接词，并显著提升两种高级认知行为（多视角思考和元认知意识）的频率。

Conclusion: 蒸馏方法在提升模型推理能力方面优于零强化学习，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has played an important role in improving the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Some studies apply RL
directly to \textit{smaller} base models (known as zero-RL) and also achieve
notable progress. However, in this paper, we show that using only 920 examples,
a simple distillation method based on the base model can clearly outperform
zero-RL, which typically requires much more data and computational cost. By
analyzing the token frequency in model outputs, we find that the distilled
model shows more flexible reasoning. It uses anthropomorphic tokens and logical
connectors much more often than the zero-RL model. Further analysis reveals
that distillation enhances the presence of two advanced cognitive behaviors:
Multi-Perspective Thinking or Attempting and Metacognitive Awareness. Frequent
occurrences of these two advanced cognitive behaviors give rise to flexible
reasoning, which is essential for solving complex reasoning problems, while
zero-RL fails to significantly boost the frequency of these behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但它们存在显著的社会偏见，现有研究主要集中于检测和量化偏见，但对模型内部机制的理解有限。

Method: 通过信息流分析识别模型推理过程中高贡献的图像标记，并设计多轮对话机制评估这些标记是否编码敏感信息。

Result: 实验表明LVLMs在处理不同人口群体图像时存在系统性信息利用差异，且文本模态的语义表示也显示偏见模式。

Conclusion: 社会偏见根植于模型的内部推理动态，研究为跨模态偏见形成提供了新解释。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal tasks, yet they also exhibit notable social biases. These biases
often manifest as unintended associations between neutral concepts and
sensitive human attributes, leading to disparate model behaviors across
demographic groups. While existing studies primarily focus on detecting and
quantifying such biases, they offer limited insight into the underlying
mechanisms within the models. To address this gap, we propose an explanatory
framework that combines information flow analysis with multi-round dialogue
evaluation, aiming to understand the origin of social bias from the perspective
of imbalanced internal information utilization. Specifically, we first identify
high-contribution image tokens involved in the model's reasoning process for
neutral questions via information flow analysis. Then, we design a multi-turn
dialogue mechanism to evaluate the extent to which these key tokens encode
sensitive information. Extensive experiments reveal that LVLMs exhibit
systematic disparities in information usage when processing images of different
demographic groups, suggesting that social bias is deeply rooted in the model's
internal reasoning dynamics. Furthermore, we complement our findings from a
textual modality perspective, showing that the model's semantic representations
already display biased proximity patterns, thereby offering a cross-modal
explanation of bias formation.

Motivation: 探讨如何设计可解释的分类器，使得其决策（正负）都能通过小规模的DNF公式解释。

Method: 研究k-DNF及其补集也能表示为k-DNF的特性，比较深度k决策树和嵌套k-DNF模型。

Result: 实验表明，嵌套k-DNF在可解释性和准确性上优于深度k决策树。

Conclusion: 嵌套k-DNF是一种有潜力的替代模型，尤其在需要高可解释性和准确性的场景。

Abstract: A classifier is considered interpretable if each of its decisions has an
explanation which is small enough to be easily understood by a human user. A
DNF formula can be seen as a binary classifier $\kappa$ over boolean domains.
The size of an explanation of a positive decision taken by a DNF $\kappa$ is
bounded by the size of the terms in $\kappa$, since we can explain a positive
decision by giving a term of $\kappa$ that evaluates to true. Since both
positive and negative decisions must be explained, we consider that
interpretable DNFs are those $\kappa$ for which both $\kappa$ and
$\overline{\kappa}$ can be expressed as DNFs composed of terms of bounded size.
In this paper, we study the family of $k$-DNFs whose complements can also be
expressed as $k$-DNFs. We compare two such families, namely depth-$k$ decision
trees and nested $k$-DNFs, a novel family of models. Experiments indicate that
nested $k$-DNFs are an interesting alternative to decision trees in terms of
interpretability and accuracy.

Motivation: 传统评估方法（如逐步动作准确性和任务成功率）只能宏观评估DC agents的性能，无法提供微观层面的潜在错误分析，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Conclusion: XBOUND方法为DC agents的性能评估提供了更细致的视角，有助于发现潜在问题并推动进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred increased
interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents), such as utilizing in-the-wild
device control to manage graphical user interfaces. Conventional methods for
assessing the capabilities of DC agents, such as computing step-wise action
accuracy and overall task success rates, provide a macroscopic view of DC
agents' performance; however, they fail to offer microscopic insights into
potential errors that may occur in real-world applications. Conducting a
finer-grained performance evaluation of DC agents presents significant
challenges. This study introduces a new perspective on evaluation methods for
DC agents by proposing the XBOUND evaluation method, which employs the
calculation of a novel Explore Metric to delineate the capability boundaries of
DC agents. Compared to previous evaluation methods, XBOUND focuses on
individual states to assess the proficiency of DC agents in mastering these
states. Furthermore, we have developed a ``pseudo'' episode tree dataset
derived from Android Control test data. Utilizing this dataset and XBOUND, we
comprehensively evaluate the OS-Atlas and UI-TARS series, examining both the
overall and specific performance across five common tasks. Additionally, we
select representative cases to highlight the current deficiencies and
limitations inherent in both series. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有法律判决预测模型虽整合了司法先例和法律知识，但忽视了法律推理逻辑的灵活性，尤其在复杂案件中表现不佳。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在所有指标上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应调整法律判决逻辑，显著提升了法律判决预测的性能。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) is a pivotal task in legal AI. Existing
semantic-enhanced LJP models integrate judicial precedents and legal knowledge
for high performance. But they neglect legal reasoning logic, a critical
component of legal judgments requiring rigorous logical analysis. Although some
approaches utilize legal reasoning logic for high-quality predictions, their
logic rigidity hinders adaptation to case-specific logical frameworks,
particularly in complex cases that are lengthy and detailed. This paper
proposes a rule-enhanced legal judgment prediction framework based on
first-order logic (FOL) formalism and comparative learning (CL) to develop an
adaptive adjustment mechanism for legal judgment logic and further enhance
performance in LJP. Inspired by the process of human exam preparation, our
method follows a three-stage approach: first, we initialize judgment rules
using the FOL formalism to capture complex reasoning logic accurately; next, we
propose a Confusion-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) to dynamically optimize
the judgment rules through a quiz consisting of confusable cases; finally, we
utilize the optimized judgment rules to predict legal judgments. Experimental
results on two public datasets show superior performance across all metrics.

Motivation: 传统诊断模型在系统过于复杂时表现不佳，功能建模成为更优选择。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system
diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.
Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex,
making functional modeling a more attractive approach. Our approach introduces
a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the
Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model. It incorporates two coordinated LLM
components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML
logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive
diagnostics. The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to
as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning. Expert knowledge or
operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and
diagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language
queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate
tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation
across the KG-DML. Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM
agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks. For diagnostics,
the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG
reasoning. For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding
them into the prompt to generate natural explanations. A case study on an
auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with
over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction,
supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.

Conclusion: ChemCoTBench为LLMs在科学创新中的应用奠定了基础，填补了抽象推理与化学发现之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in
chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks
like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks
focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required
for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To
address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges
molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations,
including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical
problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular
transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables
slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while
grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on
two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction
Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured
evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and
baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning
methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for
advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

*R. Spencer Hallyburton,Miroslav Pajic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种神经符号范式（NeuSPaPer），通过结合对象检测和场景图生成（SGG）实现深度场景理解，以提升AI在安全关键领域的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在安全关键领域缺乏安全保障，需要结合符号结构提升其可靠性和推理能力。

Method: 提出神经符号范式NeuSPaPer，结合对象检测和SGG，利用基础模型提取知识，设计结构化关系图框架。

Result: 通过物理模拟器和真实数据集验证，SGG能有效连接低层感知与高层推理，提升AI的可靠性和上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: NeuSPaPer为CPS中的可信自主性提供了基础，推动了AI在安全关键领域的应用。

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art AI models deployed in cyber-physical systems (CPS),
while highly accurate, are simply pattern-matchers.~With limited security
guarantees, there are concerns for their reliability in safety-critical and
contested domains. To advance assured AI, we advocate for a paradigm shift that
imbues data-driven perception models with symbolic structure, inspired by a
human's ability to reason over low-level features and high-level context. We
propose a neuro-symbolic paradigm for perception (NeuSPaPer) and illustrate how
joint object detection and scene graph generation (SGG) yields deep scene
understanding.~Powered by foundation models for offline knowledge extraction
and specialized SGG algorithms for real-time deployment, we design a framework
leveraging structured relational graphs that ensures the integrity of
situational awareness in autonomy. Using physics-based simulators and
real-world datasets, we demonstrate how SGG bridges the gap between low-level
sensor perception and high-level reasoning, establishing a foundation for
resilient, context-aware AI and advancing trusted autonomy in CPS.

TL;DR: MME-Reasoning是一个新的基准测试，旨在全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的逻辑推理能力，涵盖归纳、演绎和溯因推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估MLLMs的推理能力，缺乏对推理类型的明确分类和对推理理解的不足。

Method: 设计MME-Reasoning基准，覆盖三种推理类型，确保问题有效评估推理能力而非感知或知识广度。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进的MLLMs在综合逻辑推理中存在显著局限性，且在不同推理类型中表现不平衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MLLMs在逻辑推理中的关键局限性和不平衡表现，为理解和评估推理能力提供了系统见解。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an
essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the
significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to
comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit
categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of
reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all
three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its
questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question
effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or
knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation
of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical
reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance
in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across
reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches
such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to
enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations
and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning
scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the
understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by
intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the
skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this
field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over
understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves
non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic
expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this
paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters
foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core
mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary
curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification
reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach,
we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two
classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction
survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and
usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with
students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their
limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly
enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning. Materials:

Motivation: 受人类多粒度运动技能启发，解决现有技能发现方法仅支持单技能的局限性。

Method: 提出MRSD框架，并行学习多分辨率技能编码器，高层管理器动态选择技能。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite任务中表现优于现有方法，收敛更快且性能更高。

Conclusion: 多分辨率技能集成可提升HRL的效率和适应性，为智能体设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) relies on abstract skills to solve
long-horizon tasks efficiently. While existing skill discovery methods learns
these skills automatically, they are limited to a single skill per task. In
contrast, humans learn and use both fine-grained and coarse motor skills
simultaneously. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Multi-Resolution
Skill Discovery (MRSD), an HRL framework that learns multiple skill encoders at
different temporal resolutions in parallel. A high-level manager dynamically
selects among these skills, enabling adaptive control strategies over time. We
evaluate MRSD on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and show that it
outperforms prior state-of-the-art skill discovery and HRL methods, achieving
faster convergence and higher final performance. Our findings highlight the
benefits of integrating multi-resolution skills in HRL, paving the way for more
versatile and efficient agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过观察生成的数据学习任何基于代理模型（ABM）的可微分替代模型，结合扩散模型和图神经网络，直接建模个体代理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABM中的规则通常不可微分，限制了基于梯度优化的方法及其与现实世界数据的结合。

Method: 结合扩散模型捕捉行为随机性和图神经网络建模代理交互，直接建模个体行为而非系统级输出。

Result: 在Schelling隔离模型和捕食者-猎物生态系统中验证，能复制个体级模式并准确预测训练外的涌现动态。

Conclusion: 展示了扩散模型与图学习结合在数据驱动ABM模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties
in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions
and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable,
limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus
integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a
differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method
combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural
networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches,
our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating
system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving
the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our
approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey
ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately
forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the
potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM
simulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于记忆增强大型语言模型（LLM）的透明且数据高效的投资决策框架，用于早期初创企业投资。该方法通过自然语言策略和上下文学习（ICL）实现高精度预测，且易于专家解释和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期初创企业投资数据稀缺且结果不确定，传统机器学习方法需要大量标注数据且不透明，难以满足专家需求。

Method: 采用记忆增强LLM和上下文学习，将自然语言策略嵌入提示中，结合少量样本学习和反馈循环，无需梯度优化。

Result: 系统预测初创企业成功的准确率远超基准，比随机猜测高20倍，比顶级风投公司高7.1倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险投资提供了透明、数据高效且可解释的决策工具，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Early-stage startup investment is a high-risk endeavor characterized by
scarce data and uncertain outcomes. Traditional machine learning approaches
often require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain
opaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper,
we propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework
powered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context
learning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded
directly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning
patterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively
refine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines
few-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update
its decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal
supervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup
success far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more
precise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x
more precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital
(VC) firms.

Motivation: 自动化在开放环境中生成鲁棒假设对AI认知至关重要，但传统ILP依赖专家预定义符号结构，而纯LLM方法对噪声敏感。

Method: 结合多智能体系统（LLM驱动）和ILP，自动从原始文本数据生成符号词汇和关系模板（语言偏置），并转化为ILP可处理的事实，学习可解释规则。

Result: 在多样化挑战性场景中的实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化、可解释且可验证的假设生成开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for
AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system,
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP). Our system's LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic
vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias}
directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the
construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck
for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver,
which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes
traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the
noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse,
challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for
automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FMEnets是一种基于物理信息的机器学习框架，用于设计和分析非理想活塞流反应器，通过整合基本控制方程实现多尺度建模，支持正向和逆向问题求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反应器设计和分析方法在处理复杂非理想流动时存在局限性，FMEnets旨在通过物理信息机器学习提供更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: FMEnets由三个互联子网络组成，分别优化流体流动、反应物传输和温度分布，支持正向预测和逆向参数推断，采用FME-PINNs或FME-KANs实现。

Result: FMEnets在三种反应场景中表现优异，相对误差低于2.5%，FME-KANs对噪声更鲁棒，两种实现方式在无噪声条件下性能相当。

Conclusion: FMEnets为反应器设计和优化提供了高效计算工具，并展示了整合物理方程与实验数据的潜力。

Abstract: We propose FMEnets, a physics-informed machine learning framework for the
design and analysis of non-ideal plug flow reactors. FMEnets integrates the
fundamental governing equations (Navier-Stokes for fluid flow, material balance
for reactive species transport, and energy balance for temperature
distribution) into a unified multi-scale network model. The framework is
composed of three interconnected sub-networks with independent optimizers that
enable both forward and inverse problem-solving. In the forward mode, FMEnets
predicts velocity, pressure, species concentrations, and temperature profiles
using only inlet and outlet information. In the inverse mode, FMEnets utilizes
sparse multi-residence-time measurements to simultaneously infer unknown
kinetic parameters and states. FMEnets can be implemented either as FME-PINNs,
which employ conventional multilayer perceptrons, or as FME-KANs, based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the
critical role of the FMEnets architecture in achieving accurate predictions.
Specifically, FME-KANs are more robust to noise than FME-PINNs, although both
representations are comparable in accuracy and speed in noise-free conditions.
The proposed framework is applied to three different sets of reaction scenarios
and is compared with finite element simulations. FMEnets effectively captures
the complex interactions, achieving relative errors less than 2.5% for the
unknown kinetic parameters. The new network framework not only provides a
computationally efficient alternative for reactor design and optimization, but
also opens new avenues for integrating empirical correlations, limited and
noisy experimental data, and fundamental physical equations to guide reactor
design.

Motivation: 研究半监督学习中深度生成模型（如GANs和VAEs）的模式缺失和模式覆盖问题，以及分类与生成任务之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了一种新的无向生成模型JRFs，通过联合随机近似随机场（JRFs）算法解决上述问题。

Result: 实验表明JRFs在平衡模式覆盖和模式缺失方面表现良好，并在MNIST、SVHN和CIFAR-10数据集上实现了与现有方法相当的分类性能，同时生成质量高。

Conclusion: JRFs是一种有效的无向生成模型，适用于半监督学习，能够同时优化分类和生成任务。

Abstract: Our examination of deep generative models (DGMs) developed for
semi-supervised learning (SSL), mainly GANs and VAEs, reveals two problems.
First, mode missing and mode covering phenomenons are observed in genertion
with GANs and VAEs. Second, there exists an awkward conflict between good
classification and good generation in SSL by employing directed generative
models. To address these problems, we formally present
joint-stochastic-approximation random fields (JRFs) -- a new family of
algorithms for building deep undirected generative models, with application to
SSL. It is found through synthetic experiments that JRFs work well in balancing
mode covering and mode missing, and match the empirical data distribution well.
Empirically, JRFs achieve good classification results comparable to the
state-of-art methods on widely adopted datasets -- MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 in
SSL, and simultaneously perform good generation.

Conclusion: PDFBench为功能驱动的从头蛋白质设计提供了统一评估框架，推动未来研究。

Abstract: In recent years, while natural language processing and multimodal learning
have seen rapid advancements, the field of de novo protein design has also
experienced significant growth. However, most current methods rely on
proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between
different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ
evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of
designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address
these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks:
description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and
multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility,
structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of
novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing
their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze
inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories
of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes
a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein
design.

Motivation: 传统方法中，生成模型作为行为模型与策略优化分离，阻碍了多模态分布拟合与策略改进的同步优化，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出Decision Flow框架，将基于流的模型的动作生成过程建模为流决策过程，每个动作生成步骤对应一个流决策，从而统一优化流策略并捕捉多模态动作分布。

Result: 在多个离线强化学习环境中，Decision Flow达到或超越了现有基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: Decision Flow通过统一多模态动作分布建模与策略优化，显著提升了模型性能，为强化学习领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, generative models have shown remarkable capabilities across
diverse fields, including images, videos, language, and decision-making. By
applying powerful generative models such as flow-based models to reinforcement
learning, we can effectively model complex multi-modal action distributions and
achieve superior robotic control in continuous action spaces, surpassing the
limitations of single-modal action distributions with traditional
Gaussian-based policies. Previous methods usually adopt the generative models
as behavior models to fit state-conditioned action distributions from datasets,
with policy optimization conducted separately through additional policies using
value-based sample weighting or gradient-based updates. However, this
separation prevents the simultaneous optimization of multi-modal distribution
fitting and policy improvement, ultimately hindering the training of models and
degrading the performance. To address this issue, we propose Decision Flow, a
unified framework that integrates multi-modal action distribution modeling and
policy optimization. Specifically, our method formulates the action generation
procedure of flow-based models as a flow decision-making process, where each
action generation step corresponds to one flow decision. Consequently, our
method seamlessly optimizes the flow policy while capturing multi-modal action
distributions. We provide rigorous proofs of Decision Flow and validate the
effectiveness through extensive experiments across dozens of offline RL
environments. Compared with established offline RL baselines, the results
demonstrate that our method achieves or matches the SOTA performance.

TL;DR: FastCache通过隐藏状态级缓存和压缩框架加速DiT推理，减少计算冗余，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型计算密集，迭代结构和深度Transformer堆栈导致效率低下，FastCache旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出双策略：空间感知令牌选择机制和Transformer级缓存，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明FastCache显著降低延迟和内存使用，生成质量优于其他缓存方法。

Conclusion: FastCache在保持生成质量的同时，有效提升了DiT模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain
computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer
stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a
hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT
inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations.
FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection
mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state
saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations
across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules
work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation
fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows
that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a
hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple
DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage,
with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as
measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on
GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

TL;DR: GraLoRA是一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过分区权重矩阵解决LoRA的梯度纠缠问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中表现优异，但在高秩时易过拟合且性能停滞，无法达到全微调效果。

Method: 提出GraLoRA，将权重矩阵分块并为每个子块配备低秩适配器，以增加表示能力。

Result: 在代码生成和常识推理任务中，GraLoRA性能优于LoRA，最高提升8.5%。

Conclusion: GraLoRA是一种可扩展且鲁棒的参数高效微调解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) of generative models, valued for its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite recent enhancements, LoRA still suffers from a
fundamental limitation: overfitting when the bottleneck is widened. It performs
best at ranks 32-64, yet its accuracy stagnates or declines at higher ranks,
still falling short of full fine-tuning (FFT) performance. We identify the root
cause as LoRA's structural bottleneck, which introduces gradient entanglement
to the unrelated input channels and distorts gradient propagation. To address
this, we introduce a novel structure, Granular Low-Rank Adaptation (GraLoRA)
that partitions weight matrices into sub-blocks, each with its own low-rank
adapter. With negligible computational or storage cost, GraLoRA overcomes
LoRA's limitations, effectively increases the representational capacity, and
more closely approximates FFT behavior. Experiments on code generation and
commonsense reasoning benchmarks show that GraLoRA consistently outperforms
LoRA and other baselines, achieving up to +8.5% absolute gain in Pass@1 on
HumanEval+. These improvements hold across model sizes and rank settings,
making GraLoRA a scalable and robust solution for PEFT. Code, data, and scripts
are available at https://github.com/SqueezeBits/GraLoRA.git

Result: 在长时程应变数据上测试，混合模型比基线CNN模型灵敏度提升21%，低信噪比信号检测表现更优。

Conclusion: 物理启发的CNN特征后处理可提升模型可解释性和检测效率，弥合深度学习与领域知识的差距。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in
gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to
automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the
physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the
interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture
that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF)
classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike
prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method
introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final
convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF
classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration
strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a
relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10
events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals
(SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy
environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both
CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to
classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among
the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated
post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for
interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep
learning and domain knowledge.

Result: 在IMDb、Anthropic HH和AlpacaEval数据集上表现优异，平衡了对齐性能和模型漂移。

Conclusion: Ra-DPO通过风险感知优化，有效提升了模型的安全性和对齐性能。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human
values and intentions, maximizing the estimated reward can lead to superior
performance, but it also introduces potential risks due to deviations from the
reference model's intended behavior. Most existing methods typically introduce
KL divergence to constrain deviations between the trained model and the
reference model; however, this may not be sufficient in certain applications
that require tight risk control. In this paper, we introduce Risk-aware Direct
Preference Optimization (Ra-DPO), a novel approach that incorporates
risk-awareness by employing a class of nested risk measures. This approach
formulates a constrained risk-aware advantage function maximization problem and
then converts the Bradley-Terry model into a token-level representation. The
objective function maximizes the likelihood of the policy while suppressing the
deviation between a trained model and the reference model using a sequential
risk ratio, thereby enhancing the model's risk-awareness. Experimental results
across three open-source datasets: IMDb Dataset, Anthropic HH Dataset, and
AlpacaEval, demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in balancing
alignment performance and model drift. Our code is opensourced at

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种多源多目标任务领域重加权框架，旨在同时优化多个目标任务的预训练数据混合，提升模型在不同任务上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域重加权算法通常针对单一目标任务优化数据混合，导致模型在特定任务上过拟合而在其他任务上表现下降。GRAPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GRAPE通过动态调整源领域的采样权重（领域权重）和任务权重，优先考虑学习难度较高的任务。其机制被建模为一个极小极大优化问题，内层最大化通过DRO调整任务权重，外层最小化优化领域权重以最大化损失减少。

Conclusion: GRAPE通过多目标任务优化，显著提升了模型在不同任务和语言上的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse downstream
applications is fundamentally governed by the quality and composition of their
pretraining corpora. Existing domain reweighting algorithms primarily optimize
data mixtures for a single target task, thereby resulting in models that
overfit to specialized objectives while exhibiting substantial performance
degradation on other benchmarks. This paper introduces Group Robust
Multi-target Adaptive PrEtraining (GRAPE), a novel multi-source-multi-target
domain reweighting framework designed to calibrate pretraining data mixtures
for robust performance across multiple target tasks simultaneously. GRAPE
dynamically adjusts sampling weights across source domains (domain weights)
while concurrently modulating task weights that quantify the relative
importance of each individual target task. This adaptive process prioritizes
tasks based on their learning difficulty throughout training. We formulate this
interleaved reweighting mechanism as a minimax optimization problem: The inner
maximization adjusts task weights leveraging group
distributed-robust-optimization (DRO), where those tasks demonstrating the
least improvement under the current data mixture are prioritized with higher
weights; The outer minimization then optimizes domain weights to maximize loss
reduction on the prioritized tasks. Experiments on ClimbLab and SlimPajama
datasets demonstrate that GRAPE consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of reasoning performance across 6 benchmarks. Furthermore, when applied
to multilingual targets, GRAPE effectively identifies optimal training mixtures
from mainstream languages, achieving superior language modeling capabilities
across 8 low-resource target languages.

Motivation: 理解对抗条件如何影响语言模型需要捕捉高维激活空间中全局结构和局部细节的技术。

Method: 采用持久同调（PH）分析六种先进LLM在两种攻击模式（后门微调和间接提示注入）下的多尺度潜在空间动态。

Result: 对抗条件压缩潜在拓扑结构，减少小尺度结构多样性，放大粗尺度主导特征；神经元级PH框架量化信息流动和转换。

Conclusion: PH为解释LLM表征动态提供了统一方法，尤其在分布偏移下表现优异。

Abstract: Understanding how adversarial conditions affect language models requires
techniques that capture both global structure and local detail within
high-dimensional activation spaces. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool
from topological data analysis, to systematically characterize multiscale
latent space dynamics in LLMs under two distinct attack modes -- backdoor
fine-tuning and indirect prompt injection. By analyzing six state-of-the-art
LLMs, we show that adversarial conditions consistently compress latent
topologies, reducing structural diversity at smaller scales while amplifying
dominant features at coarser ones. These topological signatures are
statistically robust across layers, architectures, model sizes, and align with
the emergence of adversarial effects deeper in the network. To capture
finer-grained mechanisms underlying these shifts, we introduce a neuron-level
PH framework that quantifies how information flows and transforms within and
across layers. Together, our findings demonstrate that PH offers a principled
and unifying approach to interpreting representational dynamics in LLMs,
particularly under distributional shift.

Conclusion: HoPE有效提升了视觉语言模型在长上下文任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios,
particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been
widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies
in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate
different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However,
these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth
theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation
strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals
that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities
over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of
Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs.
HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic
modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling
mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse
context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long
video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently
outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Code is available

Abstract: Generative modeling of time series is a central challenge in time series
analysis, particularly under data-scarce conditions. Despite recent advances in
generative modeling, a comprehensive understanding of how state-of-the-art
generative models perform under limited supervision remains lacking. In this
work, we conduct the first large-scale study evaluating leading generative
models in data-scarce settings, revealing a substantial performance gap between
full-data and data-scarce regimes. To close this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based generative framework that can synthesize high-fidelity time
series across diverse domains using just a few examples. Our model is
pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets,
enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations. It further
incorporates architectural innovations such as dynamic convolutional layers for
flexible channel adaptation and dataset token conditioning for domain-aware
generation. Without requiring abundant supervision, our unified model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings-outperforming domain-specific
baselines across a wide range of subset sizes. Remarkably, it also surpasses
all baselines even when tested on full datasets benchmarks, highlighting the
strength of pre-training and cross-domain generalization. We hope this work
encourages the community to revisit few-shot generative modeling as a key
problem in time series research and pursue unified solutions that scale
efficiently across domains. Code is available at

Abstract: Multiple change point (MCP) detection in non-stationary time series is
challenging due to the variety of underlying patterns. To address these

with Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) for robust MCP detection. Our method
leverages spectral analysis to identify potential changes and employs AL to
strategically select new sampling points for improved efficiency. By
incorporating the modeling flexibility of DGPs with the change-identification
capabilities of spectral methods, our approach adapts to diverse spectral
change behaviors and effectively localizes multiple change points. Experiments
on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and sampling efficiency for
non-stationary time series.

Motivation: 传统方法（如经验模型和CFD模拟）在速度和准确性之间存在局限，无法满足复杂环境的需求。

Method: BlastOFormer采用SDF编码和网格到网格注意力架构，基于Transformer框架，训练数据来自CFD求解器。

Result: BlastOFormer在R2得分（0.9516）和误差指标上表现最佳，推理速度比CFD快60万倍。

Conclusion: BlastOFormer可作为复杂环境中爆炸压力估计的实时替代方案，优于传统CFD方法。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blast pressure fields is essential for applications in
structural safety, defense planning, and hazard mitigation. Traditional methods
such as empirical models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
offer limited trade offs between speed and accuracy; empirical models fail to
capture complex interactions in cluttered environments, while CFD simulations
are computationally expensive and time consuming. In this work, we introduce
BlastOFormer, a novel Transformer based surrogate model for full field maximum
pressure prediction from arbitrary obstacle and charge configurations.
BlastOFormer leverages a signed distance function (SDF) encoding and a grid to
grid attention based architecture inspired by OFormer and Vision Transformer
(ViT) frameworks. Trained on a dataset generated using the open source
blastFoam CFD solver, our model outperforms convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) across both log transformed and
unscaled domains. Quantitatively, BlastOFormer achieves the highest R2 score
(0.9516) and lowest error metrics, while requiring only 6.4 milliseconds for
inference, more than 600,000 times faster than CFD simulations. Qualitative
visualizations and error analyses further confirm BlastOFormer's superior
spatial coherence and generalization capabilities. These results highlight its
potential as a real time alternative to conventional CFD approaches for blast
pressure estimation in complex environments.

Motivation: 数据异构性对联邦学习的挑战促使研究如何更好地理解其对全局决策边界的影响。

Method: 提出FedProj框架，包括服务器端知识转移损失和利用公共未标记数据集的记忆机制。

Result: FedProj在实验中大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedProj有效解决了全局决策边界遗忘问题，提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning
very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as
local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though
effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect
the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing
an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example.
Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer
from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn
the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights,
and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained
optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning
framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its
forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion,
we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further
calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of
learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an
episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to
regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental
results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin.

Method: 提出Manifold-Projected Neural ODEs（PNODEs），通过半显式微分-代数方程（DAEs）框架，将每个ODE步骤投影到约束流形上，包括稳健迭代版本和快速近似版本。

Result: PNODEs在六个基准问题上表现优于基线方法，平均约束违反误差低于10^-10，且运行时更低。

Conclusion: 约束投影为学习物理一致的长时程动力学提供了一种简单有效的策略。

Abstract: Despite the promise of scientific machine learning (SciML) in combining
data-driven techniques with mechanistic modeling, existing approaches for
incorporating hard constraints in neural differential equations (NDEs) face
significant limitations. Scalability issues and poor numerical properties
prevent these neural models from being used for modeling physical systems with
complicated conservation laws. We propose Manifold-Projected Neural ODEs
(PNODEs), a method that explicitly enforces algebraic constraints by projecting
each ODE step onto the constraint manifold. This framework arises naturally
from semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and includes both a
robust iterative variant and a fast approximation requiring a single Jacobian
factorization. We further demonstrate that prior works on relaxation methods
are special cases of our approach. PNODEs consistently outperform baselines
across six benchmark problems achieving a mean constraint violation error below
$10^{-10}$. Additionally, PNODEs consistently achieve lower runtime compared to
other methods for a given level of error tolerance. These results show that
constraint projection offers a simple strategy for learning physically
consistent long-horizon dynamics.

Motivation: FP8数据格式在LLM预训练中具有巨大潜力，但由于大规模训练中的稳定性问题，其应用受到限制。现有方法通常依赖次优的FP8内核或回退到高精度计算，牺牲了吞吐量优势。

Method: 引入新型LLM架构，首次支持在Transformer块的所有GEMM（前向和反向传播）中使用FP8计算，并通过减少大异常激活值来稳定FP8训练。同时提出了监控低精度训练的关键指标。

Result: 新型架构在保持与BF16训练相当的下游性能的同时，实现了前所未有的吞吐量提升，尤其是在大规模训练中。

Conclusion: 该研究为FP8在LLM预训练中的广泛应用提供了可行的解决方案，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Despite the significant potential of FP8 data formats for large language
model (LLM) pre-training, their adoption has been limited due to challenges in
maintaining stability at scale. Existing approaches often rely on suboptimal
fine-grained FP8 kernels or fall back to higher-precision matrix
multiplications (GEMMs) in sensitive components, such as attention projections,
compromising potential throughput gains. We introduce a new class of LLM
architectures that, for the first time, support FP8 computation for all GEMMs
within transformer blocks during both forward and backward passes. This enables
unprecedented throughput gains, particularly at scale, while matching the
downstream performance of standard BF16 training. Our architecture design
reduces large outlier activations, promoting stable long-term FP8 training. In
addition, we identify key metrics to monitor low-precision training and predict
potential future divergences.

Abstract: This paper investigates a general robust one-shot aggregation framework for

propose a geometric median-based aggregation algorithm that leverages $k$-means
clustering to resolve the permutation ambiguity in local client estimations.
Our method first performs k-means to partition client-provided estimators into
clusters and then aggregates estimators within each cluster using the geometric
median. This approach provably remains effective even in highly heterogeneous
scenarios where at most half of the clients can observe only a minimal number
of samples. The key theoretical contribution lies in the combined analysis of
the geometric median's error bound-aided by sample quantiles-and the maximum
misclustering rates of the aforementioned solution of $k$-means. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is further supported by simulation
studies conducted under various heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: RoMAE是一种通用且高效的方法，适用于多模态数据，同时揭示了RoPE在输入序列中嵌入学习位置时的局限性。

Abstract: Applying Transformers to irregular time-series typically requires
specializations to their baseline architecture, which can result in additional
computational overhead and increased method complexity. We present the Rotary
Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with
multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any
time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's
performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate
time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized
time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC
Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In
addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous
positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input
sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.

Motivation: 解决MLPs在无限宽度时的非参数性、点极限缺失、非高斯特性丢失以及高频特征学习能力差的问题。

Method: 基于谐波分析的三个原则：1) 枚举感知机并引入非学习权重以确保收敛；2) 引入缩放（或频率）因子；3) 选择能产生近正交系统的激活函数。

Result: ZeNNs在无限宽度时实现点收敛，展现丰富渐近结构，支持特征学习；在有限宽度时能高效学习低维域函数的高频特征。

Conclusion: ZeNNs成功解决了MLPs的多个关键问题，尤其在无限宽度和有限宽度场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new simple architecture, Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs), in order
to overcome several shortcomings of standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
Namely, in the large width limit, MLPs are non-parametric, they do not have a
well-defined pointwise limit, they lose non-Gaussian attributes and become
unable to perform feature learning; moreover, finite width MLPs perform poorly
in learning high frequencies. The new ZeNN architecture is inspired by three
simple principles from harmonic analysis:
  i) Enumerate the perceptons and introduce a non-learnable weight to enforce
convergence;
  ii) Introduce a scaling (or frequency) factor;
  iii) Choose activation functions that lead to near orthogonal systems.
  We will show that these ideas allow us to fix the referred shortcomings of
MLPs. In fact, in the infinite width limit, ZeNNs converge pointwise, they
exhibit a rich asymptotic structure beyond Gaussianity, and perform feature
learning. Moreover, when appropriate activation functions are chosen, (finite
width) ZeNNs excel at learning high-frequency features of functions with low
dimensional domains.

Result: 在TL;DR数据集上测试，PET方法学习的策略性能高且KL散度大。

Conclusion: PET展示了学习悲观奖励模型的可行性，无需正则化即可避免奖励黑客攻击。

Abstract: This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to
learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling
techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL
regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when
optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward
hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset
distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when
optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET,
reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test
our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can
learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any
regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset
distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work
shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward
hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic
reward without suffering from reward hacking.

exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such
as backtracking and error correction. However, conventional Markovian RL
confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic
policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state.
Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during
Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this,
we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which
explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over
Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes
both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via
belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and
switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance
on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on
both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL
outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior
token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness. Our code is available

*Jingjing Liu,Xiansen Ju,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双层次无监督特征选择方法（BLUFS），结合聚类层次和特征层次，通过谱聚类和线性回归模型优化特征选择，并采用ℓ2,0-范数约束提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常仅从单一视角建模，难以同时评估特征重要性和保留数据结构，限制了性能。

Method: BLUFS方法包含聚类层次（谱聚类生成伪标签）和特征层次（ℓ2,0-范数约束投影矩阵），设计了高效的PAM算法求解模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，BLUFS在聚类和分类任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: BLUFS首次将双层次框架与ℓ2,0-范数结合，显著提升了无监督特征选择的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is an important task in data
engineering. However, most UFS methods construct models from a single
perspective and often fail to simultaneously evaluate feature importance and
preserve their inherent data structure, thus limiting their performance. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel bi-level unsupervised feature
selection (BLUFS) method, including a clustering level and a feature level.
Specifically, at the clustering level, spectral clustering is used to generate
pseudo-labels for representing the data structure, while a continuous linear
regression model is developed to learn the projection matrix. At the feature
level, the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint is imposed on the projection matrix for
more effectively selecting features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to combine a bi-level framework with the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm. To solve
the proposed bi-level model, we design an efficient proximal alternating
minimization (PAM) algorithm, whose subproblems either have explicit solutions
or can be computed by fast solvers. Furthermore, we establish the convergence
result and computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on two
synthetic datasets and eight real datasets demonstrate the superiority of BLUFS
in clustering and classification tasks.

TL;DR: Ctrl-DNA是一个基于约束强化学习的框架，用于设计具有可控细胞类型特异性的调控DNA序列，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计精确细胞类型特异性基因表达的调控DNA序列对合成生物学、基因治疗和精准医学至关重要。现有基于Transformer的语言模型在生成新序列时难以保证可靠的细胞特异性活性。

Method: 通过将调控序列设计转化为生物信息约束优化问题，应用强化学习对自回归基因组语言模型进行迭代优化，以最大化目标细胞类型的调控活性并限制脱靶效应。

Result: Ctrl-DNA在人类启动子和增强子上的评估显示，其性能优于现有生成和基于强化学习的方法，生成高适应性调控序列并实现最佳细胞类型特异性。生成的序列还捕获了关键的细胞类型特异性转录因子结合位点。

Conclusion: Ctrl-DNA通过约束强化学习框架成功设计出具有高细胞类型特异性和生物合理性的调控DNA序列。

Abstract: Designing regulatory DNA sequences that achieve precise cell-type-specific
gene expression is crucial for advancements in synthetic biology, gene therapy
and precision medicine. Although transformer-based language models (LMs) can
effectively capture patterns in regulatory DNA, their generative approaches
often struggle to produce novel sequences with reliable cell-specific activity.
Here, we introduce Ctrl-DNA, a novel constrained reinforcement learning (RL)
framework tailored for designing regulatory DNA sequences with controllable
cell-type specificity. By formulating regulatory sequence design as a
biologically informed constrained optimization problem, we apply RL to
autoregressive genomic LMs, enabling the models to iteratively refine sequences
that maximize regulatory activity in targeted cell types while constraining
off-target effects. Our evaluation on human promoters and enhancers
demonstrates that Ctrl-DNA consistently outperforms existing generative and
RL-based approaches, generating high-fitness regulatory sequences and achieving
state-of-the-art cell-type specificity. Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences
capture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short
DNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression,
demonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体强化学习（MARL）中‘隐藏礼物’（即其他智能体的有益行为未被察觉）对信用分配的挑战，并通过一个简单的网格世界任务展示了现有算法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在多智能体环境中，当智能体的有益行为对其他智能体不可见时，如何有效分配信用以促进合作。

Method: 设计了一个简单的网格世界任务，智能体需要通过共享钥匙解锁门以获得集体奖励，但钥匙的传递行为对其他智能体不可见。测试了多种RL和MARL算法。

Result: 现有算法难以完成任务，而独立模型无关的策略梯度智能体在提供自身行为历史信息后可以解决任务。通过引入修正项，进一步提高了其学习稳定性。

Conclusion: ‘隐藏礼物’增加了多智能体信用分配的难度，独立智能体的学习意识可以改善此类问题。

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are
unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not
to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can
benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden
gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others
are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a
very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have
individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if
all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.
However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective
reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they
use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents
have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden
gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including
MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this
simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient
agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own
action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action
history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents,
inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning
and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results
show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly
challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning
awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

Motivation: 解决传统蛋白质预测任务需要专用模型的问题，开发广泛适用且计算高效的蛋白质语言模型。

Method: 使用自回归解码器，结合预训练蛋白质编码器的嵌入和可学习任务标记，进行多样化预测。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，速度显著提升（如比AlphaFold2快近1000倍），性能匹配或超越专用方法。

Conclusion: Prot2Token为蛋白质建模提供了通用高效的新范式，有望加速生物发现和药物开发。

Abstract: The diverse nature of protein prediction tasks has traditionally necessitated
specialized models, hindering the development of broadly applicable and
computationally efficient Protein Language Models (PLMs). In this work, we
introduce Prot2Token, a unified framework that overcomes these challenges by
converting a wide spectrum of protein-related predictions, from sequence-level
properties and residue-specific attributes to complex inter-protein
interactions, into a standardized next-token prediction format. At its core,
Prot2Token employs an autoregressive decoder, conditioned on embeddings from
pre-trained protein encoders and guided by learnable task tokens, to perform
diverse predictions. This architecture uniquely facilitates multi-task
learning, enabling a single model to master numerous tasks with improved
efficiency. We present extensive experimental validation across a variety of
benchmarks, demonstrating Prot2Tokens strong predictive power in different
types of protein-prediction tasks. Key results include significant speedups
(e.g., near 1000x over AlphaFold2 with MSA) and performance often matching or
exceeding specialized approaches. Beyond that, we introduce an auxiliary
self-supervised decoder pre-training approach to improve spatially sensitive
task performance. Prot2Token thus offers a significant step towards a
versatile, high-throughput paradigm for protein modeling, promising to
accelerate biological discovery and the development of novel therapeutics. The

Motivation: 离线RL依赖外部数据集，易受中毒攻击，其顺序性加剧了风险。

Method: 利用差分隐私特性，扩展认证防御，覆盖连续和离散空间及随机与确定性环境。

Result: 实验表明，在7%数据中毒时性能下降不超过50%，认证半径扩大5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了离线RL的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Similar to other machine learning frameworks, Offline Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is shown to be vulnerable to poisoning attacks, due to its reliance on
externally sourced datasets, a vulnerability that is exacerbated by its
sequential nature. To mitigate the risks posed by RL poisoning, we extend
certified defenses to provide larger guarantees against adversarial
manipulation, ensuring robustness for both per-state actions, and the overall
expected cumulative reward. Our approach leverages properties of Differential
Privacy, in a manner that allows this work to span both continuous and discrete
spaces, as well as stochastic and deterministic environments -- significantly
expanding the scope and applicability of achievable guarantees. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that our approach ensures the performance drops to no
more than $50\%$ with up to $7\%$ of the training data poisoned, significantly
improving over the $0.008\%$ in prior work~\citep{wu_copa_2022}, while
producing certified radii that is $5$ times larger as well. This highlights the
potential of our framework to enhance safety and reliability in offline RL.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI系统中通过固定权重惩罚方法强制执行外部约束存在不足，无法同时满足约束条件和性能要求，且调参成本高。

Method: 提出采用拉格朗日方法等定制化约束优化方法，动态优化惩罚系数（拉格朗日乘子），并与模型同步训练。

Result: 定制化方法能真正解决约束问题、减少调参需求，并兼容现代深度学习流程。

Conclusion: 定制化约束优化方法优于传统固定权重惩罚方法，更适合构建可信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: Recent efforts toward developing trustworthy AI systems with accountability
guarantees have led to a growing reliance on machine learning formulations that
incorporate external requirements, or constraints. These requirements are often
enforced through penalization--adding fixed-weight terms to the task loss. We
argue that this approach is ill-suited, and that tailored constrained
optimization methods should be adopted instead. In particular, no penalty
coefficient may yield a solution that both satisfies the constraints and
achieves good performance--i.e., one solving the constrained problem. Moreover,
tuning these coefficients is costly, incurring significant time and
computational overhead. In contrast, tailored constrained methods--such as the
Lagrangian approach, which optimizes the penalization "coefficients" (the
Lagrange multipliers) alongside the model--(i) truly solve the constrained
problem and add accountability, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty
tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines.

TL;DR: SGShift是一种检测表格数据中概念漂移并归因于稀疏特征集的模型，通过GAM建模和特征选择实现，性能显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在训练数据之外的数据上性能下降，概念漂移导致模型学习错误表示，识别漂移特征有助于理解数据集差异。

Method: SGShift使用广义加性模型（GAM）建模概念漂移，结合特征选择和扩展方法（如knockoffs和吸收项）控制假发现和模型拟合问题。

Result: 在合成和真实数据实验中，SGShift的AUC>0.9，召回率>90%，性能是基线方法的2-3倍。

Conclusion: SGShift能有效检测概念漂移并识别关键特征，为模型性能下降提供解释，适用于科学相关维度分析。

Abstract: Regardless the amount of data a machine learning (ML) model is trained on,
there will inevitably be data that differs from their training set, lowering
model performance. Concept shift occurs when the distribution of labels
conditioned on the features changes, making even a well-tuned ML model to have
learned a fundamentally incorrect representation. Identifying these shifted
features provides unique insight into how one dataset differs from another,
considering the difference may be across a scientifically relevant dimension,
such as time, disease status, population, etc. In this paper, we propose
SGShift, a model for detecting concept shift in tabular data and attributing
reduced model performance to a sparse set of shifted features. SGShift models
concept shift with a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and performs subsequent
feature selection to identify shifted features. We propose further extensions
of SGShift by incorporating knockoffs to control false discoveries and an
absorption term to account for models with poor fit to the data. We conduct
extensive experiments in synthetic and real data across various ML models and
find SGShift can identify shifted features with AUC $>0.9$ and recall $>90\%$,
often 2 or 3 times as high as baseline methods.

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在适当记忆和推理方法下，推理速度提升，计算成本最高减少56%。

Conclusion: LLMs可通过任务重复暴露实现推理加速，SpeedupLLM框架为相关研究提供了理论基础和实现方法。

Abstract: Allocating more compute to large language models (LLMs) reasoning has
generally been demonstrated to improve their effectiveness, but also results in
increased inference time. In contrast, humans can perform tasks faster and
better with increased experience and exposure. Hence, this paper aims to
investigate the question: Can LLMs also become faster at reasoning through
recurrent exposure on relevant tasks, and if so, how can it be achieved? To
address these questions, we first formalize the problem setting of LLM
reasoning speedup systematically in the dimensions of task relevancy and
compute budget calculation. We then propose SpeedupLLM, a theoretically
guaranteed framework to implement and benchmark such reasoning speedup
behaviour based on adaptive compute allocation and memory mechanisms. We
further conduct comprehensive experiments to benchmark such behaviour across
different question similarity levels, memory methods, and reasoning methods.
Results show that LLMs can generally reason faster with past experience,
achieving up to a 56% reduction in compute cost when equipped with appropriate
memory and reasoning methods.

Motivation: 理解并控制神经网络的复杂性是机器学习的核心挑战，传统熵基方法难以捕捉网络结构中的因果相关性算法规律。

Method: 采用算法信息理论，结合算法概率（AP）和块分解方法（BDM），量化网络结构的复杂性变化。

Result: BDM比熵更准确地跟踪训练中的结构变化，与训练损失相关性更强，支持训练是算法压缩过程的观点。

Conclusion: 研究为基于信息理论和复杂性的学习与正则化提供了理论框架，揭示了学习过程中的算法规律内部化现象。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks
is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for
generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on
entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail
to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in
network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory,
using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in
algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our
approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded
lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation
of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely
tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting
stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and
randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a
process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the
progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work
offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework
for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles
from information theory, complexity, and computability.

Result: 实验表明PHN-HVVS在多个MOO任务中显著优于基线方法，并推动了联邦学习领域的研究。

Conclusion: PHN-HVVS有效解决了现有PFL方法的局限性，为高维空间MOO问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) exists extensively in machine learning,
and aims to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, called the Pareto front,
e.g., it is fundamental for multiple avenues of research in federated learning
(FL). Pareto-Front Learning (PFL) is a powerful method implemented using
Hypernetworks (PHNs) to approximate the Pareto front. This method enables the
acquisition of a mapping function from a given preference vector to the
solutions on the Pareto front. However, most existing PFL approaches still face
two challenges: (a) sampling rays in high-dimensional spaces; (b) failing to
cover the entire Pareto Front which has a convex shape. Here, we introduce a
novel PFL framework, called as PHN-HVVS, which decomposes the design space into
Voronoi grids and deploys a genetic algorithm (GA) for Voronoi grid
partitioning within high-dimensional space. We put forward a new loss function,
which effectively contributes to more extensive coverage of the resultant
Pareto front and maximizes the HV Indicator. Experimental results on multiple
MOO machine learning tasks demonstrate that PHN-HVVS outperforms the baselines
significantly in generating Pareto front. Also, we illustrate that PHN-HVVS
advances the methodologies of several recent problems in the FL field. The code

Conclusion: 通过优化视角的UED方法，能够显著提升强化学习代理的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: For reinforcement learning agents to be deployed in high-risk settings, they
must achieve a high level of robustness to unfamiliar scenarios. One method for
improving robustness is unsupervised environment design (UED), a suite of
methods aiming to maximise an agent's generalisability across configurations of
an environment. In this work, we study UED from an optimisation perspective,
providing stronger theoretical guarantees for practical settings than prior
work. Whereas previous methods relied on guarantees if they reach convergence,
our framework employs a nonconvex-strongly-concave objective for which we
provide a provably convergent algorithm in the zero-sum setting. We empirically
verify the efficacy of our method, outperforming prior methods in a number of
environments with varying difficulties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在处理极长序列时面临注意力矩阵静态化、梯度流动不稳定等问题，需要一种动态机制来增强长程依赖性和全局一致性。

Method: 通过扩散、波动或反应扩散等PDE动态演化注意力权重，替代静态注意力矩阵，从而平滑局部噪声、增强长程依赖并稳定梯度流动。

Conclusion: PDE-based注意力机制为注意力机制引入了连续时间动态和全局一致性，展示了其在处理长序列任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, Continuous_Time Attention, which infuses
partial differential equations (PDEs) into the Transformer's attention
mechanism to address the challenges of extremely long input sequences. Instead
of relying solely on a static attention matrix, we allow attention weights to
evolve over a pseudo_time dimension via diffusion, wave, or reaction_diffusion
dynamics. This mechanism systematically smooths local noise, enhances
long_range dependencies, and stabilizes gradient flow. Theoretically, our
analysis shows that PDE_based attention leads to better optimization landscapes
and polynomial rather than exponential decay of distant interactions.
Empirically, we benchmark our method on diverse experiments_demonstrating
consistent gains over both standard and specialized long sequence Transformer
variants. Our findings highlight the potential of PDE_based formulations to
enrich attention mechanisms with continuous_time dynamics and global coherence.

Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在优化大型语言模型时存在高计算开销和内存消耗的问题，主要由于需要多次生成和依赖复杂的优势估计。

Result: A*-PO在数学推理任务中表现优异，训练时间减少2倍，内存使用降低30%以上。

Conclusion: A*-PO为高效训练LLMs提供了新思路，显著提升了性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) to improve complex reasoning abilities. However,
state-of-the-art policy optimization methods often suffer from high
computational overhead and memory consumption, primarily due to the need for
multiple generations per prompt and the reliance on critic networks or
advantage estimates of the current policy. In this paper, we propose $A$*-PO, a
novel two-stage policy optimization framework that directly approximates the
optimal advantage function and enables efficient training of LLMs for reasoning
tasks. In the first stage, we leverage offline sampling from a reference policy
to estimate the optimal value function $V$*, eliminating the need for costly
online value estimation. In the second stage, we perform on-policy updates
using a simple least-squares regression loss with only a single generation per
prompt. Theoretically, we establish performance guarantees and prove that the
KL-regularized RL objective can be optimized without requiring complex
exploration strategies. Empirically, $A$*-PO achieves competitive performance
across a wide range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while reducing
training time by up to 2$\times$ and peak memory usage by over 30% compared to
PPO, GRPO, and REBEL. Implementation of $A$*-PO can be found at

Conclusion: EDALSSC通过改进不确定性估计和样本选择策略，提升了半监督分类的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised classification based on active learning has made significant
progress, but the existing methods often ignore the uncertainty estimation (or
reliability) of the prediction results during the learning process, which makes
it questionable whether the selected samples can effectively update the model.
Hence, this paper proposes an evidential deep active learning approach for
semi-supervised classification (EDALSSC). EDALSSC builds a semi-supervised
learning framework to simultaneously quantify the uncertainty estimation of
labeled and unlabeled data during the learning process. The uncertainty
estimation of the former is associated with evidential deep learning, while
that of the latter is modeled by combining ignorance information and conflict
information of the evidence from the perspective of the T-conorm operator.
Furthermore, this article constructs a heuristic method to dynamically balance
the influence of evidence and the number of classes on uncertainty estimation
to ensure that it does not produce counter-intuitive results in EDALSSC. For
the sample selection strategy, EDALSSC selects the sample with the greatest
uncertainty estimation that is calculated in the form of a sum when the
training loss increases in the latter half of the learning process.
Experimental results demonstrate that EDALSSC outperforms existing
semi-supervised and supervised active learning approaches on image
classification datasets.

Conclusion: 方法在真实脑数据中成功揭示了与行为状态相关的动态关系，为神经动力学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience
by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various
phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses
from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are
static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic,
state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt
dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict
relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We
propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted
superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear
relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying
interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves
f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average
over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well
over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to
uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable
insights into neural dynamics.

*Woomin Song,Jihoon Tack,Sangwoo Mo,Seunghyuk Oh,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Simba的分层稀疏化方法，通过剪枝令牌来增强状态空间模型（SSMs），在相同计算预算下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs中的令牌由于逐步的递归更新而高度冗余，密集的递归操作阻碍了历史信息的传递。上层SSMs更冗余，因为它们编码全局信息，而底层编码局部信息。

Method: 提出Simba，一种基于令牌剪枝的分层稀疏化方法，上层稀疏化程度高于底层，使其行为类似高速公路。提出新的令牌剪枝标准，通过累积局部递归衡量令牌对最终输出的全局影响。

Result: Simba在相同FLOPS下优于基线模型Mamba，并在自然语言任务中表现更优。同时改善了长序列的信息流。

Conclusion: Simba不仅提高了效率，还优化了长序列的信息传递，为SSMs提供了一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising architecture for sequence
modeling, providing an alternative to Transformers by replacing expensive
self-attention with linear recurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective trick to enhance SSMs within given computational budgets by
sparsifying them. Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due
to gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the
delivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of
SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower
layers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a
hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba
sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to
behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token pruning
criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final output
by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms the
baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language tasks.
Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only
enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long
sequences. Code is available at https://github.com/woominsong/Simba.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在时间序列预测中，移除数据嵌入层不仅不会降低性能，反而可能提升准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数据嵌入技术在时间序列预测中的实际有效性，因为现有复杂模型仅带来边际性能提升。

Method: 通过对15种前沿模型和4个基准数据集进行广泛的消融研究，移除数据嵌入层并对比性能。

Result: 移除嵌入层后，许多模型的预测性能未受影响，甚至有所提升，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 数据嵌入层在时间序列预测中并非必要，移除它们可能带来更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications,
and numerous complex forecasting models have been proposed in recent years.
Despite their architectural innovations, most state-of-the-art models report
only marginal improvements -- typically just a few thousandths in standard
error metrics. These models often incorporate complex data embedding layers to
transform raw inputs into higher-dimensional representations to enhance
accuracy. But are data embedding techniques actually effective in time series
forecasting? Through extensive ablation studies across fifteen state-of-the-art
models and four benchmark datasets, we find that removing data embedding layers
from many state-of-the-art models does not degrade forecasting performance. In
many cases, it improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The gains
from removing embedding layers often exceed the performance differences
typically reported between competing models. Code available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Recurrent Neural Operators（RNOs）的新框架，通过将循环训练整合到神经算子架构中，解决了时间依赖问题中训练与推理不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练策略（如教师强制）在时间依赖问题中会导致训练与推理的不匹配，从而在长期自回归预测中产生累积误差。

Method: RNOs在训练过程中递归地应用算子于其自身的预测，模拟推理时的动态，从而减少暴露偏差和误差累积。

Result: 理论证明循环训练能将误差增长从指数级降至线性级；实验表明RNOs在长期准确性和稳定性上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了训练与推理动态对齐对神经算子学习中时间泛化的重要性。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution
operators of partial differential equations. However, in time-dependent
problems, standard training strategies such as teacher forcing introduce a
mismatch between training and inference, leading to compounding errors in
long-term autoregressive predictions. To address this issue, we propose
Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs)-a novel framework that integrates recurrent
training into neural operator architectures. Instead of conditioning each
training step on ground-truth inputs, RNOs recursively apply the operator to
their own predictions over a temporal window, effectively simulating
inference-time dynamics during training. This alignment mitigates exposure bias
and enhances robustness to error accumulation. Theoretically, we show that
recurrent training can reduce the worst-case exponential error growth typical
of teacher forcing to linear growth. Empirically, we demonstrate that
recurrently trained Multigrid Neural Operators significantly outperform their
teacher-forced counterparts in long-term accuracy and stability on standard
benchmarks. Our results underscore the importance of aligning training with
inference dynamics for robust temporal generalization in neural operator
learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合伽马退化过程和新型维护模型的强化学习方法，用于优化维护策略，显著降低长期成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0的实施需要新的维护优化范式，而机器学习技术（尤其是强化学习）在工程和维护中的应用日益广泛。

Method: 使用Double Deep Q-Network架构的强化学习代理，无需预定义预防阈值，可在连续退化状态空间中运行。

Result: 代理在不同场景中表现出灵活性，显著优于其他常见维护策略，长期成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于现实系统退化行为，能有效优化维护策略，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient maintenance has always been essential for the successful
application of engineering systems. However, the challenges to be overcome in
the implementation of Industry 4.0 necessitate new paradigms of maintenance
optimization. Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly used in
engineering and maintenance, with reinforcement learning being one of the most
promising. In this paper, we propose a gamma degradation process together with
a novel maintenance model in which repairs are increasingly imperfect, i.e.,
the beneficial effect of system repairs decreases as more repairs are
performed, reflecting the degradational behavior of real-world systems. To
generate maintenance policies for this system, we developed a
reinforcement-learning-based agent using a Double Deep Q-Network architecture.
This agent presents two important advantages: it works without a predefined
preventive threshold, and it can operate in a continuous degradation state
space. Our agent learns to behave in different scenarios, showing great
flexibility. In addition, we performed an analysis of how changes in the main
parameters of the environment affect the maintenance policy proposed by the
agent. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be appropriate and to
significatively improve long-run cost as compared with other common maintenance
strategies.

Result: 在WEAR数据集上，改进模型对惯性数据的平均mAP提高了16.01%。

Conclusion: 改进的ActionFormer模型显著提升了传感器信号HAR的性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has recently witnessed advancements with
Transformer-based models. Especially, ActionFormer shows us a new perspectives
for HAR in the sense that this approach gives us additional outputs which
detect the border of the activities as well as the activity labels.
ActionFormer was originally proposed with its input as image/video. However,
this was converted to with its input as sensor signals as well. We analyze this
extensively in terms of deep learning architectures. Based on the report of
high temporal dynamics which limits the model's ability to capture subtle
changes effectively and of the interdependencies between the spatial and
temporal features. We propose the modified ActionFormer which will decrease
these defects for sensor signals. The key to our approach lies in accordance
with the Sequence-and-Excitation strategy to minimize the increase in
additional parameters and opt for the swish activation function to retain the
information about direction in the negative range. Experiments on the WEAR
dataset show that our method achieves substantial improvement of a 16.01\% in
terms of average mAP for inertial data.

Result: GLN的隐藏表示形式使得节点表示的变化（跨层和高级技术下）可直观分析，并在零样本节点分类和链接预测任务中优于现有基于LLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: GLN不仅提升了GNN的可解释性，还在零样本任务中表现出色，为理解GNN的内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across
diverse graph-related tasks, their high-dimensional hidden representations
render them black boxes. In this work, we propose Graph Lingual Network (GLN),
a GNN built on large language models (LLMs), with hidden representations in the
form of human-readable text. Through careful prompt design, GLN incorporates
not only the message passing module of GNNs but also advanced GNN techniques,
including graph attention and initial residual connection. The
comprehensibility of GLN's hidden representations enables an intuitive analysis
of how node representations change (1) across layers and (2) under advanced GNN
techniques, shedding light on the inner workings of GNNs. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that GLN achieves strong zero-shot performance on node

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Uni-Instruct的理论驱动框架，统一了10多种现有的一步扩散蒸馏方法，并通过扩散扩展理论解决了原始f-散度的难解性问题，实现了高效的一步扩散模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过理论驱动的框架统一现有的一步扩散蒸馏方法，并解决f-散度扩展的难解性问题。

Method: 提出Uni-Instruct框架，基于f-散度家族的扩散扩展理论，推导出等效且易处理的损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR10和ImageNet-64×64生成基准测试中，Uni-Instruct取得了创纪录的FID值，并在文本到3D生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Uni-Instruct在理论和实践上均具有重要贡献，为一步扩散蒸馏和扩散模型知识迁移的未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Conclusion: 本文为二元分类中模型性能的理论上限提供了实用且理论支持的方法，尤其在噪声软标签和隐私限制下表现优越。

Abstract: While the performance of machine learning systems has experienced significant
improvement in recent years, relatively little attention has been paid to the
fundamental question: to what extent can we improve our models? This paper
provides a means of answering this question in the setting of binary
classification, which is practical and theoretically supported. We extend a
previous work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the
optimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate
the properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the
original work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how
well the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay
significantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard
labels per instance grows. Second, we tackle a more challenging problem
setting: estimation with corrupted soft labels. One might be tempted to use
calibrated soft labels instead of clean ones. However, we reveal that
calibration guarantee is not enough, that is, even perfectly calibrated soft
labels can result in a substantially inaccurate estimate. Then, we show that
isotonic calibration can provide a statistically consistent estimator under an
assumption weaker than that of the previous work. Our method is instance-free,
i.e., we do not assume access to any input instances. This feature allows it to
be adopted in practical scenarios where the instances are not available due to
privacy issues. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the
validity of our methods and theory.

Result: 实验证明RedLamp在异常检测中有效，且对异常污染具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RedLamp通过多类伪异常和软标签学习，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research
area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on
the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal.
However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be
misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate
pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from
the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination
if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several
limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging.
(2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false
anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and
augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data
augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass
boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series
anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which
prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against
contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently
explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly
detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.

Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting, different variables often influence the
target variable over distinct time intervals, a challenge known as the
multi-delay issue. Traditional models typically process all variables or time
points uniformly, which limits their ability to capture complex variable
relationships and obtain non-trivial time representations. To address this
issue, we propose TimePro, an innovative Mamba-based model that constructs
variate- and time-aware hyper-states. Unlike conventional approaches that
merely transfer plain states across variable or time dimensions, TimePro
preserves the fine-grained temporal features of each variate token and
adaptively selects the focused time points to tune the plain state. The
reconstructed hyper-state can perceive both variable relationships and salient
temporal information, which helps the model make accurate forecasting. In
experiments, TimePro performs competitively on eight real-world long-term
forecasting benchmarks with satisfactory linear complexity. Code is available

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an
important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and
cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature,
fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation
medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional
phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging
as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of
the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for
automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial
intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from
video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video
recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation
(d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10
features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a
support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in
a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized
model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and
beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level.
Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined
with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be
applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may
potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of
experimental studies.

Abstract: Transformers have reshaped machine learning by utilizing attention mechanisms
to capture complex patterns in large datasets, leading to significant
improvements in performance. This success has contributed to the belief that
"bigger means better", leading to ever-increasing model sizes. This paper
challenge this ideology by showing that many existing transformers might be
unnecessarily oversized. We discover a theoretical principle that redefines the
role of multi-head attention. An important benefit of the multiple heads is in
improving the conditioning of the attention block. We exploit this theoretical
insight and redesign popular architectures with an increased number of heads.
The improvement in the conditioning proves so significant in practice that
model depth can be decreased, reducing the parameter count by up to 30-50%
while maintaining accuracy. We obtain consistent benefits across a variety of
transformer-based architectures of various scales, on tasks in computer vision
(ImageNet-1k) as well as language and sequence modeling (GLUE benchmark,
TinyStories, and the Long-Range Arena benchmark).

Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and
heart failure is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving patient
survival rates. Machine learning has revolutionized diagnostic methods in
recent years by developing classification models that detect diseases based on
selected features. However, these classification tasks are often highly
imbalanced, limiting the performance of classical models. Quantum models offer
a promising alternative, exploiting their ability to express complex patterns
by operating in a higher-dimensional computational space through superposition
and entanglement. These unique properties make quantum models potentially more
effective in addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets. This work
evaluates the potential of quantum classifiers in healthcare, focusing on
Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs),
comparing them with popular classical models. The study is based on three
well-known healthcare datasets -- Prostate Cancer, Heart Failure, and Diabetes.
The results indicate that QSVMs outperform QNNs across all datasets due to
their susceptibility to overfitting. Furthermore, quantum models prove the
ability to overcome classical models in scenarios with high dataset imbalance.
Although preliminary, these findings highlight the potential of quantum models
in healthcare classification tasks and lead the way for further research in
this domain.

TL;DR: ClustGDD提出了一种高效且有效的图数据蒸馏方法，通过聚类和同质性优化来压缩大规模图数据，显著提升了GNN训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图数据蒸馏方法依赖启发式对齐梯度或表示分布，导致结果质量下降或训练成本高昂。

Method: ClustGDD通过快速聚类最小化簇内平方和并最大化原始图同质性，结合类感知图采样和一致性损失优化节点属性。

Result: 实验表明，ClustGDD在五个基准数据集上的节点分类性能优于或媲美现有方法，且速度显著更快。

Conclusion: ClustGDD为高效图数据蒸馏提供了理论支持，显著提升了GNN训练效率和质量。

Abstract: Despite plentiful successes achieved by graph representation learning in
various domains, the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) still remains
tenaciously challenging due to the tremendous computational overhead needed for
sizable graphs in practice. Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which
seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as
a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing
GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation
distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result
quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by
this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD.
Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node
attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes
the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original
graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical
findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation
quality using Fr\'echet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for
synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the
homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the
condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph
sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs
trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior
or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node
classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude
faster.

It shows strong robustness. At the same time, the SHAP method is used to
analyze the importance and dependency of features, and it is found that the
external credit score variable plays a dominant role in model decision making,
which helps to improve the model's interpretability and practical application
value. The research results provide effective reference and technical support
for the intelligent development of credit risk control systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构蒸馏（HAD）方法，通过结合蒸馏和重构任务，在DNA序列建模中实现更高效和有效的预训练，性能超越同类模型甚至更大的教师模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自然语言领域中掩码语言建模（MLM）成功的启发，DNA序列建模也采用了自监督预训练和微调范式，但现有方法依赖大量数据或大模型，计算负担重。

Method: 使用NTv2-500M作为教师模型，设计分组掩码策略对齐可见标记的特征嵌入，同时在MLM预训练中重构不可见标记。

Result: 在Nucleotide Transformer Benchmark和Genomic Benchmark上表现优异，部分任务甚至超越参数大500倍的教师模型。

Conclusion: HAD方法在DNA序列建模中高效且有效，能深入理解基因组序列的内在表示模式。

Abstract: Inspired by the great success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in the
natural language domain, the paradigm of self-supervised pre-training and
fine-tuning has also achieved remarkable progress in the field of DNA sequence
modeling. However, previous methods often relied on massive pre-training data
or large-scale base models with huge parameters, imposing a significant
computational burden. To address this, many works attempted to use more compact
models to achieve similar outcomes but still fell short by a considerable
margin. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Architecture Distillation (HAD)
approach, leveraging both distillation and reconstruction tasks for more
efficient and effective pre-training. Specifically, we employ the NTv2-500M as
the teacher model and devise a grouping masking strategy to align the feature
embeddings of visible tokens while concurrently reconstructing the invisible
tokens during MLM pre-training. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Nucleotide Transformer
Benchmark and Genomic Benchmark. Compared to models with similar parameters,
our model achieved excellent performance. More surprisingly, it even surpassed
the distillation ceiling-teacher model on some sub-tasks, which is more than
500 $\times$ larger. Lastly, we utilize t-SNE for more intuitive visualization,
which shows that our model can gain a sophisticated understanding of the
intrinsic representation pattern in genomic sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FireQ是一种联合设计的PTQ框架和INT4-FP8矩阵乘法内核，显著提升LLM推理吞吐量，同时通过新颖的离群平滑技术减少量化精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理受内存带宽限制，需要后训练量化（PTQ）以提高吞吐量。

Method: FireQ量化线性层权重和键值为INT4，激活和查询为FP8，并引入三阶段流水线优化预填充阶段。采用离群平滑技术分别处理线性和注意力层量化问题。

Result: FireQ在Llama2-7B上实现前馈网络层推理速度提升1.68倍，在Llama3-8B上预填充阶段性能提升1.26倍，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FireQ通过联合设计和优化，显著提升LLM推理效率，是后训练量化的有效解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth
constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training
quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ
framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM
inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer
weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8,
significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage
pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel,
effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize
accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques
tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we
explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8
quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to
compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address
quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by
combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in
feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase
performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现一致提升，并解决了度偏差和结构差异等问题。

Conclusion: Aggregation Buffer是一种通用解决方案，显著提升了GNN的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We revisit DropEdge, a data augmentation technique for GNNs which randomly
removes edges to expose diverse graph structures during training. While being a
promising approach to effectively reduce overfitting on specific connections in
the graph, we observe that its potential performance gain in supervised
learning tasks is significantly limited. To understand why, we provide a
theoretical analysis showing that the limited performance of DropEdge comes
from the fundamental limitation that exists in many GNN architectures. Based on
this analysis, we propose Aggregation Buffer, a parameter block specifically
designed to improve the robustness of GNNs by addressing the limitation of
DropEdge. Our method is compatible with any GNN model, and shows consistent
performance improvements on multiple datasets. Moreover, our method effectively
addresses well-known problems such as degree bias or structural disparity as a
unifying solution. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Fusing heterogeneous information remains a persistent challenge in modern
data analysis. While significant progress has been made, existing approaches
often fail to account for the inherent heterogeneity of object patterns across
different semantic spaces. To address this limitation, we propose the
Cooperation of Experts (CoE) framework, which encodes multi-typed information
into unified heterogeneous multiplex networks. By overcoming modality and
connection differences, CoE provides a powerful and flexible model for
capturing the intricate structures of real-world complex data. In our
framework, dedicated encoders act as domain-specific experts, each specializing
in learning distinct relational patterns in specific semantic spaces. To
enhance robustness and extract complementary knowledge, these experts
collaborate through a novel large margin mechanism supported by a tailored
optimization strategy. Rigorous theoretical analyses guarantee the framework's
feasibility and stability, while extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and broad applicability. Our

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的进化计算优化器和单任务训练，限制了启发式算法的多样性和泛化能力。

Method: MoH通过LLMs迭代优化元优化器，自动构建多样化的优化器，并采用多任务训练。

Result: 实验表明，MoH在经典组合优化问题中表现优异，尤其在跨规模任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MoH提供了一种有效且可解释的元优化方法，显著提升了启发式算法的探索和泛化能力。

Abstract: Heuristic design with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising
approach for tackling combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However,
existing approaches often rely on manually predefined evolutionary computation
(EC) optimizers and single-task training schemes, which may constrain the
exploration of diverse heuristic algorithms and hinder the generalization of
the resulting heuristics. To address these issues, we propose Meta-Optimization
of Heuristics (MoH), a novel framework that operates at the optimizer level,
discovering effective optimizers through the principle of meta-learning.
Specifically, MoH leverages LLMs to iteratively refine a meta-optimizer that
autonomously constructs diverse optimizers through (self-)invocation, thereby
eliminating the reliance on a predefined EC optimizer. These constructed
optimizers subsequently evolve heuristics for downstream tasks, enabling
broader heuristic exploration. Moreover, MoH employs a multi-task training
scheme to promote its generalization capability. Experiments on classic COPs
demonstrate that MoH constructs an effective and interpretable meta-optimizer,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks,
particularly in cross-size settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化机器学习中，通信图拓扑对学习动态有重要影响，但现有图数据集多为营利性社交网络，缺乏多样性。Fediverse提供了开放的替代方案。

Method: 收集了7个Fediverse社交网络的182个图，每周爬取数据持续14周，并发布了Python工具包。

Result: 数据集支持多种任务，包括新的defederation任务（链接删除过程）。

Conclusion: Fedivertex为去中心化算法提供了更真实的基准测试数据，填补了现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally
and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by
exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables
better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting
is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph,
which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized
algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to
for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected
at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its
recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and
open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and
Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce Fedivertex, a
new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse,
crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python
package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks,
including a new defederation task, which captures a process of link deletion
observed on these networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效算法，显著提升了多校准和全预测问题的性能，改进了现有最佳边界，并在分布和在线设置中取得了多项改进的样本复杂度结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Garg等人（2024）提出的开放性问题，即是否能够高效实现有界线性函数的$O(\sqrt{T})$ $\ell_{2}$-多校准误差。

Method: 提出了一种高效算法，实现了$O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ $\ell_{2}$-交换多校准误差，并进一步推导出$\ell_{1}$-交换多校准和交换全预测的改进边界。

Result: 算法显著提升了性能，$\ell_{1}$-交换多校准和交换全预测误差达到$O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$，优于之前的最佳边界$O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$。

Conclusion: 研究不仅在在线设置中取得了改进，还在分布设置中提供了多项改进的样本复杂度结果，为相关领域提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the related problems of multicalibration -- a
multigroup fairness notion and omniprediction -- a simultaneous loss
minimization paradigm, both in the distributional and online settings. The
recent work of Garg et al. (2024) raised the open problem of whether it is
possible to efficiently achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ $\ell_{2}$-multicalibration error
against bounded linear functions. In this paper, we answer this question in a
strongly affirmative sense. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves
$O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ $\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibration error (both in high
probability and expectation). On propagating this bound onward, we obtain
significantly improved rates for $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap
omniprediction for a loss class of convex Lipschitz functions. In particular,
we show that our algorithm achieves $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ $\ell_{1}$-swap
multicalibration and swap omniprediction errors, thereby improving upon the
previous best-known bound of $O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$. As a consequence of our
improved online results, we further obtain several improved sample complexity
rates in the distributional setting. In particular, we establish a
$O(\varepsilon ^ {-3})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an
$\varepsilon$-swap omnipredictor for the class of convex and Lipschitz
functions, $O(\varepsilon ^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning
an $\varepsilon$-swap agnostic learner for the squared loss, and $O(\varepsilon
^ {-5}), O(\varepsilon ^ {-2.5})$ sample complexities of learning $\ell_{1},
\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibrated predictors against linear functions, all of
which significantly improve on the previous best-known bounds.

TL;DR: 通过一次性软对齐前向和反馈权重初始化，深度网络可达到与反向传播相当的性能，无需学习过程中的权重传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播依赖对称权重传输和全局同步，计算成本高且生物学上不现实；反馈对齐虽避免对称权重传输，但学习性能和稳定性较差。

Method: 在初始化时对前向和反馈权重进行一次性软对齐，促进稳定的误差最小化。

Result: 初始对齐改善了梯度流动和收敛性，网络泛化性和鲁棒性提升；适度偏离对称权重可增强对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单初始化策略可实现深度网络的有效学习，兼具生物学合理性和资源效率。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
symmetric weight transport and global synchronization makes it computationally
expensive and biologically implausible. Feedback alignment offers a promising
alternative by approximating error gradients through fixed random feedback,
thereby avoiding symmetric weight transport. However, this approach often
struggles with poor learning performance and instability, especially in deep
networks. Here, we show that a one-time soft alignment between forward and
feedback weights at initialization enables deep networks to achieve performance
comparable to backpropagation, without requiring weight transport during
learning. This simple initialization condition guides stable error minimization
in the loss landscape, improving network trainability. Spectral analyses
further reveal that initial alignment promotes smoother gradient flow and
convergence to flatter minima, resulting in better generalization and
robustness. Notably, we also find that allowing moderate deviations from exact
weight symmetry can improve adversarial robustness compared to standard
backpropagation. These findings demonstrate that a simple initialization
strategy can enable effective learning in deep networks in a biologically
plausible and resource-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HAR方法依赖滑动窗口，限制了长时依赖建模，DeepConvContext旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多尺度时间序列分类框架，结合LSTMs建模窗口内和窗口间的时间模式。

Result: 在六个HAR基准测试中，F1分数平均提升10%，最高提升21%。

Conclusion: DeepConvContext通过LSTMs有效建模时间依赖，优于基于注意力的方法，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies,
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window
approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the
DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting
learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this
constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series
classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based
Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and
inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows.
Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext
relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior
performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor
data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an
average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains
of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

Motivation: 研究现代神经网络（如Transformer）如何在没有内置绑定操作的情况下实现变量绑定，填补符号计算与认知的空白。

Method: 训练Transformer解引用符号程序中的变量，程序包含深度达四步的变量赋值链和干扰链。

Result: 模型经历三个训练阶段，最终利用残差流作为可寻址内存空间，通过注意力头动态跟踪变量绑定。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习系统性变量绑定机制，为连接主义和符号方法的融合提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is
fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical
architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it
is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding
operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a
Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where
variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each
program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep
to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments
acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with
three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical
constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and
(3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment
chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit
the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention
heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the
model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in
accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to
implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support,
bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Humble AI (Knowles et al., 2023) argues for cautiousness in AI development
and deployments through scepticism (accounting for limitations of statistical
learning), curiosity (accounting for unexpected outcomes), and commitment
(accounting for multifaceted values beyond performance). We present a
real-world case study for humble AI in the domain of algorithmic hiring.
Specifically, we evaluate virtual screening algorithms in a widely used hiring
platform that matches candidates to job openings. There are several challenges
in misrecognition and stereotyping in such contexts that are difficult to
assess through standard fairness and trust frameworks; e.g., someone with a
non-traditional background is less likely to rank highly. We demonstrate
technical feasibility of how humble AI principles can be translated to practice
through uncertainty quantification of ranks, entropy estimates, and a user
experience that highlights algorithmic unknowns. We describe preliminary
discussions with focus groups made up of recruiters. Future user studies seek
to evaluate whether the higher cognitive load of a humble AI system fosters a
climate of trust in its outcomes.

Conclusion: 提出了联邦HAR系统隐私部署的实用建议，并指出未来研究的开放挑战。

Abstract: While prior work has shown that Federated Learning updates can leak sensitive
information, label reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover input labels
from shared gradients, have not yet been examined in the context of Human
Activity Recognition (HAR). Given the sensitive nature of activity labels, this
study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art gradient-based label
leakage attacks on HAR benchmark datasets. Our findings show that the number of
activity classes, sampling strategy, and class imbalance are critical factors
influencing the extent of label leakage, with reconstruction accuracies
reaching up to 90% on two benchmark datasets, even for trained models.
Moreover, we find that Local Differential Privacy techniques such as gradient
noise and clipping offer only limited protection, as certain attacks still
reliably infer both majority and minority class labels. We conclude by offering
practical recommendations for the privacy-aware deployment of federated HAR
systems and identify open challenges for future research. Code to reproduce our

Conclusion: 主动学习方法在降低训练成本的同时，有效提升了MLMC的实用性。

Abstract: Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) is a flexible and effective variance reduction
technique for accelerating reliability assessments of complex power system.
Recently, data-driven surrogate models have been proposed as lower-level models
in the MLMC framework due to their high correlation and negligible execution
time once trained. However, in resource adequacy assessments, pre-labeled
datasets are typically unavailable. For large-scale systems, the efficiency
gains from surrogate models are often offset by the substantial time required
for labeling training data. Therefore, this paper introduces a speed metric
that accounts for training time in evaluating MLMC efficiency. Considering the
total time budget is limited, a vote-by-committee active learning approach is
proposed to reduce the required labeling calls. A case study demonstrates that,

*Max Collins,Jordan Vice,Tim French,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NatADiff是一种利用去噪扩散生成自然对抗样本的方法，旨在更真实地反映现实世界中的测试错误，并提高对抗样本的迁移性和图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注受限的对抗样本，未能准确反映现实世界中的测试错误。NatADiff旨在通过生成更自然的对抗样本来改进模型的鲁棒性。

Method: NatADiff结合去噪扩散和时间旅行采样，引导扩散轨迹到真实类别和对抗类别的交集，同时使用增强分类器指导以提高迁移性。

Result: NatADiff在攻击成功率上与现有技术相当，但在模型间迁移性和与自然测试错误的相似性（通过FID衡量）上表现更优。

Conclusion: NatADiff生成的对抗样本不仅迁移性更强，而且更接近自然发生的测试错误，为模型鲁棒性研究提供了更真实的工具。

Abstract: Adversarial samples exploit irregularities in the manifold ``learned'' by
deep learning models to cause misclassifications. The study of these
adversarial samples provides insight into the features a model uses to classify
inputs, which can be leveraged to improve robustness against future attacks.
However, much of the existing literature focuses on constrained adversarial
samples, which do not accurately reflect test-time errors encountered in
real-world settings. To address this, we propose `NatADiff', an adversarial
sampling scheme that leverages denoising diffusion to generate natural
adversarial samples. Our approach is based on the observation that natural
adversarial samples frequently contain structural elements from the adversarial
class. Deep learning models can exploit these structural elements to shortcut
the classification process, rather than learning to genuinely distinguish
between classes. To leverage this behavior, we guide the diffusion trajectory
towards the intersection of the true and adversarial classes, combining
time-travel sampling with augmented classifier guidance to enhance attack
transferability while preserving image fidelity. Our method achieves comparable
attack success rates to current state-of-the-art techniques, while exhibiting
significantly higher transferability across model architectures and better
alignment with natural test-time errors as measured by FID. These results
demonstrate that NatADiff produces adversarial samples that not only transfer
more effectively across models, but more faithfully resemble naturally
occurring test-time errors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Schirn的新方法，通过在高噪声标签矩阵上施加稀疏约束，同时确保预测标签矩阵的高秩特性，解决了部分多标签学习中的实际问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的部分多标签学习方法依赖于噪声标签矩阵的稀疏性和真实标签矩阵的低秩性假设，但这些假设在实际场景中不成立，因为真实标签矩阵通常是满秩或接近满秩的。

Method: 提出Schirn方法，在噪声标签矩阵上施加稀疏约束，同时强制预测标签矩阵具有高秩特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，Schirn在性能上优于现有方法，有效解决了现实中的部分多标签学习问题。

Conclusion: Schirn通过结合稀疏约束和高秩特性，为部分多标签学习提供了一种更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial Multi-Label Learning (PML) extends the multi-label learning paradigm
to scenarios where each sample is associated with a candidate label set
containing both ground-truth labels and noisy labels. Existing PML methods
commonly rely on two assumptions: sparsity of the noise label matrix and
low-rankness of the ground-truth label matrix. However, these assumptions are
inherently conflicting and impractical for real-world scenarios, where the true
label matrix is typically full-rank or close to full-rank. To address these
limitations, we demonstrate that the sparsity constraint contributes to the
high-rank property of the predicted label matrix. Based on this, we propose a
novel method Schirn, which introduces a sparsity constraint on the noise label
matrix while enforcing a high-rank property on the predicted label matrix.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Schirn compared
to state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in tackling
real-world PML challenges.

Abstract: The trajectories of 6G and AI are set for a creative collision. However,
current visions for 6G remain largely incremental evolutions of 5G, while
progress in AI is hampered by brittle, data-hungry models that lack robust
reasoning capabilities. This paper argues for a foundational paradigm shift,
moving beyond the purely technical level of communication toward systems
capable of semantic understanding and effective, goal-oriented interaction. We
propose a unified research vision rooted in the principles of System-2
cognition, built upon three pillars: Abstraction, enabling agents to learn
meaningful world models from raw sensorimotor data; Compositionality, providing
the algebraic tools to combine learned concepts and subsystems; and Emergent
Communication, allowing intelligent agents to create their own adaptive and
grounded languages. By integrating these principles, we lay the groundwork for
truly intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and collaborate, unifying
advances in wireless communications, machine learning, and robotics under a
single coherent framework.

Result: 发现表示遗忘随层数增加而加速，网络宽度增加则减缓遗忘，实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 表示差异度量有效且可分析，为理解持续学习行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: In continual learning scenarios, catastrophic forgetting of previously
learned tasks is a critical issue, making it essential to effectively measure
such forgetting. Recently, there has been growing interest in focusing on
representation forgetting, the forgetting measured at the hidden layer. In this
paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of representation forgetting
and use this analysis to better understand the behavior of continual learning.
First, we introduce a new metric called representation discrepancy, which
measures the difference between representation spaces constructed by two
snapshots of a model trained through continual learning. We demonstrate that
our proposed metric serves as an effective surrogate for the representation
forgetting while remaining analytically tractable. Second, through mathematical
analysis of our metric, we derive several key findings about the dynamics of
representation forgetting: the forgetting occurs more rapidly to a higher
degree as the layer index increases, while increasing the width of the network
slows down the forgetting process. Third, we support our theoretical findings
through experiments on real image datasets, including Split-CIFAR100 and
ImageNet1K.

<details>

Motivation: 现有无监督神经网络求解器在大规模图和高阶图的$k$-grouping问题上表现不佳，需要新的计算框架。

Method: 提出OH-PUBO建模方法，利用GPU加速算法和Gini系数连续松弛退火策略，以无监督方式优化目标函数。

Result: 实验表明，Deep $k$-grouping优于现有神经网络求解器和经典启发式方法（如SCIP和Tabu）。

Conclusion: Deep $k$-grouping为大规模组合优化问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Along with AI computing shining in scientific discovery, its potential in the
combinatorial optimization (CO) domain has also emerged in recent years. Yet,
existing unsupervised neural network solvers struggle to solve $k$-grouping
problems (e.g., coloring, partitioning) on large-scale graphs and hypergraphs,
due to limited computational frameworks. In this work, we propose Deep
$k$-grouping, an unsupervised learning-based CO framework. Specifically, we
contribute: Novel one-hot encoded polynomial unconstrained binary optimization
(OH-PUBO), a formulation for modeling k-grouping problems on graphs and
hypergraphs (e.g., graph/hypergraph coloring and partitioning); GPU-accelerated
algorithms for large-scale k-grouping CO problems. Deep $k$-grouping employs
the relaxation of large-scale OH-PUBO objectives as differentiable loss
functions and trains to optimize them in an unsupervised manner. To ensure
scalability, it leverages GPU-accelerated algorithms to unify the training
pipeline; A Gini coefficient-based continuous relaxation annealing strategy to
enforce discreteness of solutions while preventing convergence to local optima.
Experimental results demonstrate that Deep $k$-grouping outperforms existing
neural network solvers and classical heuristics such as SCIP and Tabu.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图信号处理的随机特征聚合方法（RFA），用于高效的身份和位置嵌入，无需训练即可实现高质量嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法在捕捉图结构属性（如身份或位置）时效率低且不明确，RFA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RFA采用无参数学习的谱基GNN，仅使用随机噪声输入，并通过一次前向传播生成嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，RFA的高通和低通滤波器变体分别能有效生成身份和位置嵌入，且效率优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFA在身份和位置嵌入的质量与效率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), which capture graph structures via a feature
aggregation mechanism following the graph embedding framework, have
demonstrated a powerful ability to support various tasks. According to the
topology properties (e.g., structural roles or community memberships of nodes)
to be preserved, graph embedding can be categorized into identity and position
embedding. However, it is unclear for most GNN-based methods which property
they can capture. Some of them may also suffer from low efficiency and
scalability caused by several time- and space-consuming procedures (e.g.,
feature extraction and training). From a perspective of graph signal
processing, we find that high- and low-frequency information in the graph
spectral domain may characterize node identities and positions, respectively.
Based on this investigation, we propose random feature aggregation (RFA) for
efficient identity and position embedding, serving as an extreme ablation study
regarding GNN feature aggregation. RFA (i) adopts a spectral-based GNN without
learnable parameters as its backbone, (ii) only uses random noises as inputs,
and (iii) derives embeddings via just one feed-forward propagation (FFP).
Inspired by degree-corrected spectral clustering, we further introduce a degree
correction mechanism to the GNN backbone. Surprisingly, our experiments
demonstrate that two variants of RFA with high- and low-pass filters can
respectively derive informative identity and position embeddings via just one
FFP (i.e., without any training). As a result, RFA can achieve a better
trade-off between quality and efficiency for both identity and position
embedding over various baselines.

Motivation: 现有神经网络求解器难以处理非线性二进制整数规划问题，而传统分支切割求解器因线性松弛导致计算复杂度高。

Method: 将非线性BIP问题转化为无约束、可微的多项式损失函数，利用超图神经网络进行端到端优化，并采用GPU加速和连续退火技术。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，BIPNN能高效生成高质量离散解，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: BIPNN为非线性BIP问题提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary (0-1) integer programming (BIP) is pivotal in scientific domains
requiring discrete decision-making. As the advance of AI computing, recent
works explore neural network-based solvers for integer linear programming (ILP)
problems. Yet, they lack scalability for tackling nonlinear challenges. To
handle nonlinearities, state-of-the-art Branch-and-Cut solvers employ linear
relaxations, leading to exponential growth in auxiliary variables and severe
computation limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose BIPNN
(Binary Integer Programming Neural Network), an unsupervised learning framework
to solve nonlinear BIP problems via hypergraph neural networks (HyperGNN).
Specifically, BIPNN reformulates BIPs-constrained, discrete, and nonlinear
(sin, log, exp) optimization problems-into unconstrained, differentiable, and
polynomial loss functions. The reformulation stems from the observation of a
precise one-to-one mapping between polynomial BIP objectives and hypergraph
structures, enabling the unsupervised training of HyperGNN to optimize BIP
problems in an end-to-end manner. On this basis, we propose a GPU-accelerated
and continuous-annealing-enhanced training pipeline for BIPNN. The pipeline
enables BIPNN to optimize large-scale nonlinear terms in BIPs fully in parallel
via straightforward gradient descent, thus significantly reducing the training
cost while ensuring the generation of discrete, high-quality solutions.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the
superiority of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于分数的扩散模型（SBDMs）因不完美分数估计导致下游蒙特卡洛估计偏差的问题，同时避免传统重要性采样（IS）的高计算成本。

Method: 通过最小化前向扩散和反向去噪轨迹之间的α-散度（α=2），调整预训练SBDM的每步噪声协方差，并分配轨迹级重要性权重。

Result: 在DW-4、LJ-13和alanine-dipeptide基准测试中，VT-DIS的有效样本量分别达到约80%、35%和3.5%，计算开销显著低于传统方法。

Conclusion: VT-DIS是一种高效且计算成本低的方法，能够显著提升蒙特卡洛估计的无偏性和样本效率。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for
Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream
Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this
bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow
ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively
costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned
Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that
adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the
$\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse
denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance
weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation
estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling.
On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective
sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using
only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS
or PF-ODE-based IS.

Conclusion: FedIV通过FedGMM成功实现了联邦环境下的工具变量分析，为分散数据提供了高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) analysis is an important applied tool for areas
such as healthcare and consumer economics. For IV analysis in high-dimensional
settings, the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) using deep neural networks
offers an efficient approach. With non-i.i.d. data sourced from scattered
decentralized clients, federated learning is a popular paradigm for training
the models while promising data privacy. However, to our knowledge, no
federated algorithm for either GMM or IV analysis exists to date. In this work,
we introduce federated instrumental variables analysis (FedIV) via federated
generalized method of moments (FedGMM). We formulate FedGMM as a federated
zero-sum game defined by a federated non-convex non-concave minimax
optimization problem, which is solved using federated gradient descent ascent
(FedGDA) algorithm. One key challenge arises in theoretically characterizing
the federated local optimality. To address this, we present properties and
existence results of clients' local equilibria via FedGDA limit points.
Thereby, we show that the federated solution consistently estimates the local
moment conditions of every participating client. The proposed algorithm is
backed by extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically
important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial
thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models
have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and
computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods.
Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean
simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the
slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural
ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive
graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with
ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework
tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex
dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling
relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations
confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S
and extreme event simulation. The codes are available at

Conclusion: 暂停标记是一种独立于思维链提示的机制，能显著增强Transformer的推理能力。

Abstract: Pause tokens, simple filler symbols such as "...", consistently improve
Transformer performance on both language and mathematical tasks, yet their
theoretical effect remains unexplained. We provide the first formal separation
result, proving that adding pause tokens to constant-depth, logarithmic-width
Transformers strictly increases their computational expressivity. With
bounded-precision activations, Transformers without pause tokens compute only a
strict subset of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ functions, while adding a polynomial number of
pause tokens allows them to express the entire class. For logarithmic-precision
Transformers, we show that adding pause tokens achieves expressivity equivalent
to $\mathsf{TC}^0$, matching known upper bounds. Empirically, we demonstrate
that two-layer causally masked Transformers can learn parity when supplied with
pause tokens, a function that they appear unable to learn without them. Our
results provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for prior empirical
findings, clarify how pause tokens interact with width, depth, and numeric
precision, and position them as a distinct mechanism, complementary to
chain-of-thought prompting, for enhancing Transformer reasoning.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models by
inducing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to input
data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data
like images, their application to tabular data presents new challenges. These
challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature
interdependencies in tabular data, which differ significantly from those in
image data. To address these differences, it is crucial to consider
imperceptibility as a key criterion specific to tabular data. Most current
research focuses primarily on achieving effective adversarial attacks, often
overlooking the importance of maintaining imperceptibility. To address this
gap, we propose a new benchmark for adversarial attacks on tabular data that
evaluates both effectiveness and imperceptibility. In this study, we assess the
effectiveness and imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks across four
models using eleven tabular datasets, including both mixed and numerical-only
datasets. Our analysis explores how these factors interact and influence the
overall performance of the attacks. We also compare the results across
different dataset types to understand the broader implications of these
findings. The findings from this benchmark provide valuable insights for
improving the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing the
field of adversarial machine learning on tabular data.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful class of algorithms for optimizing
expensive black-box functions, but designing effective BO algorithms remains a
manual, expertise-driven task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating scientific discovery, including
the automatic design of optimization algorithms. While prior work has used LLMs
within optimization loops or to generate non-BO algorithms, we tackle a new
challenge: Using LLMs to automatically generate full BO algorithm code. Our
framework uses an evolution strategy to guide an LLM in generating Python code
that preserves the key components of BO algorithms: An initial design, a
surrogate model, and an acquisition function. The LLM is prompted to produce
multiple candidate algorithms, which are evaluated on the established Black-Box
Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test suite from the COmparing Continuous
Optimizers (COCO) platform. Based on their performance, top candidates are
selected, combined, and mutated via controlled prompt variations, enabling
iterative refinement. Despite no additional fine-tuning, the LLM-generated
algorithms outperform state-of-the-art BO baselines in 19 (out of 24) BBOB
functions in dimension 5 and generalize well to higher dimensions, and
different tasks (from the Bayesmark framework). This work demonstrates that
LLMs can serve as algorithmic co-designers, offering a new paradigm for
automating BO development and accelerating the discovery of novel algorithmic
combinations. The source code is provided at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在适应性和覆盖性方面优于现有方法，且适用于大规模样本。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架显著提升了CP的适应性和覆盖性，同时提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular framework for constructing prediction
bands with valid coverage in finite samples, while being free of any
distributional assumption. A well-known limitation of conformal prediction is
the lack of adaptivity, although several works introduced practically efficient
alternate procedures. In this work, we build upon recent ideas that rely on
recasting the CP problem as a statistical learning problem, directly targeting
coverage and adaptivity. This statistical learning problem is based on
reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and kernel sum-of-squares (SoS)
methods. First, we extend previous results with a general representer theorem
and exhibit the dual formulation of the learning problem. Crucially, such dual
formulation can be solved efficiently by accelerated gradient methods with
several hundreds or thousands of samples, unlike previous strategies based on
off-the-shelf semidefinite programming algorithms. Second, we introduce a new
hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored specifically to target adaptivity
through bounds on test-conditional coverage. This strategy, based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), is introduced here to tune
kernel lengthscales in our framework, but has broader applicability since it
could be used in any CP algorithm where the score function is learned. Finally,
extensive experiments are conducted to show how our method compares to related
work. All figures can be reproduced with the accompanying code.

Abstract: Digital twins offer a promising solution to the lack of sufficient labeled
data in deep learning-based fault diagnosis by generating simulated data for
model training. However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world
systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied
in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis
framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables
knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain)
data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics
fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital
twin model and 90 real sequences collected from physical systems. The DANN
method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as
CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating
domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For
example, applying DANN to a baseline CNN model improves its accuracy from
70.00% to 80.22% on real-world test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
domain adaptation in bridging the sim-to-real gap.

*Pierre Houedry,Nicolas Courty,Florestan Martin-Baillon,Laetitia Chapel,Titouan Vayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeltaZero是一种新颖的可微分优化框架，用于将任意度量空间转化为最接近的树度量，通过平滑替代Gromov的δ-双曲性实现梯度优化，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将任意度量空间转化为树度量时，要么缺乏理论保证，要么表现一般，因此需要一种更高效且具有统计合理性的方法。

Method: DeltaZero利用平滑替代Gromov的δ-双曲性，通过梯度优化实现高效计算，并具有更好的最坏情况保证。

Result: 实验表明，DeltaZero在合成和真实数据集上均达到最优的失真率。

Conclusion: DeltaZero为解决度量空间到树度量的转化问题提供了一种高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful
framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data.
Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be
quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing
algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still
a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical
and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a
novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this
problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's
$\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a
tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from
a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is
justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于规则偏好建模的引导红队测试方法（RPG-RT），用于评估文本到图像（T2I）模型的安全性，通过迭代优化提示词并动态适应未知防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型可能生成有害内容，现有评估方法（白盒和黑盒）因依赖内部访问或特定防御机制知识而受限，亟需一种能适应未知防御的通用方法。

Method: 提出RPG-RT方法，利用LLM迭代修改提示词，结合T2I系统的反馈进行微调，并通过规则偏好建模细化反馈控制。

Result: 在19种T2I系统、3种商业API和T2V模型上验证了方法的优越性和实用性。

Conclusion: RPG-RT为评估T2I模型安全性提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，尤其在未知防御机制场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models raise ethical and safety concerns due to their
potential to generate inappropriate or harmful images. Evaluating these models'
security through red-teaming is vital, yet white-box approaches are limited by
their need for internal access, complicating their use with closed-source
models. Moreover, existing black-box methods often assume knowledge about the
model's specific defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in real-world
commercial API scenarios. A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and
diverse defense mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel
Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively
employs LLM to modify prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems
for fine-tuning the LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a
prior, enabling the LLM to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms.
Given that the feedback is often labeled and coarse-grained, making it
difficult to utilize directly, we further propose rule-based preference
modeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesired
feedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM's dynamic adaptation
process. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with varied safety
mechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models verify the
superiority and practicality of our approach.

TL;DR: NBL框架通过线性近似替代自注意力层，显著加速LLM推理，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于Transformer的LLM推理需求高的问题。

Method: 使用线性最小均方误差估计器生成线性近似，并通过典型相关分析计算误差上限，选择误差最小的层进行替换。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B上，推理速度提升32%，准确性损失小于1%。

Conclusion: NBL是一种无需微调的高效LLM推理加速方案。

Abstract: The high inference demands of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)
pose substantial challenges in their deployment. To this end, we introduce
Neural Block Linearization (NBL), a novel framework for accelerating
transformer model inference by replacing self-attention layers with linear
approximations derived from Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error estimators. NBL
leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis to compute a theoretical upper bound
on the approximation error. Then, we use this bound as a criterion for
substitution, selecting the LLM layers with the lowest linearization error. NBL
can be efficiently applied to pre-trained LLMs without the need for
fine-tuning. In experiments, NBL achieves notable computational speed-ups while
preserving competitive accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
applying NBL to 12 self-attention layers in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
increases the inference speed by 32% with less than 1% accuracy trade-off,
making it a flexible and promising solution to improve the inference efficiency
of LLMs.

### [272] [Improved Impossible Tuning and Lipschitz-Adaptive Universal Online Learning with Gradient Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21095)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的乐观在线镜像下降算法，解决了现有算法在梯度变化（GV）、通用在线学习（UOL）和Lipschitz适应性（LA）中性能不足的问题，首次实现了同时最优的GV和LA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习中，如何同时适应未知问题特性（如梯度变化、函数曲率和梯度尺度）并达到最优性能是一个主要挑战，现有算法存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 设计了一种带有辅助初始轮的乐观在线镜像下降算法，通过大学习率生成负项抵消间隙相关因子，解决了不可能调优问题。

Result: 新算法作为元算法，首次实现了同时最优的GV和LA性能，解决了GV界限与LA机制之间的冲突。

Conclusion: 该研究克服了先前工作的关键限制，解决了GV和LA之间的冲突，为在线学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: A central goal in online learning is to achieve adaptivity to unknown problem
characteristics, such as environmental changes captured by gradient variation
(GV), function curvature (universal online learning, UOL), and gradient scales
(Lipschitz adaptivity, LA). Simultaneously achieving these with optimal
performance is a major challenge, partly due to limitations in algorithms for
prediction with expert advice. These algorithms often serve as meta-algorithms
in online ensemble frameworks, and their sub-optimality hinders overall UOL
performance. Specifically, existing algorithms addressing the ``impossible
tuning'' issue incur an excess $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor in their regret bound
compared to the lower bound. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
optimistic online mirror descent algorithm with an auxiliary initial round
using large learning rates. This design enables a refined analysis where a
generated negative term cancels the gap-related factor, resolving the
impossible tuning issue up to $\log\log T$ factors. Leveraging our improved
algorithm as a meta-algorithm, we develop the first UOL algorithm that
simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art GV bounds and LA under standard
assumptions. Our UOL result overcomes key limitations of prior works, notably
resolving the conflict between LA mechanisms and regret analysis for GV bounds
-- an open problem highlighted by Xie et al.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)的方法，通过引入Rényi散度项修正CFG，并提出Gibbs采样方法，以在保持多样性的同时提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在提升条件扩散模型性能时，常导致样本多样性下降，存在质量与多样性的权衡问题。

Method: 分析了CFG的局限性，提出Rényi散度修正项，并设计Gibbs采样方法从目标分布中采样。

Result: 在图像和文本到音频生成任务中，新方法显著优于CFG。

Conclusion: 修正后的CFG方法在保持多样性的同时提升了样本质量，为条件扩散模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving
conditional diffusion models by linearly combining the outputs of conditional
and unconditional denoisers. While CFG enhances visual quality and improves
alignment with prompts, it often reduces sample diversity, leading to a
challenging trade-off between quality and diversity. To address this issue, we
make two key contributions. First, CFG generally does not correspond to a
well-defined denoising diffusion model (DDM). In particular, contrary to common
intuition, CFG does not yield samples from the target distribution associated
with the limiting CFG score as the noise level approaches zero -- where the
data distribution is tilted by a power $w \gt 1$ of the conditional
distribution. We identify the missing component: a R\'enyi divergence term that
acts as a repulsive force and is required to correct CFG and render it
consistent with a proper DDM. Our analysis shows that this correction term
vanishes in the low-noise limit. Second, motivated by this insight, we propose
a Gibbs-like sampling procedure to draw samples from the desired tilted
distribution. This method starts with an initial sample from the conditional
diffusion model without CFG and iteratively refines it, preserving diversity
while progressively enhancing sample quality. We evaluate our approach on both
image and text-to-audio generation tasks, demonstrating substantial
improvements over CFG across all considered metrics. The code is available at

Motivation: 强化学习中估计价值函数的不确定性对探索、安全决策和离线RL至关重要，但现有方法如深度集成计算成本高，单模型方法依赖启发式且效果有限。

Method: UVU通过在线学习器和固定随机初始化目标网络之间的预测误差平方量化不确定性，结合策略条件性价值不确定性。

Conclusion: UVU提供了一种计算高效且性能优异的不确定性估计方法，适用于强化学习的多种场景。

Abstract: Estimating epistemic uncertainty in value functions is a crucial challenge
for many aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), including efficient
exploration, safe decision-making, and offline RL. While deep ensembles provide
a robust method for quantifying value uncertainty, they come with significant
computational overhead. Single-model methods, while computationally favorable,
often rely on heuristics and typically require additional propagation
mechanisms for myopic uncertainty estimates. In this work we introduce
universal value-function uncertainties (UVU), which, similar in spirit to
random network distillation (RND), quantify uncertainty as squared prediction
errors between an online learner and a fixed, randomly initialized target
network. Unlike RND, UVU errors reflect policy-conditional value uncertainty,
incorporating the future uncertainties any given policy may encounter. This is
due to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained
using temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the
fixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical
analysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that
in the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to
the variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions.
Empirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on
challenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and
substantial computational savings.

Motivation: 标准高斯过程及其稀疏近似在大数据和异常值环境下存在计算可扩展性和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: RCaGP通过结合近似引入的不确定性的原则性处理和鲁棒广义贝叶斯更新，同时解决鲁棒性和计算感知问题。

Result: RCaGP提供了更保守和可靠的uncertainty估计，并在回归和高通量贝叶斯优化基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: RCaGP通过联合解决鲁棒性和计算感知问题，在大数据和异常值环境下表现优越。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and optimization
tasks such as Bayesian optimization (BO) due to their expressiveness and
principled uncertainty estimates. However, in settings with large datasets
corrupted by outliers, standard GPs and their sparse approximations struggle
with computational tractability and robustness. We introduce Robust
Computation-aware Gaussian Process (RCaGP), a novel GP model that jointly
addresses these challenges by combining a principled treatment of
approximation-induced uncertainty with robust generalized Bayesian updating.
The key insight is that robustness and approximation-awareness are not
orthogonal but intertwined: approximations can exacerbate the impact of
outliers, and mitigating one without the other is insufficient. Unlike previous
work that focuses narrowly on either robustness or approximation quality, RCaGP
combines both in a principled and scalable framework, thus effectively managing
both outliers and computational uncertainties introduced by approximations such
as low-rank matrix multiplications. Our model ensures more conservative and
reliable uncertainty estimates, a property we rigorously demonstrate.
Additionally, we establish a robustness property and show that the mean
function is key to preserving it, motivating a tailored model selection scheme
for robust mean functions. Empirical results confirm that solving these
challenges jointly leads to superior performance across both clean and
outlier-contaminated settings, both on regression and high-throughput Bayesian
optimization benchmarks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在信号恢复中表现出色，但现有研究局限于特定问题或无法处理非线性测量模型。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种只需一轮无条件采样和（部分）扩散模型逆运算的高效重建方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像数据集上比竞争方法更准确，且神经函数评估次数显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性测量模型下的信号恢复提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability to generate
diverse and high-quality images by efficiently modeling complex data
distributions. They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for
signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of
reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with
diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is
unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown
link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate
recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of
popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown}
link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only
requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs.
Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been
established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on
image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that
compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate
reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function
evaluations.

Result: SageAttention2++比FlashAttention快3.9倍，且精度与SageAttention2相同，适用于多种模型。

Conclusion: SageAttention2++显著加速注意力计算，对端到端指标影响可忽略。

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows
quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing
quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To
further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction
of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8
Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++
achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same
attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively
accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video
generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available

Conclusion: HeteroBA揭示了HGNNs的潜在漏洞，呼吁在多关系图场景中开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently drawn increasing
attention for modeling complex multi-relational data in domains such as
recommendation, finance, and social networks. While existing research has been
largely focused on enhancing HGNNs' predictive performance, their robustness
and security, especially under backdoor attacks, remain underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Backdoor Attack (HeteroBA) framework
for node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. HeteroBA inserts
carefully crafted trigger nodes with realistic features and targeted structural
connections, leveraging attention-based and clustering-based strategies to
select influential auxiliary nodes for effective trigger propagation, thereby
causing the model to misclassify specific nodes into a target label while
maintaining accuracy on clean data. Experimental results on three datasets and
various HGNN architectures demonstrate that HeteroBA achieves high attack
success rates with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Our method sheds light
on potential vulnerabilities in HGNNs and calls for more robust defenses
against backdoor threats in multi-relational graph scenarios.

Abstract: Phishing is a semantic attack which targets the user rather than the
computer. It is a new Internet crime in comparison with other forms such as
virus and hacking. Considering the damage phishing websites has caused to
various economies by collapsing organizations, stealing information and
financial diversion, various researchers have embarked on different ways of
detecting phishing websites but there has been no agreement about the best
algorithm to be used for prediction. This study is interested in integrating
the strengths of two algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-Class
Classification Rules based on Association Rules (MCAR) to establish a strong
and better means of predicting phishing websites. A total of 11,056 websites
were used from both PhishTank and yahoo directory to verify the effectiveness
of this approach. Feature extraction and rules generation were done by the MCAR
technique; classification and prediction were done by SVM technique. The result
showed that the technique achieved 98.30% classification accuracy with a
computation time of 2205.33s with minimum error rate. It showed a total of 98%
Area under the Curve (AUC) which showed the proportion of accuracy in
classifying phishing websites. The model showed 82.84% variance in the
prediction of phishing websites based on the coefficient of determination. The
use of two techniques together in detecting phishing websites produced a more
accurate result as it combined the strength of both techniques respectively.
This research work centralized on this advantage by building a hybrid of two
techniques to help produce a more accurate result.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，标记数据通常有限，标准共形预测（CP）会导致覆盖偏差和预测集过大。本文旨在扩展CP到半监督设置，利用未标记数据提升校准效果。

Method: 提出SemiCP方法，引入新的非一致性评分函数NNM，利用未标记数据的伪标签评分选择相似标记数据估计非一致性评分，并将其整合到校准过程中。

Result: 理论证明SemiCP在温和假设下提供渐近覆盖保证。实验表明该方法在有限校准数据下有效减少不稳定性和低效性，适用于条件覆盖设置，并能与现有CP方法无缝集成。

Conclusion: SemiCP通过半监督校准显著提升了共形预测在标记数据不足时的性能，为不确定性量化提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for uncertainty
quantification, providing prediction sets with coverage guarantees when
calibrated on sufficient labeled data. However, in real-world applications
where labeled data is often limited, standard CP can lead to coverage deviation
and output overly large prediction sets. In this paper, we extend CP to the
semi-supervised setting and propose SemiCP, leveraging both labeled data and
unlabeled data for calibration. Specifically, we introduce a novel
nonconformity score function, NNM, designed for unlabeled data. This function
selects labeled data with similar pseudo-label scores to estimate nonconformity
scores, integrating them into the calibration process to overcome sample size
limitations. We theoretically demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, SemiCP
provide asymptotically coverage guarantee for prediction sets. Extensive
experiments further validate that our approach effectively reduces instability
and inefficiency under limited calibration data, can be adapted to conditional
coverage settings, and integrates seamlessly with existing CP methods.

reliability and score consistency. It tracks running time, test errors, and

Abstract: Although \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{L}earning (LDL) has
promising representation capabilities for characterizing the polysemy of an
instance, the complexity and high cost of the label distribution annotation
lead to inexact in the construction of the label space. The existence of a
large number of inexact labels generates a label space with uncertainty, which
misleads the LDL algorithm to yield incorrect decisions. To alleviate this
problem, we model the uncertainty of label distributions by constructing a
\textbf{L}atent \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{G}rid (LLDG) to
form a low-noise representation space. Specifically, we first construct a label
correlation matrix based on the differences between labels, and then expand
each value of the matrix into a vector that obeys a Gaussian distribution, thus
building a LLDG to model the uncertainty of the label space. Finally, the LLDG
is reconstructed by the LLDG-Mixer to generate an accurate label distribution.
Note that we enforce a customized low-rank scheme on this grid, which assumes
that the label relations may be noisy and it needs to perform noise-reduction
with the help of a Tucker reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we attempt to
evaluate the effectiveness of the LLDG by considering its generation as an
upstream task to achieve the classification of the objects. Extensive
experimental results show that our approach performs competitively on several
benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统离线模仿学习通常忽略不良行为中的有用信号，本文旨在利用专家和不良行为的对比数据改进学习效果。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的目标函数，优化专家与不良行为状态-动作访问分布的KL散度差异，证明在专家数据占优时目标函数为凸。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在标准离线模仿学习基准上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一处理正负样本，避免了对抗训练，为离线模仿学习提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning typically learns from expert and unlabeled
demonstrations, yet often overlooks the valuable signal in explicitly
undesirable behaviors. In this work, we study offline imitation learning from
contrasting behaviors, where the dataset contains both expert and undesirable
demonstrations. We propose a novel formulation that optimizes a difference of
KL divergences over the state-action visitation distributions of expert and
undesirable (or bad) data. Although the resulting objective is a DC
(Difference-of-Convex) program, we prove that it becomes convex when expert
demonstrations outweigh undesirable demonstrations, enabling a practical and
stable non-adversarial training objective. Our method avoids adversarial
training and handles both positive and negative demonstrations in a unified
framework. Extensive experiments on standard offline imitation learning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型（LLMs）合成有害数据，但受限于其安全对齐机制，生成的数据在可靠性和多样性上存在问题。

Method: 采用模型众包策略，通过反事实方式生成大量良性数据作为基础模板，再将其分解为语义单元并逐单元毒化，最后通过动态模型切换进行细化。

Result: 实验表明，PoisonSwarm在合成多种有害数据类别时表现出色，具有高可扩展性和多样性。

Conclusion: PoisonSwarm为有害信息合成提供了一种高效且多样化的解决方案，适用于对抗性测试和安全防护开发。

Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data
is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards.
Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize
data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly
human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs,
the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability
and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information
synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing
strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success
rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in
a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into
multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final
refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful
data with high scalability and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决印度农业因资源压力和气候变化导致的低生产力问题，传统方法效果有限，计算工具如作物推荐系统提供了新思路。

Method: 使用环境和经济因素，19种作物和15个州的数据，开发并评估随机森林和SVM模型，采用10折交叉验证、时间序列分割和滞后变量方法。

Result: 10折交叉验证显示高准确率（RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%），但存在过拟合问题；时间序列分割和滞后变量方法提高了模型的实用性。

Conclusion: 滞后变量方法下的随机森林模型最适合印度农业的作物推荐，能更好地适应随时间变化的农业条件。

Abstract: Agriculture constitutes a primary source of food production, economic growth
and employment in India, but the sector is confronted with low farm
productivity and yields aggravated by increased pressure on natural resources
and adverse climate change variability. Efforts involving green revolution,
land irrigations, improved seeds and organic farming have yielded suboptimal
outcomes. The adoption of computational tools like crop recommendation systems
offers a new way to provide insights and help farmers tackle low productivity.
However, most agricultural recommendation systems in India focus narrowly on
environmental factors and regions, limiting accurate predictions of high-yield,
profitable crops. This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19
crops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models
using 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The
10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but
raised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting
real-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the
Time-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the
temporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in
improved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross
validation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag
Variable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies
and enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time.
Consequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the
Lag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation
in the Indian context.

Motivation: 化疗引起的血液毒性（如血小板减少）具有高度个体差异和预测困难，现有机制模型难以准确预测异常轨迹的患者。

Method: 开发了混合机制与数据驱动模型（如通用微分方程）以及纯数据驱动的非线性自回归外生模型（基于门控循环单元）。

Result: 数据驱动方法在数据充足时显著提升预测准确性，尤其对高风险患者；混合和机制模型在数据稀疏时表现更优。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法在个性化医疗中潜力巨大，而混合模型适用于数据有限场景，框架可推广至其他治疗相关毒性预测。

Abstract: Hematotoxicity, drug-induced damage to the blood-forming system, is a
frequent side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy and poses a significant
challenge in clinical practice due to its high inter-patient variability and
limited predictability. Current mechanistic models often struggle to accurately
forecast outcomes for patients with irregular or atypical trajectories. In this
study, we develop and compare hybrid mechanistic and data-driven approaches for
individualized time series modeling of platelet counts during chemotherapy. We
consider hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with neural networks,
known as universal differential equations. As a purely data-driven alternative,
we utilize a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model using gated recurrent
units as the underlying architecture. These models are evaluated across a range
of real patient scenarios, varying in data availability and sparsity, to assess
predictive performance. Our findings demonstrate that data-driven methods, when
provided with sufficient data, significantly improve prediction accuracy,
particularly for high-risk patients with irregular platelet dynamics. This
highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing clinical
decision-making. In contrast, hybrid and mechanistic models are superior in
scenarios with limited or sparse data. The proposed modeling and comparison
framework is generalizable and could be extended to predict other
treatment-related toxicities, offering broad applicability in personalized
medicine.

Conclusion: 平衡数据可靠性、激励兼容性和成本效率对实现可扩展且可信的联邦学习部署至关重要。

Abstract: In cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), client selection is critical to ensure
high model performance, yet it remains challenging due to data quality
decompensation, budget constraints, and incentive compatibility. As training
progresses, these factors exacerbate client heterogeneity and degrade global
performance. Most existing approaches treat these challenges in isolation,
making jointly optimizing multiple factors difficult. To address this, we
propose Shapley-Bid Reputation Optimized Federated Learning (SBRO-FL), a
unified framework integrating dynamic bidding, reputation modeling, and
cost-aware selection. Clients submit bids based on their perceived data
quality, and their contributions are evaluated using Shapley values to quantify
their marginal impact on the global model. A reputation system, inspired by
prospect theory, captures historical performance while penalizing
inconsistency. The client selection problem is formulated as a 0-1 integer
program that maximizes reputation-weighted utility under budget constraints.
Experiments on FashionMNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets show that
SBRO-FL improves accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness, even in
adversarial and low-bid interference scenarios. Our results highlight the
importance of balancing data reliability, incentive compatibility, and cost
efficiency to enable scalable and trustworthy FL deployments.

Abstract: Model merging dramatically reduces storage and computational resources by
combining multiple expert models into a single multi-task model. Although
recent model merging methods have shown promising results, they struggle to
maintain performance gains as the number of merged models increases. In this
paper, we investigate the key obstacles that limit the scalability of model
merging when integrating a large number of expert models. First, we prove that
there is an upper bound on model merging. Further theoretical analysis reveals
that the limited effective parameter space imposes a strict constraint on the
number of models that can be successfully merged. Gaussian Width shows that the
marginal benefit of merging additional models diminishes according to a
strictly concave function. This implies that the effective parameter space
becomes rapidly saturated as the number of merged models increases.
Furthermore, using Approximate Kinematics Theory, we prove the existence of a
unique optimal threshold beyond which adding more models does not yield
significant performance improvements. At the same time, we introduce a
straightforward Reparameterized Heavy-Tailed method (RHT) to extend the
coverage of the merged model, thereby enhancing its performance. Empirical
results on 12 benchmarks, including both knowledge-intensive and
general-purpose tasks, validate our theoretical analysis. We believe that these
results spark further research beyond the current scope of model merging. The

Motivation: 现实中的复杂多智能体强化学习任务通常难以通过零样本推理突破性能瓶颈，需要更高效的推理策略。

Method: 在推理阶段利用额外的时间和计算资源探索多次尝试，选择最优解。

Result: 在17个任务中平均提升45%，最高提升126%，仅需几秒额外执行时间。

Conclusion: 优化推理策略和执行时推理阶段是提升复杂多智能体强化学习性能的关键。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from
energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios
are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex
coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even
state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance
ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference.
Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference
phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple
attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an
inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding
inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in
complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up
to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during
execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported
by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies
for complex RL to date. Our experimental data and code are available at

Motivation: 传统基于结构预测置信度（如ipTM）的蛋白质结合剂设计方法存在梯度稀疏问题，且未能反映结合剂-靶标复合物的统计似然性。

Method: 提出pTMEnergy，一种从预测残基间误差分布中导出的统计能量函数，并将其整合到BECraft设计流程中，替代ipTM作为优化目标。

Result: BECraft在多个挑战性目标上优于BindCraft、RFDiffusion和ESM3，提高了结合剂成功率并减少结构冲突。pTMEnergy在虚拟筛选任务中达到新最优。

Conclusion: pTMEnergy和BECraft为蛋白质结合剂设计提供了更高效、更可靠的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Protein binder design has been transformed by hallucination-based methods
that optimize structure prediction confidence metrics, such as the interface
predicted TM-score (ipTM), via backpropagation. However, these metrics do not
reflect the statistical likelihood of a binder-target complex under the learned
distribution and yield sparse gradients for optimization. In this work, we
propose a method to extract such likelihoods from structure predictors by
reinterpreting their confidence outputs as an energy-based model (EBM). By
leveraging the Joint Energy-based Modeling (JEM) framework, we introduce
pTMEnergy, a statistical energy function derived from predicted inter-residue
error distributions. We incorporate pTMEnergy into BindEnergyCraft (BECraft), a
design pipeline that maintains the same optimization framework as BindCraft but
replaces ipTM with our energy-based objective. BECraft outperforms BindCraft,
RFDiffusion, and ESM3 across multiple challenging targets, achieving higher in
silico binder success rates while reducing structural clashes. Furthermore,
pTMEnergy establishes a new state-of-the-art in structure-based virtual
screening tasks for miniprotein and RNA aptamer binders.

Conclusion: CTNNs为下一代深度学习架构提供了一个理论严谨且实用的多尺度基础。

Abstract: We introduce copresheaf topological neural networks (CTNNs), a powerful and
unifying framework that encapsulates a wide spectrum of deep learning
architectures, designed to operate on structured data: including images, point
clouds, graphs, meshes, and topological manifolds. While deep learning has
profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous
systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific
tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open
challenges. CTNNs address this gap by grounding model design in the language of
copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes and subsumes
most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet
constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically
sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core
challenges in representation learning: long-range dependencies, oversmoothing,
heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured
data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional
baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized
sensitivity. These results underscore CTNNs as a principled, multi-scale
foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: LGKDE通过理论保证和实验验证，为图密度估计提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation
for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively
capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining
theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation
(KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has
unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of
kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each
graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn
the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by
maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed
perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features
and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal
density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence
guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error,
robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its
effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph
distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse
benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on
most benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 通过整合结构信息，GSAT能够自动学习节点邻域中不同边的注意力模式，从而丰富图表示。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing
data represented in graph structures, achieving remarkable success across a
wide range of applications. However, to further improve the performance on
graph classification benchmarks, structural representation of each node that
encodes rich local topological information in the neighbourhood of nodes is an
important type of feature that is often overlooked in the modeling. The
consequence of neglecting the structural information has resulted high number
of layers to connect messages from distant nodes which by itself produces other
problems such as oversmoothing. In the present paper, we leverage these
structural information that are modeled by anonymous random walks (ARWs) and
introduce graph structure attention network (GSAT) which is a generalization of
graph attention network(GAT) to integrate the original attribute and the
structural representation to enforce the model to automatically find patterns
for attending to different edges in the node neighbourhood to enrich graph
representation. Our experiments show GSAT slightly improves SOTA on some graph
classification benchmarks.

Result: LoFT显著缩小了基于适配器的调优与全微调之间的性能差距，且无需额外超参数调优。

Conclusion: LoFT是一种高效的低秩适应方法，性能优于标准LoRA，且不增加推理成本。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models are commonly adapted to downstream tasks using
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
which injects small trainable low-rank matrices instead of updating all
weights. While LoRA dramatically reduces trainable parameters with little
overhead, it can still underperform full fine-tuning in accuracy and often
converges more slowly. We introduce LoFT, a novel low-rank adaptation method
that behaves like full fine-tuning by aligning the optimizer's internal
dynamics with those of updating all model weights. LoFT not only learns weight
updates in a low-rank subspace (like LoRA) but also properly projects the
optimizer's first and second moments (Adam's momentum and variance) into the
same subspace, mirroring full-model updates. By aligning the low-rank update
itself with the full update, LoFT eliminates the need for tuning extra
hyperparameters, e.g., LoRA scaling factor $\alpha$. Empirically, this approach
substantially narrows the performance gap between adapter-based tuning and full
fine-tuning and consistently outperforms standard LoRA-style methods, all
without increasing inference cost.

Abstract: Understanding cellular responses to stimuli is crucial for biological
discovery and drug development. Transcriptomics provides interpretable,
gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features
but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share
biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their
utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to
enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using
weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene
expression representations with morphological information. To address data
scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal
distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art
results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel
augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving
inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power
and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal
representations for complex biological tasks.

Abstract: We present Bencher, a modular benchmarking framework for black-box
optimization that fundamentally decouples benchmark execution from optimization
logic. Unlike prior suites that focus on combining many benchmarks in a single
project, Bencher introduces a clean abstraction boundary: each benchmark is
isolated in its own virtual Python environment and accessed via a unified,
version-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) interface. This design eliminates
dependency conflicts and simplifies the integration of diverse, real-world
benchmarks, which often have complex and conflicting software requirements.
Bencher can be deployed locally or remotely via Docker or on high-performance
computing (HPC) clusters via Singularity, providing a containerized,
reproducible runtime for any benchmark. Its lightweight client requires minimal
setup and supports drop-in evaluation of 80 benchmarks across continuous,
categorical, and binary domains.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，UGCE显著提高了计算效率，同时保持高质量的解。

Conclusion: UGCE支持稳定性能，适应不同约束序列，并通过高效预热策略提升性能。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are a popular approach for interpreting
machine learning predictions by identifying minimal feature changes that alter
model outputs. However, in real-world settings, users often refine feasibility
constraints over time, requiring counterfactual generation to adapt
dynamically. Existing methods fail to support such iterative updates, instead
recomputing explanations from scratch with each change, an inefficient and
rigid approach. We propose User-Guided Incremental Counterfactual Exploration
(UGCE), a genetic algorithm-based framework that incrementally updates
counterfactuals in response to evolving user constraints. Experimental results
across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGCE significantly improves
computational efficiency while maintaining high-quality solutions compared to a
static, non-incremental approach. Our evaluation further shows that UGCE
supports stable performance under varying constraint sequences, benefits from
an efficient warm-start strategy, and reveals how different constraint types
may affect search behavior.

Conclusion: 研究为高维设置中学习低维结构提供了理论见解和实用方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of jointly learning a one-dimensional projection and
a univariate function in high-dimensional Gaussian models. Specifically, we
study predictors of the form $f(x)=\varphi^\star(\langle w^\star, x \rangle)$,
where both the direction $w^\star \in \mathcal{S}_{d-1}$, the sphere of
$\mathbb{R}^d$, and the function $\varphi^\star: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are
learned from Gaussian data. This setting captures a fundamental non-convex
problem at the intersection of representation learning and nonlinear
regression. We analyze the gradient flow dynamics of a natural alternating
scheme and prove convergence, with a rate controlled by the information
exponent reflecting the \textit{Gaussian regularity} of the function
$\varphi^\star$. Strikingly, our analysis shows that convergence still occurs
even when the initial direction is negatively correlated with the target. On
the practical side, we demonstrate that such joint learning can be effectively
implemented using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) adapted to the
structure of the problem, enabling efficient and flexible estimation of the
univariate function. Our results offer both theoretical insight and practical
methodology for learning low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional
settings.

Motivation: 当前方法仅预测最可能的后缀，但在高不确定性或高变异性场景下表现受限。

Result: U-ED-LSTM在不同数据集上表现良好，概率预测均值优于单点预测，且能有效捕捉不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了高不确定性场景下的预测能力，适用于复杂业务流程。

Abstract: Suffix prediction of business processes forecasts the remaining sequence of
events until process completion. Current approaches focus on predicting a
single, most likely suffix. However, if the future course of a process is
exposed to uncertainty or has high variability, the expressiveness of a single
suffix prediction can be limited. To address this limitation, we propose
probabilistic suffix prediction, a novel approach that approximates a
probability distribution of suffixes. The proposed approach is based on an
Uncertainty-Aware Encoder-Decoder LSTM (U-ED-LSTM) and a Monte Carlo (MC)
suffix sampling algorithm. We capture epistemic uncertainties via MC dropout
and aleatoric uncertainties as learned loss attenuation. This technical report
provides a detailed evaluation of the U-ED-LSTM's predictive performance and
assesses its calibration on four real-life event logs with three different
hyperparameter settings. The results show that i) the U-ED-LSTM has reasonable
predictive performance across various datasets, ii) aggregating probabilistic
suffix predictions into mean values can outperform most likely predictions,
particularly for rare prefixes or longer suffixes, and iii) the approach
effectively captures uncertainties present in event logs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了OVERT基准，用于评估文本到图像（T2I）模型的过度拒绝现象，发现该问题普遍存在，并探索了提示改写作为初步解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型的安全对齐策略可能导致过度拒绝良性提示，降低模型实用性，但缺乏系统性评估工具。

Method: 通过自动生成合成评估数据构建OVERT基准，包含4600个看似有害但良性的提示和1785个真正有害提示，评估多个T2I模型。

Result: 发现过度拒绝现象广泛存在，提示改写虽能缓解但可能损害原始提示的忠实性。

Conclusion: OVERT基准为T2I模型的安全对齐研究提供了工具，未来需进一步优化安全性与功能性的平衡。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating
visual content from text inputs. Although multiple safety alignment strategies
have been proposed to prevent harmful outputs, they often lead to overly
cautious behavior -- rejecting even benign prompts -- a phenomenon known as
$\textit{over-refusal}$ that reduces the practical utility of T2I models.
Despite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale
benchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this
paper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data,
resulting in OVERT ($\textbf{OVE}$r-$\textbf{R}$efusal evaluation on
$\textbf{T}$ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing
over-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful
but benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785
genuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety-utility
trade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that
over-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1),
underscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of
T2I models without compromising their functionality.As a preliminary attempt to
reduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often
compromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts. Finally, we
demonstrate the flexibility of our generation framework in accommodating
diverse safety requirements by generating customized evaluation data adapting
to user-defined policies.

additive model for competing risks survival analysis which extends the neural
additive architecture to model cause-specific hazards while preserving

Motivation: 探讨偏见缓解方法失败的原因，特别是子群定义对方法效果的影响。

Result: 子群选择显著影响性能，某些情况下使用特定子群反而恶化结果。

Conclusion: 子群定义是偏见缓解的关键因素，有时需用不同子群来实现公平性。

Abstract: Despite the constant development of new bias mitigation methods for machine
learning, no method consistently succeeds, and a fundamental question remains
unanswered: when and why do bias mitigation techniques fail? In this paper, we
hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step
shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To
investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification
tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse,
fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that
subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings
paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings
suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a
sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical
analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight
that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of
subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for
mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition
in bias mitigation and suggest it as a alternative lever for improving the
robustness and fairness of machine learning models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mixture of Decoders (MxDs)的方法，通过层级稀疏性改进多层感知机（MLPs）的可解释性和准确性，避免了神经元级稀疏性带来的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层感知机（MLPs）在大型语言模型中难以理解和编辑，现有稀疏方法虽可解释但牺牲了准确性。

Method: 采用层级稀疏性，引入MxDs方法，将预训练的密集层扩展为数千个专用子层，通过张量分解实现高稀疏性下的全秩权重。

Result: MxDs在3B参数的语言模型中显著优于现有方法（如Transcoders），在稀疏性和准确性上表现优越。

Conclusion: MxDs为设计既可解释又准确的分解方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are an integral part of large language models,
yet their dense representations render them difficult to understand, edit, and
steer. Recent methods learn interpretable approximations via neuron-level
sparsity, yet fail to faithfully reconstruct the original
mapping--significantly increasing model's next-token cross-entropy loss. In
this paper, we advocate for moving to layer-level sparsity to overcome the
accuracy trade-off in sparse layer approximation. Under this paradigm, we
introduce Mixture of Decoders (MxDs). MxDs generalize MLPs and Gated Linear
Units, expanding pre-trained dense layers into tens of thousands of specialized
sublayers. Through a flexible form of tensor factorization, each sparsely
activating MxD sublayer implements a linear transformation with full-rank
weights--preserving the original decoders' expressive capacity even under heavy
sparsity. Experimentally, we show that MxDs significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Transcoders) on the sparsity-accuracy frontier
in language models with up to 3B parameters. Further evaluations on sparse
probing and feature steering demonstrate that MxDs learn similarly specialized
features of natural language--opening up a promising new avenue for designing
interpretable yet faithful decompositions. Our code is included at:

standardized evaluation pipeline encompasses a wide range of metrics, enabling
a systematic assessment of the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of NA
methods. Through extensive comparative studies, we reveal practical insights

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOLLM是一种新型全局优化算法，通过分区搜索空间提升LLM驱动的采样效果，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在高维搜索空间或缺乏领域先验时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 将搜索空间分区为子区域，通过bandit机制选择子区域，LLM在子区域内生成候选点。

Result: 在标准优化基准测试中，HOLLM表现优于贝叶斯优化和全局LLM采样策略。

Conclusion: HOLLM有效提升了LLM在全局优化中的表现，无需领域知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as effective surrogate
models and candidate generators within global optimization frameworks for
expensive blackbox functions. Despite promising results, LLM-based methods
often struggle in high-dimensional search spaces or when lacking
domain-specific priors, leading to sparse or uninformative suggestions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose HOLLM, a novel global optimization
algorithm that enhances LLM-driven sampling by partitioning the search space
into promising subregions. Each subregion acts as a ``meta-arm'' selected via a
bandit-inspired scoring mechanism that effectively balances exploration and
exploitation. Within each selected subregion, an LLM then proposes high-quality
candidate points, without any explicit domain knowledge. Empirical evaluation
on standard optimization benchmarks shows that HOLLM consistently matches or
surpasses leading Bayesian optimization and trust-region methods, while
substantially outperforming global LLM-based sampling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决去中心化环境中LoRA方法的理论不足，尤其是梯度平滑性和模型共识干扰问题。

Method: 方法包括改进DLoRA的收敛速度，并引入DeCAF算法，结合截断奇异值分解（TSVD）来解决共识干扰。

Result: 理论分析显示TSVD的近似误差有界，共识差异随秩增加而消失。实验表明算法在视觉/语言任务中优于本地训练，并与联邦学习媲美。

Conclusion: 结论是DeCAF算法在去中心化环境中高效且具有理论保证，适用于IID和非IID数据分布。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most effective,
computationally tractable fine-tuning approaches for training Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA accomplishes this by
freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank
matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on
edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under
explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of
smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below).
This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match
the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also
introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular
value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus
interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded
and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases,
yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across
vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and
rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.

Conclusion: 为线性TD(λ)在更广泛场景下的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning
algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically
established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does
not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first
$L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary
features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional
assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward
settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from
arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result
featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.

Conclusion: 新算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，接近极小极大最优，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems proactively query users with relevant "key
terms" and leverage the feedback to elicit users' preferences for personalized
recommendations. Conversational contextual bandits, a prevalent approach in
this domain, aim to optimize preference learning by balancing exploitation and
exploration. However, several limitations hinder their effectiveness in
real-world scenarios. First, existing algorithms employ key term selection
strategies with insufficient exploration, often failing to thoroughly probe
users' preferences and resulting in suboptimal preference estimation. Second,
current algorithms typically rely on deterministic rules to initiate
conversations, causing unnecessary interactions when preferences are
well-understood and missed opportunities when preferences are uncertain. To
address these limitations, we propose three novel algorithms: CLiSK, CLiME, and
CLiSK-ME. CLiSK introduces smoothed key term contexts to enhance exploration in
preference learning, CLiME adaptively initiates conversations based on
preference uncertainty, and CLiSK-ME integrates both techniques. We
theoretically prove that all three algorithms achieve a tighter regret upper
bound of $O(\sqrt{dT\log{T}})$ with respect to the time horizon $T$, improving
upon existing methods. Additionally, we provide a matching lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ for conversational bandits, demonstrating that our
algorithms are nearly minimax optimal. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic
and real-world datasets show that our approaches achieve at least a 14.6%
improvement in cumulative regret.

Result: SquareχPO在差分隐私和鲁棒性方面取得最优结果，并首次在中心隐私模型下提供理论保证。

Conclusion: SquareχPO能同时处理隐私和噪声问题，且分析框架统一，具有独立的理论价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the offline alignment of language
models with human preference feedback, under both preference label corruption
and privacy protections. To this end, we propose Square$\chi$PO, a simple
one-line change to $\chi$PO where the standard log-loss is replaced by a new
square loss over probability. Thanks to the inherent properties of this new
loss, we have advanced the state-of-the-art of differentially private and
robust offline direct alignment. Specifically, for the local model of label
privacy, Square$\chi$PO is the first algorithm that attains an optimal rate
based on single-policy concentrability even with general function
approximations. It also gives the first result under the central model of
privacy protection over both prompts (responses) and labels. On the robustness
side against Huber label corruption, Square$\chi$PO is the first alignment
method that has a meaningful theoretical guarantee under general function
approximations. More importantly, Square$\chi$PO can address privacy protection
and corruption simultaneously, where an interesting separation is observed,
implying that the order of privacy and corruption matters. Furthermore, we show
that Square$\chi$PO can also be easily extended to handle the scenario of the
general preference model with state-of-the-art guarantees under corruption and
privacy. Last but not least, all of our theoretical guarantees enjoy a unified
analysis, building upon a new result on the generalization error bounds of
least-square regression under corruption and privacy constraints, which we
believe is of independent interest to the community.

Conclusion: 本文为扩散语言模型提供了理论支持，揭示了其实际有效性的信息论基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative
modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs).
Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to
faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite
their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model
approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence
guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic
perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of
iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens
in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and
lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our
convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the
practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D-NGD的方法，通过将自然梯度下降的计算从参数空间转移到更小的残差空间，显著降低了计算复杂度，并实现了在大规模PINN上的高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自然梯度方法在PINN训练中计算复杂度高（O(n^3)），难以扩展到大规模网络。

Method: 提出D-NGD方法，将Gauss--Newton步骤从参数空间转移到残差空间，并加入测地加速校正，提供直接求解器和预处理共轭梯度求解器。

Result: D-NGD成功扩展到1280万参数的PINN，相比一阶方法（Adam、SGD）和拟牛顿方法，最终误差降低了1-3个数量级。

Conclusion: D-NGD在单GPU上实现了大规模PINN的自然梯度训练，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Natural-gradient methods markedly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs), yet their Gauss--Newton update must be solved in the
parameter space, incurring a prohibitive $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where $n$ is
the number of network trainable weights. We show that exactly the same step can
instead be formulated in a generally smaller residual space of size $m =
\sum_{\gamma} N_{\gamma} d_{\gamma}$, where each residual class $\gamma$ (e.g.
PDE interior, boundary, initial data) contributes $N_{\gamma}$ collocation
points of output dimension $d_{\gamma}$.
  Building on this insight, we introduce \textit{Dual Natural Gradient Descent}
(D-NGD). D-NGD computes the Gauss--Newton step in residual space, augments it
with a geodesic-acceleration correction at negligible extra cost, and provides
both a dense direct solver for modest $m$ and a Nystrom-preconditioned
conjugate-gradient solver for larger $m$.
  Experimentally, D-NGD scales second-order PINN optimization to networks with
up to 12.8 million parameters, delivers one- to three-order-of-magnitude lower
final error $L^2$ than first-order methods (Adam, SGD) and quasi-Newton
methods, and -- crucially -- enables natural-gradient training of PINNs at this
scale on a single GPU.

vulnerabilities discovered through simulation. The introduced framework aids in
the development of precisely timed and targeted observation perturbations,
enabling researchers to assess adversarial attack outcomes within a strategic
decision-making context. We validate our framework, visualize agent behavior,
and evaluate adversarial outcomes within the context of a custom-built
strategic game, CyberStrike. Utilizing the proposed framework, we introduce a
method for systematically discovering and ranking the impact of attacks on
various observation indices and time-steps, and we conduct experiments to
evaluate the transferability of adversarial attacks across agent architectures
and DRL training algorithms. The findings underscore the critical need for
robust adversarial defense mechanisms to protect decision-making policies in
high-stakes environments.

TL;DR: 论文发现，传统因果不变性方法在分布偏移下可能不如经验风险最小化（ERM）表现好，且ERM在利用所有协变量时OOD泛化能力更强。作者将这一现象归因于隐藏混杂因素，并提出通过环境特定关系学习和混杂因素代理来提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究为设计鲁棒的OOD泛化算法和协变量选择策略提供了新理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Distribution shifts introduce uncertainty that undermines the robustness and
generalization capabilities of machine learning models. While conventional
wisdom suggests that learning causal-invariant representations enhances
robustness to such shifts, recent empirical studies present a counterintuitive
finding: (i) empirical risk minimization (ERM) can rival or even outperform
state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization methods, and (ii) its
OOD generalization performance improves when all available covariates, not just
causal ones, are utilized. Drawing on both empirical and theoretical evidence,
we attribute this phenomenon to hidden confounding. Shifts in hidden
confounding induce changes in data distributions that violate assumptions
commonly made by existing OOD generalization approaches. Under such conditions,
we prove that effective generalization requires learning environment-specific
relationships, rather than relying solely on invariant ones. Furthermore, we
show that models augmented with proxies for hidden confounders can mitigate the
challenges posed by hidden confounding shifts. These findings offer new
theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing robust OOD
generalization algorithms and principled covariate selection strategies.

Conclusion: 需更广泛的视角研究隐式正则化，动态权衡参数范数和锐度是解释泛化性能的关键。

Abstract: A widely believed explanation for the remarkable generalization capacities of
overparameterized neural networks is that the optimization algorithms used for
training induce an implicit bias towards benign solutions. To grasp this
theoretically, recent works examine gradient descent and its variants in
simplified training settings, often assuming vanishing learning rates. These
studies reveal various forms of implicit regularization, such as $\ell_1$-norm
minimizing parameters in regression and max-margin solutions in classification.
Concurrently, empirical findings show that moderate to large learning rates
exceeding standard stability thresholds lead to faster, albeit oscillatory,
convergence in the so-called Edge-of-Stability regime, and induce an implicit
bias towards minima of low sharpness (norm of training loss Hessian). In this
work, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of the generalization
performance of gradient descent requires analyzing the interaction between
these various forms of implicit regularization. We empirically demonstrate that
the learning rate balances between low parameter norm and low sharpness of the
trained model. We furthermore prove for diagonal linear networks trained on a
simple regression task that neither implicit bias alone minimizes the
generalization error. These findings demonstrate that focusing on a single
implicit bias is insufficient to explain good generalization, and they motivate
a broader view of implicit regularization that captures the dynamic trade-off
between norm and sharpness induced by non-negligible learning rates.

Result: 提出了一种在恒定恶意噪声率下工作的属性高效PAC学习算法，并开发了新的梯度分析方法处理稀疏约束。

Conclusion: 通过改进现有方法，实现了在噪声环境下高效学习稀疏半空间的目标。

Abstract: Attribute-efficient learning of sparse halfspaces has been a fundamental
problem in machine learning theory. In recent years, machine learning
algorithms are faced with prevalent data corruptions or even adversarial
attacks. It is of central interest to design efficient algorithms that are
robust to noise corruptions. In this paper, we consider that there exists a
constant amount of malicious noise in the data and the goal is to learn an
underlying $s$-sparse halfspace $w^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with $\text{poly}(s,\log
d)$ samples. Specifically, we follow a recent line of works and assume that the
underlying distribution satisfies a certain concentration condition and a
margin condition at the same time. Under such conditions, we show that
attribute-efficiency can be achieved by simple variants to existing hinge loss
minimization programs. Our key contribution includes: 1) an attribute-efficient
PAC learning algorithm that works under constant malicious noise rate; 2) a new
gradient analysis that carefully handles the sparsity constraint in hinge loss
minimization.

Result: 实验证明MTIF能高效准确地近似模型性能，其数据选择策略显著提升了MTL模型的性能。

Conclusion: MTIF建立了数据归因与MTL的新联系，为任务相关性测量和模型优化提供了高效细粒度的解决方案。

Abstract: Measuring task relatedness and mitigating negative transfer remain a critical
open challenge in Multitask Learning (MTL). This work extends data attribution
-- which quantifies the influence of individual training data points on model
predictions -- to MTL setting for measuring task relatedness. We propose the
MultiTask Influence Function (MTIF), a method that adapts influence functions
to MTL models with hard or soft parameter sharing. Compared to conventional
task relatedness measurements, MTIF provides a fine-grained, instance-level
relatedness measure beyond the entire-task level. This fine-grained relatedness
measure enables a data selection strategy to effectively mitigate negative
transfer in MTL. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the
proposed MTIF efficiently and accurately approximates the performance of models
trained on data subsets. Moreover, the data selection strategy enabled by MTIF
consistently improves model performance in MTL. Our work establishes a novel
connection between data attribution and MTL, offering an efficient and
fine-grained solution for measuring task relatedness and enhancing MTL models.

Abstract: Scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) increasingly depends
on methods that reduce reliance on human supervision. Reinforcement learning
from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability
limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers. Self-training,
where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a
compelling direction. We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning
algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness
signals and train without any ground-truth supervision. We apply the algorithm
to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches
performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly
on gold-standard answers. Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the
algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially
correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently
incorrect outputs are favored. Our results illustrate how self-supervised
improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels,
while also revealing its fundamental challenges.

Conclusion: CpSDE克服了现有数据限制，能够设计多种环肽，为药物开发提供了新工具。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides offer inherent advantages in pharmaceuticals. For example,
cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear
peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep
generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design, several
challenges prevent the development of computational methods for designing
diverse types of cyclic peptides. These challenges include the scarcity of 3D
structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the
geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of
non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we
introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative
structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type
predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these
two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates
the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond
modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in
designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable
stability and affinity.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种通用且高效的在线校准算法，并证明了校准误差的指数下界，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the online calibration of multi-dimensional forecasts over an
arbitrary convex set $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ relative to an
arbitrary norm $\Vert\cdot\Vert$. We connect this with the problem of external
regret minimization for online linear optimization, showing that if it is
possible to guarantee $O(\sqrt{\rho T})$ worst-case regret after $T$ rounds
when actions are drawn from $\mathcal{P}$ and losses are drawn from the dual
$\Vert \cdot \Vert_*$ unit norm ball, then it is also possible to obtain
$\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \exp(O(\rho /\epsilon^2))$ rounds.
When $\mathcal{P}$ is the $d$-dimensional simplex and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ is
the $\ell_1$-norm, the existence of $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$-regret algorithms for
learning with experts implies that it is possible to obtain
$\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \exp(O(\log{d}/\epsilon^2)) =
d^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ rounds, recovering a recent result of Peng (2025).
  Interestingly, our algorithm obtains this guarantee without requiring access
to any online linear optimization subroutine or knowledge of the optimal rate
$\rho$ -- in fact, our algorithm is identical for every setting of
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$. Instead, we show that the optimal
regularizer for the above OLO problem can be used to upper bound the above
calibration error by a swap regret, which we then minimize by running the
recent TreeSwap algorithm with Follow-The-Leader as a subroutine.
  Finally, we prove that any online calibration algorithm that guarantees
$\epsilon T$ $\ell_1$-calibration error over the $d$-dimensional simplex
requires $T \geq \exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ (assuming $d \geq
\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$). This strengthens the corresponding
$d^{\Omega(\log{1/\epsilon})}$ lower bound of Peng, and shows that an
exponential dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is necessary.

Motivation: 在模拟器模型中，似然函数的评估难以处理或计算成本过高，但可以通过参数值模拟模型输出，因此需要一种高效的后验推断方法。

Method: CPE利用归一化流（NF）近似后验分布，将模型的条件依赖结构融入神经网络，并提出了离散和连续的NF架构，以及一种连续情况下的常数时间采样方法。

Conclusion: CPE是一种高效且准确的模拟器模型后验推断方法，通过结合条件依赖结构和NF技术，显著提升了推断性能。

Abstract: We present Causal Posterior Estimation (CPE), a novel method for Bayesian
inference in simulator models, i.e., models where the evaluation of the
likelihood function is intractable or too computationally expensive, but where
one can simulate model outputs given parameter values. CPE utilizes a
normalizing flow-based (NF) approximation to the posterior distribution which
carefully incorporates the conditional dependence structure induced by the
graphical representation of the model into the neural network. Thereby it is
possible to improve the accuracy of the approximation. We introduce both
discrete and continuous NF architectures for CPE and propose a constant-time
sampling procedure for the continuous case which reduces the computational
complexity of drawing samples to O(1) as for discrete NFs. We show, through an
extensive experimental evaluation, that by incorporating the conditional
dependencies induced by the graphical model directly into the neural network,
rather than learning them from data, CPE is able to conduct highly accurate
posterior inference either outperforming or matching the state of the art in
the field.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在高斯分布下学习实值多索引模型（MIMs）的复杂性，提出了一种在对抗性标签噪声下学习MIMs的通用算法，并证明了其复杂性在维度上的定性最优性。


<details>

Motivation: 探索在高斯分布下学习MIMs的复杂性，特别是在对抗性噪声下的学习问题，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于平方损失的通用算法，适用于一类有界变差MIMs，并分析了其复杂性。同时，通过统计查询（SQ）下界证明算法的定性最优性。

Result: 在对抗性噪声下，算法的复杂性为d^{O(m)}2^{poly(K/ε)}；在可实现和独立噪声设置下，复杂性为d^{O(m)}2^{poly(K)}(1/ε)^{O(K)}。此外，证明了如果某些子空间不存在区分矩，则SQ学习器的复杂性必须为d^{Ω(m)}。

Conclusion: 该算法首次实现了对正齐次L-Lipschitz K-MIMs的高效学习，且复杂性独立于网络规模，显著改进了先前工作的指数依赖性。

Abstract: We study the complexity of learning real-valued Multi-Index Models (MIMs)
under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to
\mathbb{R}$ that depends only on the projection of its input onto a
$K$-dimensional subspace. We give a general algorithm for PAC learning a broad
class of MIMs with respect to the square loss, even in the presence of
adversarial label noise. Moreover, we establish a nearly matching Statistical
Query (SQ) lower bound, providing evidence that the complexity of our algorithm
is qualitatively optimal as a function of the dimension. Specifically, we
consider the class of bounded variation MIMs with the property that degree at
most $m$ distinguishing moments exist with respect to projections onto any
subspace. In the presence of adversarial label noise, the complexity of our
learning algorithm is $d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$. For the
realizable and independent noise settings, our algorithm incurs complexity
$d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K)}(1/\epsilon)^{O(K)}$. To complement our upper
bound, we show that if for some subspace degree-$m$ distinguishing moments do
not exist, then any SQ learner for the corresponding class of MIMs requires
complexity $d^{\Omega(m)}$. As an application, we give the first efficient
learner for the class of positive-homogeneous $L$-Lipschitz $K$-MIMs. The
resulting algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d)
2^{\mathrm{poly}(KL/\epsilon)}$. This gives a new PAC learning algorithm for
Lipschitz homogeneous ReLU networks with complexity independent of the network
size, removing the exponential dependence incurred in prior work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM解码在高批量和大上下文场景下，因KV缓存加载和顺序解码限制，导致延迟高且硬件利用率不足。

Method: 提出GTA（通过重用KV状态减少内存传输）和GLA（并行友好的潜在注意力，结合低级优化）。

Result: GTA在保持模型质量的同时减少一半KV缓存；GLA在解码速度和分片性上优于现有方法，吞吐量提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA和GLA通过硬件感知设计，显著提升解码效率，为大规模LLM服务提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: LLM decoding is bottlenecked for large batches and long contexts by loading
the key-value (KV) cache from high-bandwidth memory, which inflates per-token
latency, while the sequential nature of decoding limits parallelism. We analyze
the interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality
and question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This
work redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from
memory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel
scalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant
that combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers
without compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention
(GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations
for fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that
GTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the
KV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier
to shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for
example, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one.
Furthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end
latency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to
2$\times$.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has
led to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However,
this methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is
possible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,
healthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current
practical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,
this introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,
susceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the
verifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a
verifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead
uses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference
answer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,
in addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute
requirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on
extensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related
benchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple
perspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and
implicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/VeriFree.

Motivation: 颤音在表达情感和增强音乐深度中起关键作用，但其动态特性使其在歌唱声音转换中难以控制。

Method: 使用离散小波变换分解F0轮廓为频率成分，显式提取和操纵颤音。

Result: 实验表明，VibE-SVC能有效转换歌唱风格并保持说话人相似性，主客观评估均证实高质量转换。

Conclusion: VibE-SVC通过显式颤音控制，为歌唱声音转换提供了更高的灵活性和表现力。

Abstract: Controlling singing style is crucial for achieving an expressive and natural
singing voice. Among the various style factors, vibrato plays a key role in
conveying emotions and enhancing musical depth. However, modeling vibrato
remains challenging due to its dynamic nature, making it difficult to control
in singing voice conversion. To address this, we propose VibESVC, a
controllable singing voice conversion model that explicitly extracts and
manipulates vibrato using discrete wavelet transform. Unlike previous methods
that model vibrato implicitly, our approach decomposes the F0 contour into
frequency components, enabling precise transfer. This allows vibrato control
for enhanced flexibility. Experimental results show that VibE-SVC effectively
transforms singing styles while preserving speaker similarity. Both subjective
and objective evaluations confirm high-quality conversion.

focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity
across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the
direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model,
which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that
Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in
terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability.

Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity

Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are

Conclusion: 该工作通过平衡性能和效率，提升了声源定位在真实场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) is a critical technology for determining the
position of sound sources in complex environments. However, existing methods
face challenges such as high computational costs and precise calibration
requirements, limiting their deployment in dynamic or resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces a novel 3D SSL framework, which uses sparse
cross-attention, pretraining, and adaptive signal coherence metrics, to achieve
accurate and computationally efficient localization with fewer input
microphones. The framework is also fault-tolerant to unreliable or even unknown
microphone position inputs, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate its scalability for multi-source
localization without requiring additional hardware. This work advances SSL by
balancing the model's performance and efficiency and improving its robustness
for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 结论是自监督学习模型可以用于发音反演，但需要进一步优化以提高跨说话人的一致性。

Abstract: Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse
mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech
alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation
seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a
speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally.
Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models
provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate
whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce
articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English
and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which
extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a
training method which can improve inter-speaker consistency using only speech
data.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MelodySim是一种专注于旋律相似性的音乐相似性模型和数据集，用于抄袭检测。通过增强现有MIDI数据集并生成变体，结合用户研究验证数据质量，开发了基于MERT编码器和三元神经网络的模型，实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音乐抄袭检测中旋律相似性识别的问题，提供更精确的检测工具。

Method: 1. 通过增强Slakh2100数据集生成旋律保留的变体；2. 使用MERT编码器和三元神经网络构建模型。

Result: 模型在MelodySim测试集上表现出高准确率。

Conclusion: MelodySim为音乐抄袭检测提供了有效的旋律相似性分析工具。

Abstract: We propose MelodySim, a melody-aware music similarity model and dataset for
plagiarism detection. First, we introduce a novel method to construct a dataset
with focus on melodic similarity. By augmenting Slakh2100; an existing MIDI
dataset, we generate variations of each piece while preserving the melody
through modifications such as note splitting, arpeggiation, minor track dropout
(excluding bass), and re-instrumentation. A user study confirms that positive
pairs indeed contain similar melodies, with other musical tracks significantly
changed. Second, we develop a segment-wise melodic-similarity detection model
that uses a MERT encoder and applies a triplet neural network to capture
melodic similarity. The resultant decision matrix highlights where plagiarism
might occur. Our model achieves high accuracy on the MelodySim test set.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层分解框架HSM-TSS，通过全局-局部语义引导的特征分离和结构保持的声学重建，解决了目标音频源分离中联合建模声学-文本对齐和语义感知分离的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单阶段架构中联合建模声学-文本对齐和语义感知分离，且依赖大规模标注数据。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了HSM-TSS框架。

Method: HSM-TSS采用双阶段机制，先在全局语义特征空间进行分离，再在局部语义特征空间进行分离，并结合声学重建。还提出了指令处理流程解析文本查询。

Result: 该方法在数据高效训练下实现了最先进的分离性能，并在复杂听觉场景中保持了与查询的语义一致性。

Conclusion: HSM-TSS框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为自然语言查询的音频源分离提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Target audio source separation with natural language queries presents a
promising paradigm for extracting arbitrary audio events through arbitrary text
descriptions. Existing methods mainly face two challenges, the difficulty in
jointly modeling acoustic-textual alignment and semantic-aware separation
within a blindly-learned single-stage architecture, and the reliance on
large-scale accurately-labeled training data to compensate for inefficient
cross-modal learning and separation. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical decomposition framework, HSM-TSS, that decouples the task into
global-local semantic-guided feature separation and structure-preserving
acoustic reconstruction. Our approach introduces a dual-stage mechanism for
semantic separation, operating on distinct global and local semantic feature
spaces. We first perform global-semantic separation through a global semantic
feature space aligned with text queries. A Q-Audio architecture is employed to
align audio and text modalities, serving as pretrained global-semantic
encoders. Conditioned on the predicted global feature, we then perform the
second-stage local-semantic separation on AudioMAE features that preserve
time-frequency structures, followed by acoustic reconstruction. We also propose
an instruction processing pipeline to parse arbitrary text queries into
structured operations, extraction or removal, coupled with audio descriptions,
enabling flexible sound manipulation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
separation performance with data-efficient training while maintaining superior
semantic consistency with queries in complex auditory scenes.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练声学表示基础模型（FMs）在心音听诊中的表现，发现其性能与基线方法相当，其中自研CLAP模型的音频编码器表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练声学表示基础模型是否能够有效编码心音听诊信息，以提升非侵入性生命体征监测的准确性。

Method: 使用公开的心音图数据集和心率估计模型，对六种声学表示FMs进行分层分析，并与基线方法比较。

Result: 预训练FMs的表现与基线方法相当，自研CLAP模型的音频编码器在心率估计中表现最优，误差更低。

Conclusion: 预训练声学表示基础模型在心音听诊中具有潜力，尤其是自研CLAP模型，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that
provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic
representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights
into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of
the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM
representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG)
dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise
investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM,
Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP
model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024
(which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation
vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance
to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the
audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from
the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various
train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为'Model as Loss'的新训练范式，利用模型自身的编码器作为损失函数，提升语音增强的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工设计的损失函数或预训练的深度特征损失，难以捕捉信号的关键特性。

Method: 利用模型的编码器作为损失函数，通过任务特定的特征空间优化解码器输出。

Result: 在标准语音增强基准测试中优于预训练的深度特征损失，提供更好的感知质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 'Model as Loss'是一种有效的训练范式，能够提升语音增强任务的性能。

Abstract: Conventional methods for speech enhancement rely on handcrafted loss
functions (e.g., time or frequency domain losses) or deep feature losses (e.g.,
using WavLM or wav2vec), which often fail to capture subtle signal properties
essential for optimal performance. To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a
novel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss
function to guide the training.
  The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature
space, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and
task-relevant characteristics of the clean signal. By using the encoder's
learned features as a loss function, this framework enforces self-consistency
between the clean reference speech and the enhanced model output. Our approach
outperforms pre-trained deep feature losses on standard speech enhancement
benchmarks, offering better perceptual quality and robust generalization to
both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音质量评估依赖专家主观评分，存在变异性，需自动化客观方法。

Method: VOQANet利用语音基础模型提取声学特征，VOQANet+进一步结合手工声学特征。

Result: VOQANet+在噪声环境下表现更优，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合声学特征提升解释性和鲁棒性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Objective: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a critical role in
diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluation
of vocal function. Traditionally, this process relies on expert raters
utilizing standard scales, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation
of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain
(GRBAS). However, these metrics are inherently subjective and susceptible to
inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated and objective
assessment methods. Methods: We propose Voice Quality Assessment Network
(VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that
leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to capture high-level acoustic and
prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and
interpretability, we present VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic
features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM
embeddings. Results: Sentence-based input yields stronger performance than
vowel-based input, especially at the patient level. VOQANet consistently
outperforms baseline methods in RMSE and PCC, while VOQANet+ performs even
better and maintains robustness under noisy conditions. Conclusion: Combining
SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features improves interpretability
and resilience. Significance: VOQANet+ shows strong potential for deployment in
real-world and telehealth settings, addressing the limitations of subjective
perceptual assessments with an interpretable and noise-resilient solution.

Abstract: The performance of speaker verification systems is adversely affected by
speaker aging. However, due to challenges in data collection, particularly the
lack of sustained and large-scale longitudinal data for individuals, research

speakers and 67 Mandarin speakers) over several years, with the longest time
span reaching 17 years (approximately 900 weeks). For each speaker, the data
were recorded at weekly intervals. We studied the phenomenon of speaker aging
and its effects on advanced speaker verification systems, analyzed individual
speaker aging processes, and explored the impact of factors such as age group
and gender on speaker aging research.

Main category: q-bio.NC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在有限参与者数据下，如何优化从fMRI数据解码自然语音的策略，并评估多参与者训练和不同刺激对解码效果的影响。

Method: 使用深度神经网络预测LLM生成的文本表征，比较单参与者和多参与者训练的效果，分析不同刺激类型对解码的影响。

Result: 多参与者训练未提升解码准确性，解码器更擅长句法特征，复杂句法或丰富语义内容增加解码难度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，深层表型数据对解码更有效，多参与者数据可能需更大规模或更深层表型支持。

Abstract: We investigate optimal strategies for decoding perceived natural speech from
fMRI data acquired from a limited number of participants. Leveraging Lebel et
al. (2023)'s dataset of 8 participants, we first demonstrate the effectiveness
of training deep neural networks to predict LLM-derived text representations
from fMRI activity. Then, in this data regime, we observe that multi-subject
training does not improve decoding accuracy compared to single-subject
approach. Furthermore, training on similar or different stimuli across subjects
has a negligible effect on decoding accuracy. Finally, we find that our
decoders better model syntactic than semantic features, and that stories
containing sentences with complex syntax or rich semantic content are more
challenging to decode. While our results demonstrate the benefits of having
extensive data per participant (deep phenotyping), they suggest that leveraging
multi-subject for natural speech decoding likely requires deeper phenotyping or
a substantially larger cohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层网络能更准确地表示复杂的交互关系，但现有方法在识别超级传播者时存在局限性，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 利用图神经网络构建模型（TopSpreadersNetwork），通过模拟信息扩散生成数据集，并将任务转化为基于四维向量的排名预测问题。

Result: 在真实和合成多层网络上评估，TopSpreadersNetwork在识别高影响力节点方面表现优于传统方法和深度学习模型，且输出更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TopSpreadersNetwork为多层网络中的超级传播者识别提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence
maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if
selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively.
Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture
diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social),
and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in
such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a
dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to
the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to
multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the
ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies
each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the
duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and
(iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model,
TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom
aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data
and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our
model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning
methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and
synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves
superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering
improved interpretability through its structured output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统中心化社交平台中用户无法选择算法、个性化受限的问题。

Method: 在以太坊本地开发链上部署DeSocial框架，结合分布式数据存储、节点级共识和用户驱动的模型选择。

Result: 实验表明DeSocial在性能上优于五种经典中心化社交网络学习模型。

Conclusion: DeSocial展示了基于区块链的多节点验证和个性化算法选择的重要性，增强了用户在去中心化社交网络中的赋权。

Abstract: Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and
algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only
passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the
underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the
emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are
tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a
personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own
model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on
social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social
network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development
chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and
user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user
leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local
subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction
results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for
personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several
validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and
aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused
by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has
an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social
network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based
decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation
and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is

Conclusion: MVTN为多视角3D理解提供了灵活高效的解决方案，并开源了相关工具库MVTorch。

Abstract: Multi-view projection techniques have shown themselves to be highly effective
in achieving top-performing results in the recognition of 3D shapes. These
methods involve learning how to combine information from multiple view-points.
However, the camera view-points from which these views are obtained are often
fixed for all shapes. To overcome the static nature of current multi-view
techniques, we propose learning these view-points. Specifically, we introduce
the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN), which uses differentiable
rendering to determine optimal view-points for 3D shape recognition. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end with any multi-view network for 3D shape
classification. We integrate MVTN into a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that is capable of rendering both 3D meshes and point clouds. Our approach
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification and shape
retrieval on several benchmarks (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55).
Further analysis indicates that our approach exhibits improved robustness to
occlusion compared to other methods. We also investigate additional aspects of
MVTN, such as 2D pretraining and its use for segmentation. To support further
research in this area, we have released MVTorch, a PyTorch library for 3D
understanding and generation using multi-view projections.

Conclusion: SpatialLLM为城市智能分析提供了新视角，多领域知识、上下文长度和推理能力是关键影响因素。

Abstract: We propose SpatialLLM, a novel approach advancing spatial intelligence tasks
in complex urban scenes. Unlike previous methods requiring geographic analysis
tools or domain expertise, SpatialLLM is a unified language model directly
addressing various spatial intelligence tasks without any training,
fine-tuning, or expert intervention. The core of SpatialLLM lies in
constructing detailed and structured scene descriptions from raw spatial data
to prompt pre-trained LLMs for scene-based analysis. Extensive experiments show
that, with our designs, pretrained LLMs can accurately perceive spatial
distribution information and enable zero-shot execution of advanced spatial
intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic
management, etc. We argue that multi-field knowledge, context length, and
reasoning ability are key factors influencing LLM performances in urban
analysis. We hope that SpatialLLM will provide a novel viable perspective for
urban intelligent analysis and management. The code and dataset are available

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization
opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results
is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with
human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE
(DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized
differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their
relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key
components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an
autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a
strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting
networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each
stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework.
We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively
evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong
correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models,
and data.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了运动预测的准确性，还展示了通过训练适应场景上下文的能力，为实际应用提供了灵活性。

Abstract: Motion forecasts of road users (i.e., agents) vary in complexity as a
function of scene constraints and interactive behavior. We address this with a
multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that includes a retrocausal
flow of information. The corresponding tasks are to forecast (1) marginal
trajectory distributions for all modeled agents and (2) joint trajectory
distributions for interacting agents. Using a transformer model, we generate
the joint distributions by re-encoding marginal distributions followed by
pairwise modeling. This incorporates a retrocausal flow of information from
later points in marginal trajectories to earlier points in joint trajectories.
Per trajectory point, we model positional uncertainty using compressed
exponential power distributions. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the
Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, our method provides an interface for issuing
instructions through trajectory modifications. Our experiments show that
regular training of motion forecasting leads to the ability to follow
goal-based instructions and to adapt basic directional instructions to the
scene context. Code: https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion

Conclusion: CCL-LGS有效解决语义冲突并保持类别区分性，为3D语义理解提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models
have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability
critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality.
However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge:
cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and
view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via
projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields
and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation,
we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic
supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach
first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and
reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to
extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive
Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by
enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast
to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework
explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category
discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at

*Chenghao Qian,Wenjing Li,Yuhu Guo,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherEdit是一种新颖的天气编辑管道，用于在3D场景中生成可控类型和强度的逼真天气效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自动驾驶模拟提供多样且可控的天气效果，以应对恶劣天气条件下的测试需求。

Method: 分为天气背景编辑和天气粒子构建两部分：使用扩散模型生成2D天气背景，并通过TV注意力机制确保多帧和多视图的一致性；利用4D高斯场生成动态天气粒子。

Result: 在多个驾驶数据集上验证了WeatherEdit能够生成多样且可控的天气效果。

Conclusion: WeatherEdit展示了在自动驾驶模拟中生成逼真天气效果的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for
generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D
scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background
editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we
introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a
single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather
effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View
(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal
and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and
multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a
3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field
to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and
dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based
modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and
flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with
the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.
Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can
generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,
highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse
weather. See project page: https://jumponthemoon.github.io/w-edit

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and
accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a
bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge
solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up
recycling efforts and fostering the Green Deal. In response, we introduce
\textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to
accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer
materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered
high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning
the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and
424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded
electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material
classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of
baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep
learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and
the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for
further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material
identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting
across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification
robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI
dataset and accompanying codebase are openly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较两种肤色分类方法（ITA和基于$L^*$-$H^*$的方法）在面部情感分析系统中的公平性表现，发现肤色较暗的群体代表性不足，且ITA方法因对光照敏感而存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究肤色分类方法对面部情感分析系统公平性的影响，尤其是肤色较暗群体的代表性不足问题。

Method: 使用AffectNet数据集和MobileNet模型，比较ITA和$L^*$-$H^*$两种肤色分类方法，并通过F1-score、TPR等指标评估公平性。

Result: 肤色较暗群体代表性严重不足（约2%），且ITA方法因光照敏感性导致公平性差异较大，而$L^*$-$H^*$方法更一致。

Conclusion: 肤色测量方法的选择对公平性评估至关重要，ITA方法可能掩盖肤色较暗群体的差异，建议采用$L^*$-$H^*$方法并整合公平性评估模块。

Abstract: Understanding how facial affect analysis (FAA) systems perform across
different demographic groups requires reliable measurement of sensitive
attributes such as ancestry, often approximated by skin tone, which itself is
highly influenced by lighting conditions. This study compares two objective
skin tone classification methods: the widely used Individual Typology Angle
(ITA) and a perceptually grounded alternative based on Lightness ($L^*$) and
Hue ($H^*$). Using AffectNet and a MobileNet-based model, we assess fairness
across skin tone groups defined by each method. Results reveal a severe
underrepresentation of dark skin tones ($\sim 2 \%$), alongside fairness
disparities in F1-score (up to 0.08) and TPR (up to 0.11) across groups. While
ITA shows limitations due to its sensitivity to lighting, the $H^*$-$L^*$
method yields more consistent subgrouping and enables clearer diagnostics
through metrics such as Equal Opportunity. Grad-CAM analysis further highlights
differences in model attention patterns by skin tone, suggesting variation in
feature encoding. To support future mitigation efforts, we also propose a
modular fairness-aware pipeline that integrates perceptual skin tone
estimation, model interpretability, and fairness evaluation. These findings
emphasize the relevance of skin tone measurement choices in fairness assessment
and suggest that ITA-based evaluations may overlook disparities affecting
darker-skinned individuals.

Motivation: 现有方法通过添加模块防止过拟合，但可能阻碍经验风险最小化（ERM）目标的优化，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过扰动模型参数，对齐跨域梯度更新，保留域不变特征并管理域特定特征。

Result: 在多个深度伪造检测数据集上，该方法优于现有域泛化技术。

Conclusion: 梯度对齐策略有效提升了模型对域偏移的鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in domain generalization for deepfake detection have
attracted significant attention, with previous methods often incorporating
additional modules to prevent overfitting to domain-specific patterns. However,
such regularization can hinder the optimization of the empirical risk
minimization (ERM) objective, ultimately degrading model performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel learning objective that aligns generalization
gradient updates with ERM gradient updates. The key innovation is the
application of perturbations to model parameters, aligning the ascending points
across domains, which specifically enhances the robustness of deepfake
detection models to domain shifts. This approach effectively preserves
domain-invariant features while managing domain-specific characteristics,
without introducing additional regularization. Experimental results on multiple
challenging deepfake detection datasets demonstrate that our gradient alignment
strategy outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques,
confirming the efficacy of our method. The code is available at

Conclusion: 首次将VLM推理整合到EVT中，为动态非结构化环境中的机器人应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-improving framework that enhances Embodied Visual
Tracking (EVT) with Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to address the limitations of
current active visual tracking systems in recovering from tracking failure. Our
approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs'
reasoning capabilities, deploying a fast visual policy for normal tracking and
activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a
memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to
progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing
VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates
by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based
methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration
of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery,
offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视觉理解和任务特定能力整合方面存在不足，阻碍其成为真正通用的视觉模型。

Method: 引入了一种人类化的理解-思考-回答过程，使模型能单次完成推理，无需多次推断或外部工具。

Result: Griffon-R在复杂视觉推理基准（如VSR和CLEVR）上表现优异，并在多模态任务（如MMBench和ScienceQA）中提升了能力。

Conclusion: Griffon-R通过统一的视觉推理机制，填补了基础视觉能力与通用问答之间的差距，并提供了可追踪的复杂视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable visual
understanding performance on both vision-language and vision-centric tasks.
However, they often fall short in integrating advanced, task-specific
capabilities for compositional reasoning, which hinders their progress toward
truly competent general vision models. To address this, we present a unified
visual reasoning mechanism that enables LMMs to solve complicated compositional
problems by leveraging their intrinsic capabilities (e.g. grounding and visual
understanding capabilities). Different from the previous shortcut learning
mechanism, our approach introduces a human-like
understanding-thinking-answering process, allowing the model to complete all
steps in a single pass forwarding without the need for multiple inferences or
external tools. This design bridges the gap between foundational visual
capabilities and general question answering, encouraging LMMs to generate
faithful and traceable responses for complex visual reasoning. Meanwhile, we
curate 334K visual instruction samples covering both general scenes and
text-rich scenes and involving multiple foundational visual capabilities. Our
trained model, Griffon-R, has the ability of end-to-end automatic
understanding, self-thinking, and reasoning answers. Comprehensive experiments
show that Griffon-R not only achieves advancing performance on complex visual
reasoning benchmarks including VSR and CLEVR, but also enhances multimodal
capabilities across various benchmarks like MMBench and ScienceQA. Data,

TL;DR: PARTONOMY是一个用于像素级部分定位的LMM基准测试，揭示了现有LMM在部分定位能力上的不足，并提出PLUM模型以改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的物体由独特的、特定于对象的部分组成，识别这些部分对细粒度组合推理至关重要，但现有LMM在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 通过构建PARTONOMY基准测试，涵盖862个部分标签和534个对象标签，并提出PLUM模型，采用跨度标记和反馈循环机制。

Result: 实验显示现有LMM（如LISA-13B）表现较差（5.9% gIoU），PLUM在多个任务上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: PLUM为LMM的细粒度视觉理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts.
Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional
reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this
seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM
benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from
existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images,
encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike
existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY
uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models
to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify
textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate
significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only
5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We
note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key
architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during
pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted
segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To
address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose
PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation
tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find
that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning
segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM
finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive
with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work
opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual
understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language
and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,
autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of
these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that
constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated
affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is
fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part
segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the
performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks
within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for
state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,
we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement
through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to
facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the
applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的SVG生成方法RLRF，通过渲染反馈提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的SVG生成方法在训练过程中未观察渲染图像，导致生成结果不够准确和高效。

Method: 引入RLRF方法，利用渲染后的SVG与原图的视觉保真度反馈，通过强化学习优化生成过程。

Result: RLRF显著优于监督微调，能生成更准确、高效且语义连贯的SVG。

Conclusion: RLRF通过渲染反馈解决了现有方法的不足，实现了高质量的SVG生成。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) offer a powerful format for representing
visual designs as interpretable code. Recent advances in vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a
code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are
particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and
fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision,
natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often
struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the
rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for
autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can
still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for
reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from
Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in
autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an
input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared
to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides
the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent
SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common
failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong
structural understanding and generalization.

in-context learning. By using examples in a prompt as well as a query, they are
capable of performing tasks such as few-shot, one-shot, or zero-shot learning

that these transformer models have been shown to be capable of learning the
general class of certain functions, such as linear functions and small 2-layer
neural networks, on random data (Garg et al, 2023). We aim to extend this to
the image space to analyze their capability to in-context learn more complex

Conclusion: 论文强调了少样本对齐的重要性，并提供了数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve
remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck,
and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize
to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically
found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual
data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation
instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To
this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100
multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found
in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in
zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing
for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like
GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on
challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the
need for few-shot concept alignment. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: CoDA是一个基于频率组合的框架，统一了模型压缩和域适应，通过量化感知训练和测试时适应，显著提升了压缩模型在域转移场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代设备上神经网络应用在资源受限和域转移不可预测的双重挑战，此前工作仅单独处理压缩或域适应问题。

Method: 采用量化感知训练（QAT）和测试时适应（TTA），利用低频分量学习通用特征，高频分量作为域特定线索。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C和ImageNet-C上，压缩模型分别提升了7.96%和5.37%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoDA有效统一了压缩和域适应，显著提升了模型在域转移下的性能，且兼容现有方法。

Abstract: Modern on-device neural network applications must operate under resource
constraints while adapting to unpredictable domain shifts. However, this
combined challenge-model compression and domain adaptation-remains largely
unaddressed, as prior work has tackled each issue in isolation: compressed
networks prioritize efficiency within a fixed domain, whereas large, capable
models focus on handling domain shifts. In this work, we propose CoDA, a
frequency composition-based framework that unifies compression and domain
adaptation. During training, CoDA employs quantization-aware training (QAT)
with low-frequency components, enabling a compressed model to selectively learn
robust, generalizable features. At test time, it refines the compact model in a
source-free manner (i.e., test-time adaptation, TTA), leveraging the
full-frequency information from incoming data to adapt to target domains while
treating high-frequency components as domain-specific cues. LFC are aligned
with the trained distribution, while HFC unique to the target distribution are
solely utilized for batch normalization. CoDA can be integrated synergistically
into existing QAT and TTA methods. CoDA is evaluated on widely used
domain-shift benchmarks, including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, across various
model architectures. With significant compression, it achieves accuracy
improvements of 7.96%p on CIFAR10-C and 5.37%p on ImageNet-C over the
full-precision TTA baseline.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言的适应性想象方法（ATD），通过双分支自引导想象策略，结合大型语言模型（LLM），在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中实现更高效和可靠的导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中，部分可观测性导致感知与语言对齐困难，现有方法依赖视觉合成，计算成本高且冗余。

Method: 提出Adaptive Text Dreamer（ATD），采用双分支自引导想象策略，结合LLM的左右脑架构（左脑逻辑整合，右脑想象预测），仅微调Q-former以激活领域知识，并引入交叉交互机制优化想象输出。

Result: 在R2R基准测试中，ATD以较少参数实现最优性能。

Conclusion: ATD通过语言形式的适应性想象，显著提升了VLN任务的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by
following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult
to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining
future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high
computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively
imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more
reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive
Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a
large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain
architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the
right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To
achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently
activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of
logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce
a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject
them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the
reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We
conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is

TL;DR: MUSEG是一种基于强化学习的方法，通过引入时间戳感知的多段定位，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频中的细粒度时间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视频时间推理方面表现不足，尽管强化学习（RL）被尝试用于解决这一问题，但现有方法效果有限。

Method: MUSEG通过多段定位和时间感知的强化学习训练策略，逐步引导模型进行时间推理。

Result: 实验表明，MUSEG在时间定位和时间敏感视频问答任务中显著优于现有方法，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MUSEG为视频时间理解提供了一种有效的解决方案，推动了MLLMs在时间推理方面的进展。

Abstract: Video temporal understanding is crucial for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to reason over events in videos. Despite recent advances in general
video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal
reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this
issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this
work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal
understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG
enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting
more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we
design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively
guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on
temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG
significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse
temporal understanding scenarios. View our project at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的时空场景挖掘方法RefAV，用于从自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的驾驶日志中识别和定位安全关键场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景挖掘技术依赖手工查询，效率低且易出错，而自动驾驶车辆生成的海量数据需要更高效的方法来识别关键场景。

Method: 引入RefAV数据集，包含10,000个自然语言查询，描述复杂多智能体交互，并评估多种多目标跟踪器。

Result: 研究发现，直接使用现成的VLMs效果不佳，表明场景挖掘具有独特挑战。

Conclusion: RefAV为场景挖掘提供了新方法，但需进一步优化VLMs以适应特定需求。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal
data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying
interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time
and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset
of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent
interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object
trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find
that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting
that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: ControlTac是一个两阶段可控框架，通过参考触觉图像、接触力和接触位置生成逼真的触觉图像，用于数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决触觉数据收集成本高、现有方法生成结果不真实且难以迁移的问题。

Method: 提出ControlTac框架，利用物理先验作为控制输入生成逼真触觉图像。

Result: 实验证明ControlTac能有效增强触觉数据集并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ControlTac具有实际应用价值，能生成多样且物理合理的触觉图像。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception,
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale
tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object
interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches
to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation,
often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstream
tasks.To address this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable
framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single
reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those
physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and
varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through
experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can
effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three
real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach.

TL;DR: ID-Align通过重新排序位置ID，解决了高分辨率图像和缩略图之间交互受限的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法同时编码高分辨率和缩略图图像，但RoPE的长程衰减特性阻碍了高分辨率与缩略图之间以及文本与图像之间的交互。

Method: 提出ID-Align，通过重新分配位置ID，使高分辨率标记继承对应缩略图标记的ID，并限制位置索引的过度扩展。

Result: 在LLaVA-Next框架下，ID-Align在MMBench关系推理任务上提升了6.09%，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: ID-Align有效解决了高分辨率与缩略图交互问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Currently, a prevalent approach for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
performance is to encode both the high-resolution version and the thumbnail of
an image simultaneously. While effective, this method generates a large number
of image tokens. When combined with the widely used Rotary Position Embedding
(RoPE), its long-term decay property hinders the interaction between
high-resolution tokens and thumbnail tokens, as well as between text and image.
To address these issues, we propose ID-Align, which alleviates these problems
by reordering position IDs. In this method, high-resolution tokens inherit IDs
from their corresponding thumbnail token while constraining the overexpansion
of positional indices. Our experiments conducted within the LLaVA-Next
framework demonstrate that ID-Align achieves significant improvements,
including a 6.09% enhancement on MMBench's relation reasoning tasks and notable
gains across multiple benchmarks. Our code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: CAAC框架通过视觉标记校准和自适应注意力重缩放，有效减少大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但常出现幻觉问题，即描述图像中不存在的对象或属性。现有推理时干预方法在开放和长文本生成场景中难以保持准确性。

Method: CAAC框架通过两步方法解决：视觉标记校准（VTC）平衡视觉标记的注意力，自适应注意力重缩放（AAR）基于模型置信度增强视觉基础。

Result: 在CHAIR、AMBER和POPE基准测试中，CAAC表现优于基线方法，尤其在长文本生成中显著减少幻觉。

Conclusion: CAAC通过置信度驱动的调整，有效提升视觉对齐，减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on
multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe
objects or attributes not present in the image. Current inference-time
interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended
and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention
Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key
biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately
across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to
textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token
Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive
Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's
confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual
alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks
demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form
generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

Motivation: 预测OSA患者五年内发展为高血压的复杂性，以及现有方法的局限性，促使研究者开发一种更准确的预测模型。

Method: 研究提出了一种深度学习方法，通过DCT将多导睡眠图信号转换为频域表示，并结合预训练的2D神经网络（如MobileNet、EfficientNet和ResNet）进行特征提取和预测。

Result: 模型在预测OSA患者五年内高血压风险时，取得了72.88%的AUC，表明频域特征提取和迁移学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了频域特征提取和迁移学习在医疗数据有限的情况下，能够有效提升高血压风险预测的准确性。

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significant risk factor for hypertension,
primarily due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Predicting
whether individuals with OSA will develop hypertension within five years
remains a complex challenge. This study introduces a novel deep learning
approach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer
learning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all
polysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their
collective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted
from these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize
pre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet
variants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which
transforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving
essential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing
robustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer
learning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it
leverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve
generalization. By strategically placing the DCT layer at deeper truncation
depths within EfficientNet, our model achieved a best area under the curve
(AUC) of 72.88%, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain feature
extraction and transfer learning in predicting hypertension risk in OSA
patients over a five-year period.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过微调将视觉条件添加到文本到视频基础模型中，资源消耗大且仅限于预定义条件设置。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出FlexTI2V方法，通过将条件图像反转为潜在空间中的噪声表示，并在去噪过程中采用随机块交换策略和动态控制机制，实现灵活的图像条件融入。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于其他无需训练的视觉条件方法，并在保真度和创造性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: FlexTI2V为文本图像到视频生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，无需额外训练即可实现多样化的视觉条件控制。

Abstract: Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable
video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing
methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation
models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few
predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified
formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can
condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary
positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy
representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models,
our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual
features into video representations through local image patches. To balance
creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the
strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments
validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning
methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by
detailed ablation study and analysis.

Motivation: 解决学术海报生成中长文本压缩和视觉一致性的挑战。

Result: 开源模型性能优于GPT-4o，成本更低，生成速度快且质量高。

Conclusion: 为下一代自动化海报生成模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific
communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents
into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce
the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent
conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on
(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual
Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic
and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably
(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by
VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose
PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser
distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns
text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and
spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by
executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and
ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o
outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and
poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary
aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual
semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the
Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across
nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper
into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These
findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated
poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 深度神经网络的内部表示难以解释，现有方法依赖粗糙近似，需要更精确的映射方法。

Method: 采用预训练的高保真条件扩散模型，结合空间分辨特征图，实现特征空间到输入空间的概率映射。

Result: 在多种预训练图像分类器（如CNN和ViT）上验证了方法的可行性，展示了出色的重建能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机视觉模型的特征空间理解提供了广泛潜力，支持概念可视化等应用。

Abstract: Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks,
such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to
interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting
the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose
using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion
model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping
in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing
excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and
robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications,
such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations
of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential
for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在自我中心视角任务中表现良好，但在跨视角空间推理任务中存在局限性，需要新的评估方法和改进。

Method: 引入ViewSpatial-Bench基准，包含五种任务类型，并通过自动化3D标注生成精确方向标签；对多种VLMs进行评估，并通过微调改进模型性能。

Conclusion: ViewSpatial-Bench为空间智能提供了关键基准，证明建模3D空间关系能显著提升VLMs的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges
persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning.
We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric
spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to
allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of
reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition
evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D
annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive
evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant
performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on
camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a
human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset,
we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks,
highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial
benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides
empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs'
corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

Conclusion: RainFusion是一种即插即用的高效方法，适用于现有3D注意力视频生成模型。

Abstract: Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive,
with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over
80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf
RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits
inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation
while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse
patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal
Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is
determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our
proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed
{\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated
into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional
training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models
including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its
broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that
RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation
while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores

Motivation: 现有方法如RLHF和DPO容易过拟合文本信息或加剧幻觉，而负样本增强仅部分解决问题。LPOI填补了列表偏好优化在VLM中的空白。

Method: LPOI通过掩码图像中的关键对象，并在正负样本间插值掩码区域，生成渐进完整图像序列，训练模型按对象可见性排序。

Result: 在MMHalBench、AMBER和Object HalBench上的实验表明，LPOI在减少幻觉和提升VLM性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LPOI无需额外标注，通过自动构建排序列表有效减少VLM的幻觉，是列表偏好优化在VLM中的首次成功应用。

Abstract: Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods
like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate
hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses
these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for
VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In
this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference
optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and
masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region
between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally
more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending
order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining
visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise
preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object
masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and
Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization
methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance. We make the
code available at https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/lpoi.

Result: 在标准视频基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的性能，缩小了真实与蒸馏视频数据之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频数据集压缩提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for dataset
compression, enabling the synthesis of compact surrogate datasets that
approximate the training utility of large-scale ones. While significant
progress has been achieved in distilling image datasets, extending DD to the
video domain remains challenging due to the high dimensionality and temporal
complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods
often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve
temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically
lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video
dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with
respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance
motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering
mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation
process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while
suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable
solution for video dataset compression.

Conclusion: LeDiFlow通过优化先验分布和路径设计，显著提升了FM模型的效率和生成质量，为高效图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion
Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the
process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling
paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based
one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior,
which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and
target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls
to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned
Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for
training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior
distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing
the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow
enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These
paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image
generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained
on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably
outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly
on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the
corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model
enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.

TL;DR: ConText-CIR框架通过Text Concept-Consistency损失和合成数据生成管道，提升了组合图像检索（CIR）任务的性能，在多个基准数据集上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法在图像和文本修改的表示上表现不佳，导致检索性能不理想。

Method: 提出ConText-CIR框架，结合Text Concept-Consistency损失和合成数据生成管道。

Result: 在CIRR和CIRCO等数据集上实现了监督和零样本设置下的新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ConText-CIR通过改进表示学习和数据生成，显著提升了CIR任务的性能。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image
specified by a query image and a relative text that describes a semantic
modification to the query image. Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately
represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained
with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of
noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of
the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a
synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR
datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable
stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed
image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple
benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO. Source code, model checkpoints,
and our new datasets are available at https://github.com/mvrl/ConText-CIR.

TL;DR: MetaSlot是一种改进的Slot Attention变体，通过动态适应对象数量，解决了传统方法中固定槽数导致的问题，提升了对象表示的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对象中心学习方法（OCL）依赖固定槽数，导致对象数量变化时表示不准确。MetaSlot旨在动态适应对象数量，提升表示效果。

Method: MetaSlot通过维护对象原型代码本、去重槽表示及注入渐进噪声，改进了Slot Attention的迭代过程。

Result: 在多个公共数据集和任务中，MetaSlot显著提升了性能和槽表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: MetaSlot是一种通用的Slot Attention改进方法，可无缝集成到现有OCL架构中，提升对象表示效果。

Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key
to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation
Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL)
methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects'
super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However,
their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as
multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a
plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts.
MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset
by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate
slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the
codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention
iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general
Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL
architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object
discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant
performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared
with existing Slot Attention variants.

Motivation: 传统逆问题方法依赖手工先验，难以捕捉复杂数据；扩散模型虽表现优异，但存在计算负担重和收敛不优的问题。

Method: 提出DMILO（中间层优化）减轻内存负担，并引入稀疏偏差扩展模型范围；进一步提出DMILO-PGD（结合投影梯度下降）优化收敛。

Result: 在多种图像数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法，适用于线性和非线性逆问题。

Conclusion: DMILO和DMILO-PGD有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题中的常见挑战，提升了重建性能。

Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy
observations. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which
can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of
pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved
reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion
models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable
reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based
methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and
suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work
DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and
DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs
intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent
in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range
of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the
range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates
ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of
suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our
approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through
extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and
nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD
in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

Motivation: 传统欧几里得空间无法有效捕捉特征的层次关系，导致异常检测性能不佳。

Result: 双曲空间方法在图像和像素级别均优于欧几里得方法，且对参数变化具有鲁棒性，适用于少样本场景。

Conclusion: 双曲空间是医学异常检测的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection has emerged as a promising solution to challenges
in data availability and labeling constraints. Traditional methods extract
features from different layers of pre-trained networks in Euclidean space;
however, Euclidean representations fail to effectively capture the hierarchical
relationships within these features, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection
performance. We propose a novel yet simple approach that projects feature
representations into hyperbolic space, aggregates them based on confidence
levels, and classifies samples as healthy or anomalous. Our experiments
demonstrate that hyperbolic space consistently outperforms Euclidean-based
frameworks, achieving higher AUROC scores at both image and pixel levels across
multiple medical benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that hyperbolic
space exhibits resilience to parameter variations and excels in few-shot
scenarios, where healthy images are scarce. These findings underscore the
potential of hyperbolic space as a powerful alternative for medical anomaly
detection. The project website can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实应用中数据分布可能发生变化（领域偏移），传统SSFL假设训练和测试数据分布相同，导致泛化能力不足。本文旨在提升SSFL在领域偏移情况下的实用性。

Method: 提出UAP框架，包含两阶段训练：1）服务器模型学习并对齐特征分布；2）客户端利用服务器特征分布调整自身特征。

Result: 在多个标准领域泛化数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，UAP在SSFL设置中实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UAP通过创新的两阶段训练方法，有效解决了SSFL中的领域泛化问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) is gaining popularity over
conventional Federated Learning in many real-world applications. Due to the
practical limitation of limited labeled data on the client side, SSFL considers
that participating clients train with unlabeled data, and only the central
server has the necessary resources to access limited labeled data, making it an
ideal fit for real-world applications (e.g., healthcare). However, traditional
SSFL assumes that the data distributions in the training phase and testing
phase are the same. In practice, however, domain shifts frequently occur,
making it essential for SSFL to incorporate generalization capabilities and
enhance their practicality. The core challenge is improving model
generalization to new, unseen domains while the client participate in SSFL.
However, the decentralized setup of SSFL and unsupervised client training
necessitates innovation to achieve improved generalization across domains. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Unified Alignment
Protocol (UAP), which consists of an alternating two-stage training process.
The first stage involves training the server model to learn and align the
features with a parametric distribution, which is subsequently communicated to
clients without additional communication overhead. The second stage proposes a
novel training algorithm that utilizes the server feature distribution to align
client features accordingly. Our extensive experiments on standard domain
generalization benchmark datasets across multiple model architectures reveal
that proposed UAP successfully achieves SOTA generalization performance in SSFL
setting.

Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型在农作物测绘中表现不佳，主要因为固定时空窗口或忽略时间信息，无法捕捉多尺度时空模式。

Method: 提出AgriFM，基于改进的Video Swin Transformer架构，同步时空下采样，结合多源卫星数据（MODIS、Landsat-8/9、Sentinel-2）进行预训练。

Result: AgriFM在各项下游任务中优于传统深度学习和现有通用遥感基础模型。

Conclusion: AgriFM通过统一处理时空特征和多源数据，为农作物测绘提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale
spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field
textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both
short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics.
Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising
potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified
spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop
mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the
multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information
by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present
AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed
for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the
necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction,
leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture
where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations.
This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series
satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three
satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is
pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image
samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates
a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned
spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over
conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose
RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD和Eyecandies数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Mentor3AD通过多模态导师学习显著提升了3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal feature reconstruction is a promising approach for 3D anomaly
detection, leveraging the complementary information from dual modalities. We
further advance this paradigm by utilizing multi-modal mentor learning, which
fuses intermediate features to further distinguish normal from feature
differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called
Mentor3AD, which utilizes multi-modal mentor learning. By leveraging the shared
features of different modalities, Mentor3AD can extract more effective features
and guide feature reconstruction, ultimately improving detection performance.
Specifically, Mentor3AD includes a Mentor of Fusion Module (MFM) that merges
features extracted from RGB and 3D modalities to create a mentor feature.
Additionally, we have designed a Mentor of Guidance Module (MGM) to facilitate
cross-modal reconstruction, supported by the mentor feature. Lastly, we
introduce a Voting Module (VM) to more accurately generate the final anomaly
score. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies
have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: ACTIVE-O3为MLLMs的主动感知研究提供了简单代码库和评估协议，推动了该领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成更多样化的流程，并显著提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在减少计算成本的同时，提高了生成流程的多样性和图像质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to
complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators,
adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant
improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires
substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this
process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical
limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with
hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized
training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework
that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of
reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from
prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation
during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial
workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides
the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally,
we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that
extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further
improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of
comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater
diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: 噪声对齐策略有效避免了外部布局冲突，同时保持了模型原始分布的多样性。

Abstract: Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing
text-to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage,
causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing
leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial
location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout
control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the
innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment
with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts
a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and
refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced
layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve
the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and
refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear
boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results
show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment
and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided
techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original
distribution.

Result: InstGenIE在图像编辑任务中实现了高达3倍的吞吐量提升和14.7倍的延迟降低，同时确保图像质量。

Conclusion: InstGenIE通过创新优化策略，显著提升了扩散模型在图像编辑任务中的服务效率。

Abstract: Generative image editing using diffusion models has become a prevalent
application in today's AI cloud services. In production environments, image
editing typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image
template to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the
editing process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper,
we present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests.
The key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked
regions of image templates while preserving the original content in the
unmasked areas. Driven by this insight, InstGenIE judiciously skips redundant
computations associated with the unmasked areas by reusing cached intermediate
activations from previous inferences. To mitigate the high cache loading
overhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps
computation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in
online serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel
continuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly
arrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising
computation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous
masks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing
strategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache
loading. Collectively, InstGenIE outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion serving
systems for image editing, achieving up to 3x higher throughput and reducing
average request latency by up to 14.7x while ensuring image quality.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of fault prediction and delayed response
in distributed systems by proposing an intelligent prediction method based on
temporal feature learning. The method takes multi-dimensional performance
metric sequences as input. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the
evolution of system states over time. An attention mechanism is then applied to
enhance key temporal segments, improving the model's ability to identify
potential faults. On this basis, a feedforward neural network is designed to
perform the final classification, enabling early warning of system failures. To
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparative experiments
and ablation analyses were conducted using data from a large-scale real-world
cloud system. The experimental results show that the model outperforms various
mainstream time-series models in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. This
demonstrates strong prediction capability and stability. Furthermore, the loss
function curve confirms the convergence and reliability of the training
process. It indicates that the proposed method effectively learns system
behavior patterns and achieves efficient fault detection.

Conclusion: CRLSM在生物系统动力学建模中更具优势，但PINN的未来优化可能提升其性能。

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of dynamics in biological systems allows for better
observation and characterization of processes, such as calcium signaling in
cell culture. Recent advancements in techniques allow the exploration of
previously unattainable insights of dynamical systems, such as the Sparse
Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy), overcoming the limitations of
more classic methodologies. The latter requires some prior knowledge of an
effective library of candidate terms, which is not realistic for a real case
study. Using inspiration from fields like traffic density estimation and
control theory, we propose a methodology for characterization and performance
analysis of calcium delivery in a family of cells. In this work, we compare the
performance of the Constrained Regularized Least-Squares Method (CRLSM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for system identification and parameter
discovery for governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The CRLSM
achieves a fairly good parameter estimate and a good data fit when using the
learned parameters in the Consensus problem. On the other hand, despite the
initial hypothesis, PINNs fail to match the CRLSM performance and, under the
current configuration, do not provide fair parameter estimation. However, we
have only studied a limited number of PINN architectures, and it is expected
that additional hyperparameter tuning, as well as uncertainty quantification,
could significantly improve the performance in future works.

Abstract: A pivotal area of research in antibody engineering is to find effective
modifications that enhance antibody-antigen binding affinity. Traditional
wet-lab experiments assess mutants in a costly and time-consuming manner.
Emerging deep learning solutions offer an alternative by modeling antibody
structures to predict binding affinity changes. However, they heavily depend on
high-quality complex structures, which are frequently unavailable in practice.
Therefore, we propose ProtAttBA, a deep learning model that predicts binding
affinity changes based solely on the sequence information of antibody-antigen
complexes. ProtAttBA employs a pre-training phase to learn protein sequence
patterns, following a supervised training phase using labeled antibody-antigen
complex data to train a cross-attention-based regressor for predicting binding
affinity changes. We evaluated ProtAttBA on three open benchmarks under
different conditions. Compared to both sequence- and structure-based prediction
methods, our approach achieves competitive performance, demonstrating notable
robustness, especially with uncertain complex structures. Notably, our method
possesses interpretability from the attention mechanism. We show that the
learned attention scores can identify critical residues with impacts on binding
affinity. This work introduces a rapid and cost-effective computational tool
for antibody engineering, with the potential to accelerate the development of
novel therapeutic antibodies.

### [387] [Towards Emotionally Consistent Text-Based Speech Editing: Introducing EmoCorrector and The ECD-TSE Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20341)
*Rui Liu,Pu Gao,Jiatian Xi,Berrak Sisman,Carlos Busso,Haizhou Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EmoCorrector是一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的文本语音编辑（TSE）后校正方案，旨在解决现有TSE方法中情感不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSE方法主要关注内容准确性和声学一致性，但忽视了文本修改导致的情感变化或不一致问题。

Method: EmoCorrector通过提取编辑文本的情感特征，检索匹配情感的语音样本，并合成符合目标情感的语音，同时保留说话者身份和音质。

Result: 实验证明EmoCorrector显著提升了目标情感的表达，并解决了当前TSE方法中的情感不一致问题。

Conclusion: EmoCorrector为TSE领域的情感一致性建模提供了有效解决方案，并通过ECD-TSE数据集支持了相关研究和评估。

Abstract: Text-based speech editing (TSE) modifies speech using only text, eliminating
re-recording. However, existing TSE methods, mainly focus on the content
accuracy and acoustic consistency of synthetic speech segments, and often
overlook the emotional shifts or inconsistency issues introduced by text
changes. To address this issue, we propose EmoCorrector, a novel
post-correction scheme for TSE. EmoCorrector leverages Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) by extracting the edited text's emotional features, retrieving
speech samples with matching emotions, and synthesizing speech that aligns with
the desired emotion while preserving the speaker's identity and quality. To
support the training and evaluation of emotional consistency modeling in TSE,
we pioneer the benchmarking Emotion Correction Dataset for TSE (ECD-TSE). The
prominent aspect of ECD-TSE is its inclusion of $<$text, speech$>$ paired data
featuring diverse text variations and a range of emotional expressions.
Subjective and objective experiments and comprehensive analysis on ECD-TSE
confirm that EmoCorrector significantly enhances the expression of intended
emotion while addressing emotion inconsistency limitations in current TSE
methods. Code and audio examples are available at

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种即插即用的跨说话人注意力模块，用于处理视频中多个共现人脸，提升复杂多人环境下的说话人提取准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，视频常包含多个共现人脸，传统方法仅利用目标说话人的面部信息，忽略了其他共现人脸的潜在有用信息。

Method: 引入跨说话人注意力模块，可灵活处理任意数量的共现人脸，并将其集成到AV-DPRNN和AV-TFGridNet模型中。

Result: 在VoxCeleb2和MISP等多样数据集上，该方法显著优于基线模型，且在LRS2和LRS3上的跨数据集评估验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 跨说话人注意力模块有效提升了复杂多人环境下的说话人提取性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Audio-visual speaker extraction isolates a target speaker's speech from a
mixture speech signal conditioned on a visual cue, typically using the target
speaker's face recording. However, in real-world scenarios, other co-occurring
faces are often present on-screen, providing valuable speaker activity cues in
the scene. In this work, we introduce a plug-and-play inter-speaker attention
module to process these flexible numbers of co-occurring faces, allowing for
more accurate speaker extraction in complex multi-person environments. We
integrate our module into two prominent models: the AV-DPRNN and the
state-of-the-art AV-TFGridNet. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets,
including the highly overlapped VoxCeleb2 and sparsely overlapped MISP,
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore,
cross-dataset evaluations on LRS2 and LRS3 confirm the robustness and
generalizability of our method.

Motivation: 解决波斯语等低资源语言ASR系统评估的挑战，提供更全面的基准和评估方法。

Method: 构建PSRB基准，评估十种ASR系统，分析转录错误并提出新的加权替换错误度量。

Result: ASR模型在标准波斯语上表现良好，但在区域口音、儿童语音和特定语言挑战上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PSRB为波斯语ASR研究提供了资源，并可作为其他低资源语言基准开发的框架。

Abstract: Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become an integral
part of modern technology, their evaluation remains challenging, particularly
for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper introduces Persian
Speech Recognition Benchmark(PSRB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to
address this gap by incorporating diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions.
We evaluate ten ASR systems, including state-of-the-art commercial and
open-source models, to examine performance variations and inherent biases.
Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Persian ASR transcriptions,
identifying key error types and proposing a novel metric that weights
substitution errors. This metric enhances evaluation robustness by reducing the
impact of minor and partial errors, thereby improving the precision of
performance assessment. Our findings indicate that while ASR models generally
perform well on standard Persian, they struggle with regional accents,
children's speech, and specific linguistic challenges. These results highlight
the necessity of fine-tuning and incorporating diverse, representative training
datasets to mitigate biases and enhance overall ASR performance. PSRB provides
a valuable resource for advancing ASR research in Persian and serves as a
framework for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages. A subset
of the PSRB dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: MedSentry是一个用于评估多代理LLM系统安全性的基准，包含5000个对抗性医疗提示，并开发了攻击-防御评估管道。研究发现不同拓扑结构对攻击的抵抗力差异显著，提出了检测和修复恶意代理的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗领域的广泛应用，确保其安全性，尤其是在多代理协作配置中，至关重要。

Method: 引入MedSentry基准和攻击-防御评估管道，分析四种多代理拓扑结构（Layers、SharedPool、Centralized、Decentralized）的抗攻击能力。

Result: SharedPool因开放信息共享易受攻击，而Decentralized因冗余和隔离表现出更强的韧性。提出的检测和修复机制能恢复系统安全性。

Conclusion: MedSentry为医疗领域多代理LLM系统的安全设计提供了评估框架和防御策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare,
ensuring their safety, particularly within collaborative multi-agent
configurations, is paramount. In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark
comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with
100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end
attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four
representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and
Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings
reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information
contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying
vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing
makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit
greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate
these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism
that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to
near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation
framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer
LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的多智能体世界模型（DIMA），通过序列化建模降低复杂性，显著提升了多智能体强化学习中的样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中，联合动作空间大且动态高度不确定，传统方法建模复杂且不准确。

Method: 采用序列化智能体建模，利用扩散模型的反向过程逐步揭示智能体动作，构建更准确的世界模型。

Result: DIMA在多个多智能体控制基准测试中表现最优，显著优于现有世界模型。

Conclusion: DIMA为多智能体世界模型构建提供了新范式，推动了多智能体强化学习的研究前沿。

Abstract: World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency
for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is
challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly
uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce
modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action
transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep
through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model
to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured
dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how
agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of
agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in
diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their
expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent
variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust
world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired
Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior
world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo
and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent
world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高保真社交模拟平台，通过模拟用户认知代理和动态社交互动，解决传统推荐系统依赖静态数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统基于静态离线数据，无法捕捉用户长期偏好演变和社交影响动态，因此需要更真实的模拟环境。

Method: 平台包含Sim-User代理，采用五层认知架构（如ICR2动机引擎）和多层异质社交图（GGBond Graph），模拟用户行为和社交动态。

Result: 系统能自主响应推荐算法（如矩阵分解、LightGCN），动态更新用户状态和社交关系，形成稳定反馈循环。

Conclusion: 该设计超越传统静态数据集限制，为评估长期推荐效果提供了可控、可观测的环境。

Abstract: Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline
data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability
to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in
real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive
agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior
evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system
comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer
cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms,
including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference
learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively
introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine
grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic
user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer
heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational
evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics
based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily.
During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations
generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization,
MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while
dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby
forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends
the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled,
observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.

Method: 通过分析四个关键领域（社会性、环境设计、协调协议和涌现行为测量），对比MAS理论与MAS LLMs实践的差异。

Result: 发现许多MAS LLMs缺乏多智能体特性（如自主性、社会交互），依赖过于简化的LLM中心架构。

Conclusion: 建议整合MAS理论概念，采用更精确的术语，以避免误解和错失研究机会。

Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs)
has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex
tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS
without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we
highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs
implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency,
environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring
emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent
characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured
environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The
field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature
has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and
outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating
established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid
mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

Motivation: 现有方法仅支持单频射频辐射场建模，无法处理宽带频率范围。本文旨在通过频率嵌入的3D高斯溅射算法，实现对任意未知频率的射频辐射场建模。

Method: 设计了电磁特征网络（包含衰减和辐射模块），学习射频频率与3D高斯属性（衰减因子和信号强度）的关系。通过训练频率嵌入的3D高斯溅射模型，实现宽带频率范围内的辐射场重建。

Result: 在实验中，方法在未知频率下的平均SSIM达到0.72，比现有技术提升17.8%。即使未在特定频率上训练，SSIM仍保持0.70，性能仅下降2.8%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够高效重建宽带频率范围内的射频辐射场，性能显著优于现有技术，且具备对未知频率的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative frequency-embedded 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS) algorithm for wideband radio-frequency (RF) radiance field modeling,
offering an advancement over the existing works limited to single-frequency
modeling. Grounded in fundamental physics, we uncover the complex relationship
between EM wave propagation behaviors and RF frequencies. Inspired by this, we
design an EM feature network with attenuation and radiance modules to learn the
complex relationships between RF frequencies and the key properties of each 3D
Gaussian, specifically the attenuation factor and RF signal intensity. By
training the frequency-embedded 3DGS model, we can efficiently reconstruct RF
radiance fields at arbitrary unknown frequencies within a given 3D environment.
Finally, we propose a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset
containing 50000 samples ranging from 1 to 100 GHz in 6 indoor environments,
and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method.
Our approach achieves an average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) up
to 0.72, and a significant improvement up to 17.8% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on individual test frequencies.
Additionally, our method achieves an SSIM of 0.70 without prior training on
these frequencies, which represents only a 2.8% performance drop compared to
models trained with full PAS data. This demonstrates our model's capability to
estimate PAS at unknown frequencies. For related code and datasets, please

Conclusion: 建议在设计量子数据重上传模型时，采用更宽的电路架构而非更深的窄架构。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models incorporating data re-uploading circuits have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional expressivity and
trainability. However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen
data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently
investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive
performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading
model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing
high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their
predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels
as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data
uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are
validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and
real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that when processing
high-dimensional data, the quantum data re-uploading models should be designed
with wider circuit architectures rather than deeper and narrower ones.

Conclusion: 量子上下文性对QAIXI模型有根本性影响，为量子环境下的通用智能研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based
upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is
fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is
modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the
exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems
classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical
analogues of AIXI which are theoretically consistent or practically feasible as
models of universal intelligence. To address this question, we extend the
framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce
a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and
classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both
classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in
quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov
complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations
upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally
affects QAIXI models.

machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong
generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting

Motivation: EHR数据具有稀疏性、异质性和高维度，且缺乏标准化标签，导致建模困难。SCORE旨在解决这些问题，提升个性化医疗的预测能力。

Method: SCORE采用PALM模型和预训练代码嵌入，结合混合EM和GVA算法处理大规模数据，利用少量标签数据优化未标记样本的估计。

Result: 理论分析证明SCORE的收敛性，实验显示其性能优于现有方法，尤其在标签稀缺时表现更优。应用于多发性硬化症（MS）患者数据时，SCORE生成更具预测性的嵌入。

Conclusion: SCORE通过半监督学习和混合算法显著提升了EHR数据的建模能力，为个性化医疗提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) offer rich real-world data for personalized
medicine, providing insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and
patient outcomes. However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high
dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized
ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these
challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning
framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient
embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model
with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract
meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational
challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization
(EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited
labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We
theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA
errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our
analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces
sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior
finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to
predict disability status for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using
partially labeled EHR data, demonstrating that it produces more informative and
predictive patient embeddings for multiple MS-related conditions compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的统一框架，用于从Gaia G波段光变曲线估计RR Lyrae星的金属丰度，适用于两种脉动类型（RRab和RRc），并展示了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ESA Gaia DR3提供了约27万颗RR Lyrae星的光变曲线，亟需可扩展的方法从光度数据估计其金属丰度。

Method: 采用基于门控循环单元（GRU）的神经网络，结合预处理步骤（如相位折叠、平滑和样本加权），利用文献中的光度金属丰度作为训练目标。

Result: 模型在验证集上表现优异：RRab星的MAE=0.0565 dex，RMSE=0.0765 dex，R²=0.9401；RRc星的MAE=0.0505 dex，RMSE=0.0720 dex，R²=0.9625。

Conclusion: 深度学习在大规模光度金属丰度估计中表现高效，适用于恒星种群和银河结构研究。

Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity
tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve
morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs,
there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities
from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that
estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone
(RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous
work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy
and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic
regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding,
smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the
literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle
morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring
separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong
performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401;
for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results
show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity
estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and
Galactic structure.

harnesses semantic segmentation to continuously evaluate potential hazards in

method adaptively identifies a stable Safe Landing Zone (SLZ) despite moving
critical obstacles such as vehicles, people, etc., and other visual challenges
like shifting illumination. A control system then guides the UAV toward this
low-risk region, employing altitude-dependent safety thresholds and temporal
landing point stabilization to ensure robust descent trajectories. Experimental
validation in diverse urban environments demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving over 90% landing success rates in very challenging real
scenarios, showing significant improvements in various risk metrics. Our
findings suggest that risk-oriented vision methods can effectively help reduce
the risk of accidents in emergency landing situations, particularly in complex,
unstructured, urban scenarios, densely populated with moving risky obstacles,
while potentiating the true capabilities of UAVs in complex urban operations.

TL;DR: ApBot是一个通过阅读用户手册操作新型家用电器的机器人系统，利用视觉语言模型构建结构化符号模型，并通过视觉反馈更新模型，显著提高了任务成功率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家用电器操作是辅助家庭机器人的关键能力，但直接从非结构化文本中推断策略并执行存在挑战。

Method: ApBot通过视觉语言模型构建电器的结构化符号模型，将符号动作视觉化地映射到控制面板元素，并通过视觉反馈更新模型。

Result: 实验表明，ApBot在模拟和真实环境中均显著提高了任务成功率，优于直接使用大型视觉语言模型作为控制策略的方法。

Conclusion: 结构化内部表示对机器人操作复杂家用电器具有重要作用。

Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is
a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a
robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user
manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial
policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual
document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and
(iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite
compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured,
symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large
vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to
control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model
based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of
simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and
statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with
state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results
suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in
robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models,
Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and
Vision-Language-Action Models have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile
service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of
embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through
physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute
complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in
mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal
sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task
generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we
present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in
mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and
examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role
of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned
control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world
applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation
sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on
service robotics. We also include potential future research directions,
emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term
adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient,
and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器人控制任务中表现良好，但在实际应用中常因忽视物理约束而生成无效动作计划。

Method: 提出RLVR框架，通过奖励机制激励LLMs在生成计划时考虑物理约束，仅对成功完成控制任务的有效计划给予奖励。

Result: 实验表明，约束感知的小型LLMs在BoxNet和BoxNet3D任务中表现优于无约束的大型模型。

Conclusion: 通过物理约束的引入，小型LLMs能够在复杂环境中实现高效、可扩展的多机器人控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various
robot control tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications
remains constrained. Even state-ofthe-art LLMs, such as GPT-o4mini, frequently
produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as
directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between
robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical
constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce
constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only
valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive
rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning
Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results
demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale
models without constraints, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly
developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo. This work highlights the
effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable
scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained
environments.

Abstract: Optical tweezers (OT) offer unparalleled capabilities for micromanipulation
with submicron precision in biomedical applications. However, controlling
conventional multi-trap OT to achieve cooperative manipulation of multiple
complex-shaped microrobots in dynamic environments poses a significant
challenge. To address this, we introduce Interactive OT Gym, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based simulation platform designed for OT-driven microrobotics.
Our platform supports complex physical field simulations and integrates haptic
feedback interfaces, RL modules, and context-aware shared control strategies
tailored for OT-driven microrobot in cooperative biological object manipulation
tasks. This integration allows for an adaptive blend of manual and autonomous
control, enabling seamless transitions between human input and autonomous
operation. We evaluated the effectiveness of our platform using a cell
manipulation task. Experimental results show that our shared control system
significantly improves micromanipulation performance, reducing task completion
time by approximately 67% compared to using pure human or RL control alone and
achieving a 100% success rate. With its high fidelity, interactivity, low cost,
and high-speed simulation capabilities, Interactive OT Gym serves as a
user-friendly training and testing environment for the development of advanced
interactive OT-driven micromanipulation systems and control algorithms. For

Abstract: Path planning is a critical component in autonomous drone operations,
enabling safe and efficient navigation through complex environments. Recent
advances in foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhanced
perception and intelligent decision-making in robotics. However, their
practical applicability and effectiveness in global path planning remain
relatively unexplored. This paper proposes foundation model-guided path
planners (FM-Planner) and presents a comprehensive benchmarking study and
practical validation for drone path planning. Specifically, we first
systematically evaluate eight representative LLM and VLM approaches using
standardized simulation scenarios. To enable effective real-time navigation, we
then design an integrated LLM-Vision planner that combines semantic reasoning
with visual perception. Furthermore, we deploy and validate the proposed path
planner through real-world experiments under multiple configurations. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the strengths, limitations, and
feasibility of deploying foundation models in real-world drone applications and
providing practical implementations in autonomous flight. Project site:

TL;DR: STITCH-OPE是一种基于生成模型的离线策略评估方法，通过去噪扩散技术解决高维长时域问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人或医疗等领域，直接与环境交互成本高或不安全，现有离线策略评估方法在高维长时域问题中效果不佳。

Method: 利用预训练的去噪扩散模型，通过目标策略的得分函数引导生成合成轨迹，并引入两项技术创新：减去行为策略得分以防止过正则化，以及端到端拼接部分轨迹生成长时域轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL和OpenAI Gym基准测试中，STITCH-OPE在均方误差、相关性和遗憾指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STITCH-OPE通过去噪扩散和轨迹拼接技术，有效解决了高维长时域离线策略评估问题，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the performance of a target policy
using offline data collected from a behavior policy, and is crucial in domains
such as robotics or healthcare where direct interaction with the environment is
costly or unsafe. Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional,
long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance
weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these
challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that
leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state
and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior
data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by
guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy.
STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for
OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior
policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by
stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical
guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an
exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion.
Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement
in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to
state-of-the-art OPE methods.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索慢思维（slow thinking）在机器人基础模型中的潜力，以提升复杂任务的处理能力。

Method: Hume采用双系统架构：System-2通过价值查询头估计动作状态值，重复采样并选择最优动作；System-1则是一个轻量级反应策略，负责级联动作去噪。

Result: Hume在多个仿真基准和实际机器人部署中表现优于现有最先进的VLA模型。

Conclusion: Hume通过结合慢思维和实时动作预测，显著提升了机器人控制的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling
complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has
achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to
solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking
remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the
physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and
cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of
Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume
implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model
backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of
predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling
multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value.
System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System
2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot
control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low
frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action
candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across
multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.

Motivation: 梯度剪裁在机器学习和深度学习中广泛应用，但其在重尾噪声和$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性假设下的高概率收敛性尚未完全解决。

Method: 通过分析Clip-SGD在凸$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑优化问题中的应用，建立了高概率收敛界。

Result: 研究恢复了确定性情况和$L_1=0$时的已知边界，避免了指数级大因子和不依赖严格的次高斯噪声假设。

Conclusion: 本文显著扩展了梯度剪裁的适用范围，为其在更广泛场景中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a widely used technique in Machine Learning and Deep
Learning (DL), known for its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of
heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in the training of large language
models. Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD,
exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the
$(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks.
However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions --
heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed
in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing
the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends
prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the
stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid
exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise
assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping.

Motivation: 在能源转型背景下，家庭能源管理对缓解电网压力至关重要，但如何优化家庭EV充电尚不明确。

Method: 研究分析了90户家庭的真实数据，比较了DRL、规则控制和模型预测控制在HEM中的应用。

Result: DRL能有效将EV和电池充电与光伏剩余对齐；高电池容量时自优化足够，低电池容量时DRL效果显著。

Conclusion: DRL对有优化潜力的家庭有益，有助于电力系统脱碳。

Abstract: Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid
stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable
energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize
prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on
fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the
potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches
(Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain
environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging
patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage
with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions,
early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed
analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high
battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further
algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery
capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost
savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our
simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with
optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full
electricity system and its decarbonization.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够准确重建和分离保守与受迫动力学，提供可解释且物理一致的预测。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏速度数据的情况下仍能有效学习系统动力学，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven method for learning the equations of motion of
mechanical systems directly from position measurements, without requiring
access to velocity data. This is particularly relevant in system identification
tasks where only positional information is available, such as motion capture,
pixel data or low-resolution tracking. Our approach takes advantage of the
discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and the forced discrete Euler-Lagrange
equations to construct a physically grounded model of the system's dynamics. We
decompose the dynamics into conservative and non-conservative components, which
are learned separately using feed-forward neural networks. In the absence of
external forces, our method reduces to a variational discretization of the
action principle naturally preserving the symplectic structure of the
underlying Hamiltonian system. We validate our approach on a variety of
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to
baseline methods. In particular, we apply our model to (1) measured human
motion data and (2) latent embeddings obtained via an autoencoder trained on
image sequences. We demonstrate that we can faithfully reconstruct and separate
both the conservative and forced dynamics, yielding interpretable and
physically consistent predictions.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, process systems
engineering must adapt to digital transformation. While reinforcement learning
offers a model-free approach to process control, its applications are limited
by the dependence on accurate digital twins and well-designed reward functions.
To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that
integrates inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with multi-task learning for
data-driven, multi-mode control design. Using historical closed-loop data as
expert demonstrations, IRL extracts optimal reward functions and control
policies. A latent-context variable is incorporated to distinguish modes,
enabling the training of mode-specific controllers. Case studies on a
continuous stirred tank reactor and a fed-batch bioreactor validate the
effectiveness of this framework in handling multi-mode data and training
adaptable controllers.

Abstract: Metamaterials, engineered materials with architected structures across
multiple length scales, offer unprecedented and tunable mechanical properties
that surpass those of conventional materials. However, leveraging advanced
machine learning (ML) for metamaterial discovery is hindered by three
fundamental challenges: (C1) Data Heterogeneity Challenge arises from
heterogeneous data sources, heterogeneous composition scales, and heterogeneous
structure categories; (C2) Model Complexity Challenge stems from the intricate
geometric constraints of ML models, which complicate their adaptation to
metamaterial structures; and (C3) Human-AI Collaboration Challenge comes from
the "dual black-box'' nature of sophisticated ML models and the need for
intuitive user interfaces. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a unified
framework, named MetamatBench, that operates on three levels. (1) At the data
level, we integrate and standardize 5 heterogeneous, multi-modal metamaterial
datasets. (2) The ML level provides a comprehensive toolkit that adapts 17
state-of-the-art ML methods for metamaterial discovery. It also includes a
comprehensive evaluation suite with 12 novel performance metrics with finite
element-based assessments to ensure accurate and reliable model validation. (3)
The user level features a visual-interactive interface that bridges the gap
between complex ML techniques and non-ML researchers, advancing property
prediction and inverse design of metamaterials for research and applications.
MetamatBench offers a unified platform deployed at
http://zhoulab-1.cs.vt.edu:5550 that enables machine learning researchers and
practitioners to develop and evaluate new methodologies in metamaterial
discovery. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark
and the codebase at https://github.com/cjpcool/Metamaterial-Benchmark.

Abstract: During job recruitment, traditional applicant selection methods often lack

recruiting decisions, whether they are made manually by human recruiters or
through the use of black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address this
problem, our work introduces a multi-agent AI system that uses Large Language

iterative user-centric design approach, we first conducted a two-phased
exploratory study with four active job seekers to inform the design and
development of the system. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative
user study with 20 active job seekers through individual one-to-one interviews
to evaluate the developed prototype. The results of our evaluation demonstrate
that participants perceived our multi-agent recruitment system as significantly
more actionable, trustworthy, and fair compared to traditional methods. Our
study further helped us uncover in-depth insights into factors contributing to
these perceived user experiences. Drawing from these insights, we offer broader
design implications for building user-aligned, multi-agent explainable AI

differences and biases related to race, gender, and physical traits across

racial groups (East Asian, White, Middle Eastern, Latino, South Asian, and
Black) and different countries; (2) Personal Traits to Country retrieval, where
images are paired with trait-based prompts (e.g., Smart, Honest, Criminal,

*Anna Neumann,Elisabeth Kirsten,Muhammad Bilal Zafar,Jatinder Singh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中系统提示对模型行为的影响，揭示了因信息位置不同导致的偏见和潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统提示的复杂性和不透明性可能导致偏见和不可控的副作用，研究旨在揭示这一问题。

Method: 比较了六种商业LLM中系统提示与用户提示对50个人口统计群体处理方式的差异。

Result: 发现显著的偏见，表现为用户代表性和决策场景中的差异，这些偏见源于不透明的系统配置。

Conclusion: 建议将系统提示分析纳入AI审计流程，以减少潜在危害。

Abstract: System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that
guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing
and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent
responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system
prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts
without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation
remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex,
they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This
lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of
information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work
examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end,
we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user
prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our
analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user
representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from
inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk
representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms
beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to
these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left
unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated
into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become
increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

*Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: PyRML是一个轻量级的Python库，用于通过声明式映射构建知识图谱，支持RML核心功能，并集成常用数据工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱（KGs）在多个领域中被广泛采用，但现有工具在灵活性和易用性上存在不足。PyRML旨在降低KG构建门槛，提升可复用性和可操作性。

Method: PyRML是一个Python原生库，支持RML核心功能，提供编程接口用于创建、执行和测试映射，并与Pandas和RDFlib等工具集成。

Result: PyRML实现了透明、模块化的工作流，简化了知识图谱的构建过程，并支持与现有语义Web工具的无缝集成。

Conclusion: PyRML填补了声明式语义与实际KG工程之间的空白，为可复现的、本体对齐的数据集成提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are increasingly adopted as a foundational technology
for integrating heterogeneous data in domains such as climate science, cultural
heritage, and the life sciences. Declarative mapping languages like R2RML and
RML have played a central role in enabling scalable and reusable KG
construction, offering a transparent means of transforming structured and
semi-structured data into RDF. In this paper, we present PyRML, a lightweight,
Python-native library for building Knowledge Graphs through declarative
mappings. PyRML supports core RML constructs and provides a programmable
interface for authoring, executing, and testing mappings directly within Python
environments. It integrates with popular data and semantic web libraries (e.g.,
Pandas and RDFlib), enabling transparent and modular workflows. By lowering the
barrier to entry for KG creation and fostering reproducible, ontology-aligned
data integration, PyRML bridges the gap between declarative semantics and
practical KG engineering.

*Xiangru Jian,Wei Pang,Zhengyuan Dong,Chao Zhang,M. Tamer Özsu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: LazyVLM是一种神经符号视频分析系统，结合了视觉语言模型的灵活性和高效性，通过分解多帧查询和关系查询执行解决了可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频分析方法在灵活性和效率之间存在权衡，视觉语言模型（VLMs）处理长上下文时效率低，而神经符号方法依赖手动标记和固定规则。

Method: LazyVLM通过半结构化文本接口支持复杂多帧查询，并将查询分解为细粒度操作，利用关系查询执行和向量相似性搜索提高效率。

Result: LazyVLM提供了一个高效、用户友好的解决方案，适用于大规模开放域视频数据查询。

Conclusion: LazyVLM在灵活性和效率之间取得了平衡，为视频分析提供了一种可扩展且易用的方法。

Abstract: Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between
flexibility and efficiency. End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often
struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while
neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule
design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics
system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while
addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly
drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a
semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability
limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into
fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient
relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that
LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying
open-domain video data at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图解释复杂且AI模型缺乏透明度，限制了临床实用性。受Transformer在NLP中处理序列数据的启发，将ECG视为心脏的‘语言’。

Method: 提出CardioPatternFormer模型，利用注意力机制精确识别和分类心脏模式，突出关键信号区域。

Result: 模型在复杂心电图（包括多病理情况）中表现优异，通过注意力图提供透明解释。

Conclusion: 该模型为心电图分析提供了透明可靠的解决方案，推动AI在心脏病学中的临床应用。

Abstract: Accurate ECG interpretation is vital, yet complex cardiac data and
"black-box" AI models limit clinical utility. Inspired by Transformer
architectures' success in NLP for understanding sequential data, we frame ECG
as the heart's unique "language" of temporal patterns. We present
CardioPatternFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for interpretable ECG
classification. It employs a sophisticated attention mechanism to precisely
identify and classify diverse cardiac patterns, excelling at discerning subtle
anomalies and distinguishing multiple co-occurring conditions. This
pattern-guided attention provides clear insights by highlighting influential
signal regions, effectively allowing the "heart to talk" through transparent
interpretations. CardioPatternFormer demonstrates robust performance on
challenging ECGs, including complex multi-pathology cases. Its interpretability
via attention maps enables clinicians to understand the model's rationale,
fostering trust and aiding informed diagnostic decisions. This work offers a
powerful, transparent solution for advanced ECG analysis, paving the way for
more reliable and clinically actionable AI in cardiology.

TL;DR: BrainStratify是一种从颅内神经信号解码语音的统一框架，通过粗到细的神经解耦方法显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决颅内神经信号中任务相关信号稀疏分布且与无关信号纠缠的问题。

Method: 结合空间上下文引导的时空建模识别功能组，并使用解耦乘积量化（DPQ）解耦目标功能组内的神经动态。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上显著优于现有解码方法。

Conclusion: BrainStratify为颅内记录语音解码提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in
brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances
have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential
recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and
ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level
activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are
sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled
with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these
challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement
framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups
through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii)
disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using
Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two
open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like
vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that
BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial
neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall,
by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity,
BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding
from intracranial recordings.

*Rafael Valente da Silva,Onel L. Alcaraz López,Richard Demo Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FLDA的方法，通过在联邦学习（FL）和联邦蒸馏（FD）之间交替使用，解决了物联网（IoT）网络中设备能源和通信资源受限的问题。FLDA在降低通信开销和能耗的同时，提高了模型精度和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络中设备能源和通信资源有限，尤其是依赖能量收集（EH）的设备，能源可用性波动大，影响联邦学习的参与度。此外，大模型更新在共享无线环境中易受干扰。联邦蒸馏（FD）虽能降低开销，但会牺牲模型精度。因此，需要一种平衡的方法。

Method: 提出FLDA方法，设备在FL和FD阶段之间交替运行，结合两者的优势。实验基于多通道时隙ALOHA EH-IoT网络，考虑了背景流量和干扰。

Result: FLDA在模型精度上优于FL和FD，收敛速度比FL更快。同时，FLDA能节省高达98%的能耗，且对干扰的敏感性更低。

Conclusion: FLDA是一种有效的解决方案，能够在资源受限的物联网网络中平衡模型性能和能耗，优于单独的FL或FD方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces significant challenges in Internet of Things
(IoT) networks due to device limitations in energy and communication resources,
especially when considering the large size of FL models. From an energy
perspective, the challenge is aggravated if devices rely on energy harvesting
(EH), as energy availability can vary significantly over time, influencing the
average number of participating users in each iteration. Additionally, the
transmission of large model updates is more susceptible to interference from
uncorrelated background traffic in shared wireless environments. As an
alternative, federated distillation (FD) reduces communication overhead and
energy consumption by transmitting local model outputs, which are typically
much smaller than the entire model used in FL. However, this comes at the cost
of reduced model accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FL-distillation
alternation (FLDA). In FLDA, devices alternate between FD and FL phases,
balancing model information with lower communication overhead and energy
consumption per iteration. We consider a multichannel slotted-ALOHA EH-IoT
network subject to background traffic/interference. In such a scenario, FLDA
demonstrates higher model accuracy than both FL and FD, and achieves faster
convergence than FL. Moreover, FLDA achieves target accuracies saving up to 98%
in energy consumption, while also being less sensitive to interference, both
relative to FL.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 通过引入空间随机性训练神经场，显著提升拟合效果，替代或超越传统层次结构和频域构造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场在视觉计算中表现优异，但传统训练方法依赖复杂层次结构或频域构造，限制了效率和通用性。

Method: 提出一种基于高斯分布偏移采样的模糊场查询方法，优化收敛性和鲁棒性，无需额外成本且易于实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种任务（如表面重建和辐射场）中表现优异，与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 随机预条件方法简单高效，为神经场训练提供了通用且强大的优化工具。

Abstract: Neural fields are a highly effective representation across visual computing.
This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by
incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple
technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and
frequency space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly
operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by
sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during
optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of
preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based
perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no
additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic
theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary
conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate
this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids,
triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance
fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been
developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their
performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing
hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经3D表示方法（如NeRF和3DGS）只能估计可见的外部结构，无法识别隐藏在表面后的不可见内部结构。

Method: 提出了SfC-NeRF模型，通过物理约束、外观保持约束和关键帧约束优化视频序列中的不可见内部结构，并引入体积退火技术以避免陷入局部最优。

Result: 在包含115个物体的实验中，SfC-NeRF展示了其有效性，能够处理多种结构和材料特性。

Conclusion: SfC-NeRF成功解决了从碰撞中估计内部结构的任务，为3D表示领域提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance
fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate
estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is
limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the
invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To
overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision
(SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal
structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible
internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical,
appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe
constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima
owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching
for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive
experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity
shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties
of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize how we
design and implement compilers and code translation tools. However, existing
LLMs struggle to handle long and complex programs. We introduce LEGO-Compiler,
a novel neural compilation system that leverages LLMs to translate high-level
languages into assembly code. Our approach centers on three key innovations:
LEGO translation, which decomposes the input program into manageable blocks;
breaking down the complex compilation process into smaller, simpler verifiable
steps by organizing it as a verifiable LLM workflow by external tests; and a
feedback mechanism for self-correction. Supported by formal proofs of
translation composability, LEGO-Compiler demonstrates high accuracy on multiple
datasets, including over 99% on ExeBench and 97.9% on industrial-grade
AnsiBench. Additionally, LEGO-Compiler has also acheived near one
order-of-magnitude improvement on compilable code size scalability. This work
opens new avenues for applying LLMs to system-level tasks, complementing
traditional compiler technologies.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast cancer types plays a critical role in
guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents
an artificial intelligence enabled tool designed to aid in the identification
of breast cancer types using histopathological biopsy images. Traditionally
additional tests have to be done on women who are detected with breast cancer
to find out the types of cancer it is to give the necessary cure. Those tests
are not only invasive but also delay the initiation of treatment and increase
patient burden. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues as well
as accurate subclassification of breast cancer types. By preprocessing the
images to reduce noise and enhance features, the model achieves reliable levels
of classification performance. Experimental results on such datasets
demonstrate the model's effectiveness, outperforming several existing solutions
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study emphasizes the
potential of deep learning techniques in clinical diagnostics and offers a
promising tool to assist pathologists in breast cancer classification.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy leverages nuclear magnetization
to probe molecules' chemical environment, structure, and dynamics, with
applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to the petroleum industry. Despite
its utility, the high cost of NMR instrumentation, operation and the lengthy
duration of experiments necessitate the development of computational techniques
to optimize acquisition times. Non-Uniform sampling (NUS) is widely employed as
a sub-sampling method to address these challenges, but it often introduces
artifacts and degrades spectral quality, offsetting the benefits of reduced
acquisition times. In this work, we propose the use of deep learning techniques
to enhance the reconstruction quality of NUS spectra. Specifically, we explore
the application of diffusion models, a relatively untapped approach in this
domain. Our methodology involves applying diffusion models to both time-time
and time-frequency NUS data, yielding satisfactory reconstructions of
challenging spectra from the benchmark Artina dataset. This approach
demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to improve the efficiency and
accuracy of NMR spectroscopy as well as the superiority of using a
time-frequency domain data over the time-time one, opening new landscapes for
future studies.

Abstract: A cardiac digital twin is a virtual replica of a patient's heart for
screening, diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning of
cardiovascular diseases. This requires an anatomically accurate
patient-specific 3D structural representation of the heart, suitable for

application to a large cohort of ~55000 participants from UK Biobank, and the
construction of the most comprehensive cohort of adult heart models to date,

Conclusion: AI辅助的微超声分析在检测前列腺癌中表现更优，可能减少不必要的活检，并成为低成本筛查替代方案。

Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging
modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial
intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening
methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We
retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with
csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to
extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers
were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice
level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive
slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a
classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and
limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved
AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US
model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical
model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include
a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation.
Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves
specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method
may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to
PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze
prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting
aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.

Abstract: Ratio statistics--such as relative risk and odds ratios--play a central role
in hypothesis testing, model evaluation, and decision-making across many areas
of machine learning, including causal inference and fairness analysis. However,
despite privacy concerns surrounding many datasets and despite increasing
adoption of differential privacy, differentially private ratio statistics have
largely been neglected by the literature and have only recently received an
initial treatment by Lin et al. [1]. This paper attempts to fill this lacuna,
giving results that can guide practice in evaluating ratios when the results
must be protected by differential privacy. In particular, we show that even a
simple algorithm can provide excellent properties concerning privacy, sample
accuracy, and bias, not just asymptotically but also at quite small sample
sizes. Additionally, we analyze a differentially private estimator for relative
risk, prove its consistency, and develop a method for constructing valid
confidence intervals. Our approach bridges a gap in the differential privacy
literature and provides a practical solution for ratio estimation in private
machine learning pipelines.

### [430] [Kernel Quantile Embeddings and Associated Probability Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20433)
*Masha Naslidnyk,Siu Lun Chau,François-Xavier Briol,Krikamol Muandet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的核分位数嵌入（KQE）方法，用于表示概率分布，并构建了一系列距离度量，这些度量在较弱条件下是概率度量，且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨均值函数是否是RKHS中唯一有意义的表示方式，并寻找更灵活的分布表示方法。

Method: 方法是通过引入核分位数嵌入（KQE），构建新的距离度量，并验证其在假设检验中的表现。

Result: 结果表明，KQE构建的距离在较弱条件下是概率度量，计算效率高，且在假设检验中表现优于MMD及其快速近似。

Conclusion: 结论是KQE提供了一种有竞争力的替代方案，扩展了RKHS中分布表示的可能性。

Abstract: Embedding probability distributions into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHS) has enabled powerful nonparametric methods such as the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD), a statistical distance with strong theoretical and
computational properties. At its core, the MMD relies on kernel mean embeddings
to represent distributions as mean functions in RKHS. However, it remains
unclear if the mean function is the only meaningful RKHS representation.
Inspired by generalised quantiles, we introduce the notion of kernel quantile
embeddings (KQEs). We then use KQEs to construct a family of distances that:
(i) are probability metrics under weaker kernel conditions than MMD; (ii)
recover a kernelised form of the sliced Wasserstein distance; and (iii) can be
efficiently estimated with near-linear cost. Through hypothesis testing, we
show that these distances offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast
approximations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将数据流映射到低维表示的方法，该表示能完全表征数据生成分布，并改进了其估计器以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究期望签名（expected signature）的收敛性，以填补离散时间估计与理论连续时间值之间的差距，并提升基于期望签名的机器学习方法的概率解释。

Method: 通过理论分析证明期望签名的收敛性，并提出针对鞅过程的改进估计器，以降低均方误差。

Result: 改进的估计器显著降低了均方误差，并在实际应用中提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 期望签名是一种有效的模型无关嵌入方法，改进后的估计器进一步提升了其在实际应用中的表现。

Abstract: The expected signature maps a collection of data streams to a lower
dimensional representation, with a remarkable property: the resulting feature
tensor can fully characterize the data generating distribution. This
"model-free" embedding has been successfully leveraged to build multiple
domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) algorithms for time series and sequential
data. The convergence results proved in this paper bridge the gap between the
expected signature's empirical discrete-time estimator and its theoretical
continuous-time value, allowing for a more complete probabilistic
interpretation of expected signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when the data
generating process is a martingale, we suggest a simple modification of the
expected signature estimator with significantly lower mean squared error and
empirically demonstrate how it can be effectively applied to improve predictive
performance.

Conclusion: CoDEAL方法有效解决了因果面板数据中的复杂问题，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper studies the task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in
causal panel data models, in the presence of covariate effects. We propose a
novel Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning (CoDEAL) for panel data models,
that employs flexible model structures and powerful neural network
architectures to cohesively deal with the underlying heterogeneity and
nonlinearity of both panel units and covariate effects. The proposed CoDEAL
integrates nonlinear covariate effect components (parameterized by a
feed-forward neural network) with nonlinear factor structures (modeled by a
multi-output autoencoder) to form a heterogeneous causal panel model. The
nonlinear covariate component offers a flexible framework for capturing the
complex influences of covariates on outcomes. The nonlinear factor analysis
enables CoDEAL to effectively capture both cross-sectional and temporal
dependencies inherent in the data panel. This latent structural information is
subsequently integrated into a customized matrix completion algorithm, thereby
facilitating more accurate imputation of missing counterfactual outcomes.
Moreover, the use of a multi-output autoencoder explicitly accounts for
heterogeneity across units and enhances the model interpretability of the
latent factors. We establish theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the
estimated counterfactuals, and demonstrate the compelling performance of the
proposed method using extensive simulation studies and a real data application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定预算或置信度的最佳臂识别方法对实践者来说难以选择，新框架更贴近实际需求，如A/B测试中的利润最大化。

Method: 提出DBCARE算法，通过最小化性能惩罚和采样成本的总和来匹配理论下界。

Result: DBCARE在模拟实验中表现优于传统固定预算或置信度算法。

Conclusion: 新框架和DBCARE算法为最佳臂识别问题提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the best arm in a multi-armed bandit
model. Despite a wealth of literature in the traditional fixed budget and fixed
confidence regimes of the best arm identification problem, it still remains a
mystery to most practitioners as to how to choose an approach and corresponding
budget or confidence parameter. We propose a new formalism to avoid this
dilemma altogether by minimizing a risk functional which explicitly balances
the performance of the recommended arm and the cost incurred by learning this
arm. In this framework, a cost is incurred for each observation during the
sampling phase, and upon recommending an arm, a performance penalty is incurred
for identifying a suboptimal arm. The learner's goal is to minimize the sum of
the penalty and cost. This new regime mirrors the priorities of many
practitioners, e.g. maximizing profit in an A/B testing framework, better than
classical fixed budget or confidence settings. We derive theoretical lower
bounds for the risk of each of two choices for the performance penalty, the
probability of misidentification and the simple regret, and propose an
algorithm called DBCARE to match these lower bounds up to polylog factors on
nearly all problem instances. We then demonstrate the performance of DBCARE on
a number of simulated models, comparing to fixed budget and confidence
algorithms to show the shortfalls of existing BAI paradigms on this problem.

Motivation: 探讨能量距离在分布接近时的敏感性，特别是对均值和协方差差异的响应，以理解其实际应用中的表现。

Method: 分析能量距离的结构，研究其在分布接近时的行为，并通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 能量距离对均值差异更敏感，而对协方差差异的敏感性受维度影响，非对角相关性贡献较小。

Conclusion: 能量距离在分布接近时对均值差异更敏感，协方差差异的敏感性受维度影响，数值结果支持理论分析。

Abstract: The energy distance is used to test distributional equality, and as a loss
function in machine learning. While $D^2(X, Y)=0$ only when $X\sim Y$, the
sensitivity to different moments is of practical importance. This work
considers $D^2(X, Y)$ in the case where the distributions are close. In this
regime, $D^2(X, Y)$ is more sensitive to differences in the means
$\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$, than differences in the covariances $\Delta$. This is due to
the structure of the energy distance and is independent of dimension. The
sensitivity to on versus off diagonal components of $\Delta$ is examined when
$X$ and $Y$ are close to isotropic. Here a dimension dependent averaging occurs
and, in many cases, off diagonal correlations contribute significantly less.
Numerical results verify these relationships hold even when distributional
assumptions are not strictly met.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为fcHMRF-LIS的空间FDR控制方法，用于神经影像数据中的多重检验问题，解决了传统方法在空间依赖性、稳定性和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FDR控制方法在神经影像数据分析中假设检验独立，导致高假阴性率，且无法同时解决空间依赖性、稳定性和计算效率的挑战。

Method: 结合局部显著性指数（LIS）和完全连接的隐马尔可夫随机场（fcHMRF），采用高效的期望最大化算法，降低计算复杂度。

Result: fcHMRF-LIS在模拟中实现了准确的FDR控制、更低的假阴性率、更稳定的FDP和FNP，以及更高的真阳性率。

Conclusion: fcHMRF-LIS在神经影像数据分析中表现出色，具有更高的计算效率和生物学意义。

Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise
multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or
even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with
disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and
LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false
non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have
been developed to improve power, they still fall short in jointly addressing
three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial
dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion
(FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and
achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these
challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR
control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index
of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected
hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial
structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient
expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the
Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and
permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the computational complexity from
quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate
that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability
in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing
methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain
regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标概率分布的近似问题在数值积分、数据压缩和优化中具有基础重要性，但MMD的非凸性使得全局最小化困难。

Method: 考虑MMD的驻点而非全局最小点，并利用离散化梯度流计算这些驻点。

Result: 证明了驻点在某些情况下具有超收敛性，即积分误差比MMD更快趋近于零。

Conclusion: 通过计算MMD的驻点，可以实现更高效的近似，并提出了非渐近有限粒子误差界的新分析。

Abstract: Approximation of a target probability distribution using a finite set of
points is a problem of fundamental importance, arising in cubature, data
compression, and optimisation. Several authors have proposed to select points
by minimising a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), but the non-convexity of this
objective precludes global minimisation in general. Instead, we consider
\emph{stationary} points of the MMD which, in contrast to points globally
minimising the MMD, can be accurately computed. Our main theoretical
contribution is the (perhaps surprising) result that, for integrands in the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the cubature error of stationary
MMD points vanishes \emph{faster} than the MMD. Motivated by this
\emph{super-convergence} property, we consider discretised gradient flows as a
practical strategy for computing stationary points of the MMD, presenting a
refined convergence analysis that establishes a novel non-asymptotic
finite-particle error bound, which may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: ICKAN是一种有效的输入凸神经网络架构，适用于需要凸函数逼近的问题，性能与传统方法相当。

Abstract: This article presents an input convex neural network architecture using
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (ICKAN). Two specific networks are presented: the
first is based on a low-order, linear-by-part, representation of functions, and
a universal approximation theorem is provided. The second is based on cubic
splines, for which only numerical results support convergence. We demonstrate
on simple tests that these networks perform competitively with classical input
convex neural networks (ICNNs). In a second part, we use the networks to solve
some optimal transport problems needing a convex approximation of functions and
demonstrate their effectiveness. Comparisons with ICNNs show that cubic ICKANs
produce results similar to those of classical ICNNs.

Abstract: We propose a principled method for autoencoding with random forests. Our
strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and
spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that
optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and
approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization,
split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively
invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space
back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent
trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common
regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised
models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We
demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new
tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments
illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings,
including tabular, image, and genomic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属增材制造涉及多个环节的复杂关系，但现有知识分散且查询困难，限制了其在设计和规划中的应用。

Method: 开发了一个基于Neo4j的知识图谱，编码了53种金属和合金、9种AM工艺、4种原料类型及后处理需求，并通过LLM实现自然语言查询。

Result: 系统支持兼容性检查、多约束筛选和设计指导，实现了实时交互和结构化响应。

Conclusion: 该系统首次将领域特定的金属AM知识图谱与LLM接口结合，为工程师提供了可访问、可解释的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) involves complex interdependencies among
processes, materials, feedstock, and post-processing steps. However, the
underlying relationships and domain knowledge remain fragmented across
literature and static databases that often demand expert-level queries,
limiting their applicability in design and planning. To address these gaps, we
develop a novel and queryable knowledge graph (KG) in Neo4j, encoding 53
distinct metals and alloys across seven material families, nine AM processes,
four feedstock types, and associated post-processing requirements. A large
language model (LLM) interface, guided by a few-shot prompting strategy,
enables natural language querying without the need for formal query syntax. The
system supports a range of tasks, including compatibility checks,
multi-constraint filtering, and design for AM (DfAM) guidance. User natural
language queries are normalized, translated into Cypher, and executed over the
KG, with results reformatted into structured responses. This work presents the
first real-time, interactive system that integrates a domain-specific metal AM
KG with an LLM interface, offering accessible, explainable decision support for
engineers and advancing human-centric tools in manufacturing intelligence.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型对危险查询的响应不足（undersafety），而忽视了模型拒绝安全查询（oversafety）的问题。

Method: 提出安全校准概念，构建VSCBench数据集（3600对图像-文本），评估11种VLMs的安全校准问题，并尝试四种改进方法。

Result: 实验发现VLMs存在严重的undersafety和oversafety问题，改进方法虽有效但会降低模型实用性。

Conclusion: 安全校准需进一步研究，VSCBench为未来方法评估提供了工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has brought a lot of
attention to their safety alignment. However, existing methods have primarily
focused on model undersafety, where the model responds to hazardous queries,
while neglecting oversafety, where the model refuses to answer safe queries. In
this paper, we introduce the concept of $\textit{safety calibration}$, which
systematically addresses both undersafety and oversafety. Specifically, we
present $\textbf{VSCBench}$, a novel dataset of 3,600 image-text pairs that are
visually or textually similar but differ in terms of safety, which is designed
to evaluate safety calibration across image-centric and text-centric scenarios.
Based on our benchmark, we evaluate safety calibration across eleven widely
used VLMs. Our extensive experiments revealed major issues with both
undersafety and oversafety. We further investigated four approaches to improve
the model's safety calibration. We found that even though some methods
effectively calibrated the models' safety problems, these methods also lead to
the degradation of models' utility. This trade-off underscores the urgent need
for advanced calibration methods, and our benchmark provides a valuable tool
for evaluating future approaches. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化金融文档（如SEC文件）格式相似，传统RAG方法容易误判重复文本，影响检索的准确性和完整性。

Method: HiREC框架通过分层检索（先检索相关文档，再选择最相关段落）和证据整理（去除无关段落，必要时生成补充查询）来优化检索过程。

Result: 构建并发布了包含145,897份SEC文档和1,595个问答对的大规模开放域金融问答基准LOFin。

Conclusion: HiREC框架有效解决了金融文档检索中的重复问题，提升了检索质量，并通过公开代码和数据支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are
widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive
tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats
such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This
similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text,
leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To
address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence
Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval
to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents
and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence
curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically
generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our
approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin)
question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595
question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: RAG方法为基于LLMs的推荐系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the
backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored
the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear
whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative
information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and
classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage
user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in
structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often
fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that
our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation
quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略（"Guidance-Only"和"Tuning-Only"）无法有效弥合LLM与推荐系统之间的知识差距，性能未达预期。

Method: SOFT方法结合自蒸馏和自适应课程学习，先从简单数据（自蒸馏数据）逐步过渡到复杂数据（真实推荐数据）。

Result: 实验表明，SOFT显著提升了基于LLM的推荐方法的准确性（平均提升37.59%）。

Conclusion: SOFT方法通过结合两种策略的优势，有效提升了LLM在推荐系统中的性能。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS). There are currently two
commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1)
The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify
the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of
LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data.
However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the
knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet
our expectations.
  To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the
advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning"
method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of
curriculum learning. It first employs self-distillation to construct an
auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM. Then it
further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to
gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging
data (real RS data). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly
enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table
union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that
can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods
are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic
understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS
benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform
surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This
suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by
dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from
semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for
future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of
progress in semantic table union search.

Result: 该方法在分类任务中表现优异，且参数更少；引用意图过滤显著影响论文在引用网络中的中心性，尤其是介数中心性。

Conclusion: GAN架构结合上下文嵌入在引用意图分类中高效有效，引用意图对论文中心性有重要影响。

Abstract: Citations play a fundamental role in the scientific ecosystem, serving as a
foundation for tracking the flow of knowledge, acknowledging prior work, and
assessing scholarly influence. In scientometrics, they are also central to the
construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the
same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare
results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced
interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based
method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed
method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching
state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with
contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated
whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation
networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found
that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All
four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness
- were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality
displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when
specific citation intents were removed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多保真度迁移学习的方法，减少高质量模拟数据的需求，从而降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模拟的推理（SBI）依赖大量高质量模拟数据，计算成本高昂。

Method: 采用多保真度迁移学习，结合低保真度模拟和少量高保真度模拟。

Result: 在暗物质密度图上验证，高保真模拟需求减少8至15倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能和准确性。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation
when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on
machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires
large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality
simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning,
combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of
high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter
density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS
Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations
reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a
factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior
dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper
simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on
high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用Wavelet Flow（WF）模型建模CMB次级场的概率分布，以优化宇宙学数据分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMB观测中的河外前景既是宇宙学和天体物理信息的来源，也是CMB分析的干扰，需要有效的场级建模以提取最优信息。

Method: 联合训练相关的CMB透镜收敛（κ）和宇宙红外背景（CIB）图，利用WF模型生成高精度样本，并通过多尺度架构优化模型参数和先验。

Result: 训练后的网络生成的κ和CIB场样本的平均功率谱与输入相差仅几个百分点，Minkowski泛函也高度准确。

Conclusion: WF模型能准确模拟CMB次级场的相关成分，支持改进宇宙学数据分析。

Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations
are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance
to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian
statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information
extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from
current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF)
models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability
distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly
train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically
recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of
$\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of
the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly
accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of
these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each
scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These
results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated
components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological
data. Our code and trained models can be found here

Motivation: COVID-19大流行显著增加了40岁以上人群感染后心血管事件的发生率，但其机制尚不明确，因此研究旨在通过数据建模评估风险因素。

Method: 结合人口统计、生化、心电图和铊负荷试验数据，采用聚类算法将人群分为高风险（AR）和非高风险（NAR）组，分析13个关键风险因素。

Result: 研究发现13个风险因素与心脏病发作强相关，尤其是绝经后患者因雌激素减少和外部压力（如焦虑和恐惧）导致风险加剧。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了传统数据建模难以捕捉的风险因素，为高风险人群的识别和干预提供了新视角。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of
post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in
individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study
employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in
assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a
unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium
stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying
risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and
'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals
strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the
13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients
indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that
may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and
fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了20种流行LLM生成的代码在878个编程问题上的能源效率，发现其性能与能源效率普遍低于人工编写的解决方案，其中DeepSeek-v3和GPT-4o表现最佳，而Grok-2和Gemini-1.5-Pro最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM生成的代码功能正确性不断提升，但其能源效率和环境影响常被忽视，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过比较LLM生成的代码与人工编写的规范解决方案在LeetCode平台上的能源消耗，评估了20种LLM的性能。

Result: LLM生成的代码能源效率普遍较低，某些算法类别中能耗甚至高达人工解决方案的450倍。

Conclusion: LLM在代码生成中需进一步优化能源效率，以减少环境影响。

Abstract: As the quality of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) improves,
their adoption in the software industry for automated code generation continues
to grow. Researchers primarily focus on enhancing the functional correctness of
the generated code while commonly overlooking its energy efficiency and
environmental impact. This paper investigates the energy efficiency of the code
generated by 20 popular LLMs for 878 programming problems of varying difficulty
levels and diverse algorithmic categories selected from the LeetCode platform
by comparing them against canonical human-written solutions. Although LLMs can
produce functionally correct results in most cases, our findings show that the
performance and energy efficiency of LLM-produced solutions are often far below
those of human-written solutions. Among the studied LLMs, DeepSeek-v3 and
GPT-4o generate the most energy-efficient code, whereas Grok-2 and
Gemini-1.5-Pro are among the least energy-efficient models. On average,
human-generated canonical solutions are approximately 1.17 times more energy
efficient than DeepSeek-v3, 1.21 times more energy efficient than GPT-4o, and
over 2 times more energy efficient than Grok-2 and Gemini-1.5-Pro. For specific
algorithmic groups such as dynamic programming, backtracking, and bit
manipulation, LLM-generated code can consume up to 450 times more energy than
human-generated canonical solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代C代码需要转译为Rust以提升安全性和互操作性，但缺乏评估转译系统性能的数据集。

Method: 引入CRUST-Bench数据集，包含100个C仓库及其手动编写的安全Rust接口和测试用例，以评估转译系统的性能。

Result: 现有大语言模型在单次尝试下仅能完成15个任务，表明安全且符合惯用法的Rust生成仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: CRUST-Bench为改进转译系统提供了基准，有助于推动从C到Rust的代码迁移。

Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while
enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no
dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into
safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset
of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe
Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the
transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated
functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects
with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide
explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust
patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find
that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for
various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into
the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best
performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot
setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation
systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy
codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了数据稀缺和评估污染问题，为软件工程代理的强化学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of
software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two
critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially
data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with
development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes
of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code
generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive
tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive
SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks
quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to
continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub
repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset
comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for
reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous
supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a
contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare
results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and
show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to
contamination issues.

TL;DR: SWE-Judge是一种新的自动评估指标，用于准确评估LLM生成的软件工件的正确性，通过动态选择多个独立评估策略并集成结果，显著优于现有自动指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法要么依赖人工（高成本、低扩展性），要么自动指标准确性不足，因此需要一种既能扩展又能准确反映生成软件工件正确性的方法。

Method: SWE-Judge定义五种独立评估策略，通过动态团队选择机制集成最优子集，生成最终正确性分数。

Result: 在多个软件工程任务中，SWE-Judge与人工评估的相关性显著提升（5.9%至183.8%），且与人工标注者的一致性接近。

Conclusion: SWE-Judge可作为扩展性强且可靠的替代方案，减少对人工评估的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been
increasingly used to support software developers by generating software
artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately
assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant
challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is
labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, other existing
automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but
they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated
software artifacts.
  In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for
LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the
correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five
distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A
dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of
judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate
SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks,
including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.
These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program
repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge
consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with
improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.
Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are
comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair
tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and
reliable alternative to human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在代码理解和生成方面的进步，准确评估其在源代码漏洞分析中的可靠性变得至关重要。现有研究常忽略结构和语义推理的重要性。

Method: 引入SV-TrustEval-C基准，通过结构推理（评估代码元素间关系）和语义推理（检验逻辑一致性）两个维度评估LLMs。

Result: 当前LLMs在理解复杂代码关系和漏洞分析中表现不佳，更多依赖模式匹配而非逻辑推理。

Conclusion: SV-TrustEval-C基准有效，揭示了提升LLMs推理能力和可信度的关键方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in understanding and generating code,
accurately evaluating their reliability in analyzing source code
vulnerabilities becomes increasingly vital. While studies have examined LLM
capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often
overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for
trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce
SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for
vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through
two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify
relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow
complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in
scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results
show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code
relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern
matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world
vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly
available.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural
language tasks. However, their ability to accurately capture stakeholder
requirements remains a significant challenge for using FMs for software
development. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an
FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having
a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities,
our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers.
This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and
intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined
requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the
often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which
is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation
covering 150 diverse use cases, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately
capture the intents and requirements of stakeholders, articulating them as both
specifications and a step-by-step plan of action. Our findings suggest that the
potential for significant improvements in the software development process
justifies these investments. Our work lays the groundwork for future innovation
in building intent-first development environments, where software makers can
seamlessly collaborate with AIs to create software that truly meets their
needs.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种理论驱动的偏见检测框架和社交刻板印象指数（SSI），用于系统评估文本到图像（T2I）生成模型中的社会偏见。通过审计三个主流T2I模型（DALL-E-3、Midjourney-6.1和Stability AI Core），发现初始输出常包含刻板印象。通过提示优化，偏见显著减少，但用户研究显示刻板印象图像更符合用户预期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I模型具有创意潜力，但它们常复制和放大社会刻板印象（如性别、种族和文化），引发伦理问题。本文旨在系统评估和减少这些偏见。

Method: 提出SSI和偏见检测框架，审计三个T2I模型的100个查询（分地理文化、职业和形容词三类），并通过LLM进行提示优化以减少偏见。

Result: 提示优化显著降低偏见（SSI下降61%-69%），但用户研究显示刻板印象图像更符合预期，提示优化可能限制上下文对齐。

Conclusion: 需平衡伦理去偏见与上下文相关性，呼吁开发支持全球多样性和包容性的T2I系统，同时不牺牲社会复杂性的反映。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, despite their creative potential, T2I
models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those
related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.
This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social
Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.
We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and
Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural,
occupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are
prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions,
cultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our
rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly
reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and
51% for adjectival queries. We complemented our quantitative analysis through a
user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around
AI-generated biased imagery. Our findings reveal a key tension -- although
prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment.
Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned
with their expectations. We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with
contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and
inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天机器人日益用于自我披露，但其框架对用户自我披露的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用混合因子设计，比较熟悉型（记忆过往互动）与陌生型（每次对话为新实体）聊天机器人，分情感与事实披露两阶段实验。

Result: 情感披露时，陌生型更舒适；事实披露时，熟悉型更受欢迎。定性结果显示陌生型提供匿名性，熟悉型需通过低风险事实披露建立信任。

Conclusion: 聊天机器人框架对自我披露的影响因披露类型而异，设计需考虑情境与用户需求。

Abstract: Self-disclosure, the sharing of one's thoughts and feelings, is affected by
the perceived relationship between individuals. While chatbots are increasingly
used for self-disclosure, the impact of a chatbot's framing on users'
self-disclosure remains under-explored. We investigated how a chatbot's
description of its relationship with users, particularly in terms of
ephemerality, affects self-disclosure. Specifically, we compared a Familiar
chatbot, presenting itself as a companion remembering past interactions, with a
Stranger chatbot, presenting itself as a new, unacquainted entity in each
conversation. In a mixed factorial design, participants engaged with either the
Familiar or Stranger chatbot in two sessions across two days, with one
conversation focusing on Emotional- and another Factual-disclosure. When
Emotional-disclosure was sought in the first chatting session,
Stranger-condition participants felt more comfortable self-disclosing. However,
when Factual-disclosure was sought first, these differences were replaced by
more enjoyment among Familiar-condition participants. Qualitative findings
showed Stranger afforded anonymity and reduced judgement, whereas Familiar
sometimes felt intrusive unless rapport was built via low-risk
Factual-disclosure.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems (MAS) are transforming
how humans and AIs collaboratively generate ideas and artifacts. While existing
surveys provide comprehensive overviews of MAS infrastructures, they largely
overlook the dimension of \emph{creativity}, including how novel outputs are
generated and evaluated, how creativity informs agent personas, and how
creative workflows are coordinated. This is the first survey dedicated to
creativity in MAS. We focus on text and image generation tasks, and present:
(1) a taxonomy of agent proactivity and persona design; (2) an overview of
generation techniques, including divergent exploration, iterative refinement,
and collaborative synthesis, as well as relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics; and (3) a discussion of key challenges, such as inconsistent
evaluation standards, insufficient bias mitigation, coordination conflicts, and
the lack of unified benchmarks. This survey offers a structured framework and
roadmap for advancing the development, evaluation, and standardization of
creative MAS.

### [460] [Enhancing Wearable Tap Water Audio Detection through Subclass Annotation in the HD-Epic Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20788)
*Robin Burchard,Kristof Van Laerhoven*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在可穿戴设备中利用声音数据进行人类活动识别的潜力，尤其是水流检测，同时解决了隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，直接记录和保存音频数据不可行，因此需要本地处理数据。水流检测可作为特殊任务增强人类活动识别。

Method: 在HD-Epic数据集中新增了"tap water"标签，并基于现有"water"类别标注了717个样本。训练并评估了两个轻量级分类器。

Result: 新增的"tap water"类别更容易学习，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过本地处理声音数据，可以在保护隐私的同时增强人类活动识别能力，水流检测是一个可行的应用场景。

Abstract: Wearable human activity recognition has been shown to benefit from the
inclusion of acoustic data, as the sounds around a person often contain
valuable context. However, due to privacy concerns, it is usually not ethically
feasible to record and save microphone data from the device, since the audio
could, for instance, also contain private conversations. Rather, the data
should be processed locally, which in turn requires processing power and
consumes energy on the wearable device. One special use case of contextual
information that can be utilized to augment special tasks in human activity
recognition is water flow detection, which can, e.g., be used to aid wearable
hand washing detection. We created a new label called tap water for the
recently released HD-Epic data set, creating 717 hand-labeled annotations of
tap water flow, based on existing annotations of the water class. We analyzed
the relation of tap water and water in the dataset and additionally trained and
evaluated two lightweight classifiers to evaluate the newly added label class,
showing that the new class can be learned more easily.

### [461] [Scheduling with Uncertain Holding Costs and its Application to Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21331)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In content moderation for social media platforms, the cost of delaying the
review of a content is proportional to its view trajectory, which fluctuates
and is apriori unknown. Motivated by such uncertain holding costs, we consider
a queueing model where job states evolve based on a Markov chain with
state-dependent instantaneous holding costs. We demonstrate that in the
presence of such uncertain holding costs, the two canonical algorithmic
principles, instantaneous-cost ($c\mu$-rule) and expected-remaining-cost
($c\mu/\theta$-rule), are suboptimal. By viewing each job as a Markovian
ski-rental problem, we develop a new index-based algorithm,
Opportunity-adjusted Remaining Cost (OaRC), that adjusts to the opportunity of
serving jobs in the future when uncertainty partly resolves. We show that the
regret of OaRC scales as $\tilde{O}(L^{1.5}\sqrt{N})$, where $L$ is the maximum
length of a job's holding cost trajectory and $N$ is the system size. This
regret bound shows that OaRC achieves asymptotic optimality when the system
size $N$ scales to infinity. Moreover, its regret is independent of the
state-space size, which is a desirable property when job states contain
contextual information. We corroborate our results with an extensive simulation
study based on two holding cost patterns (online ads and user-generated
content) that arise in content moderation for social media platforms. Our
simulations based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that OaRC
consistently outperforms existing practice, which is based on the two canonical
algorithmic principles.

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示考试和评分反馈如何通过数学机制抑制学习者的身份稳定和创造力。

Method: 使用Alpay代数II和III框架，定义考试-评分崩溃系统（EGCS），并证明其导致固定点代数无法存在。

Result: 结果表明，考试制度导致学习动态崩溃，阻碍身份稳定和创造力涌现。

Conclusion: 论文首次用代数方法证明了制度反馈机制对身份形成的阻碍作用。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal categorical proof that exam-driven educational
systems obstruct identity emergence and block creative convergence. Using the
framework of Alpay Algebra II and III, we define Exam-Grade Collapse Systems
(EGCS) as functorial constructs where learning dynamics $\varphi$ are
recursively collapsed by evaluative morphisms $E$. We prove that under such
collapse regimes, no nontrivial fixed-point algebra $\mu_\varphi$ can exist,
hence learner identity cannot stabilize. This creates a universal fixed-point
trap: all generative functors are entropically folded before symbolic emergence
occurs. Our model mathematically explains the creativity suppression, research
stagnation, and structural entropy loss induced by timed exams and grade-based
feedback. The results apply category theory to expose why modern educational
systems prevent {\phi}-emergence and block observer-invariant self-formation.
This work provides the first provable algebraic obstruction of identity
formation caused by institutional feedback mechanics.

Motivation: 研究散射变换在非欧几里得空间（如有限群）上的扩展，以增强卷积神经网络在群等变任务中的性能。

Method: 引入有限群上的小波，构建散射变换，并分析其非扩张性、稳定性、能量保持性和等变性等性质。

Result: 证明了散射变换在特定条件下具有非扩张性、稳定性、能量保持性和等变性，且随着深度增加，对群平移的敏感性降低。

Conclusion: 散射变换在有限群上具有类似经典小波的性质，适用于分类任务，尤其在非阿贝尔群数据上表现良好。

Abstract: Scattering Networks were initially designed to elucidate the behavior of
early layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over Euclidean spaces and
are grounded in wavelets. In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on
an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of
group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets
on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We
demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the
scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves
energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as
depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group
translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural
networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the
scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and
nonabelian groups.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的值迭代方法（VI），用于解决双人零和并发随机博弈（CSGs）中的可达性和安全性目标问题，通过引入上下界逼近序列确保近似精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VI方法在终止时缺乏对近似精度的保证，因此需要一种能够提供精确近似的方法。

Method: 提出了一种有界（区间）VI方法，通过补充标准VI的上下界逼近序列，并在上下界逼近足够接近时终止。

Result: 该方法能够确保近似精度，并在实践中优于传统的VI方法。

Conclusion: 有界VI方法为CSGs提供了一种更可靠的解决方案，弥补了传统VI在精度保证上的不足。

Abstract: We consider two-player zero-sum concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) played on
graphs with reachability and safety objectives. These include degenerate
classes such as Markov decision processes or turn-based stochastic games, which
can be solved by linear or quadratic programming; however, in practice, value
iteration (VI) outperforms the other approaches and is the most implemented
method. Similarly, for CSGs, this practical performance makes VI an attractive
alternative to the standard theoretical solution via the existential theory of
reals.
  VI starts with an under-approximation of the sought values for each state and
iteratively updates them, traditionally terminating once two consecutive
approximations are $\epsilon$-close. However, this stopping criterion lacks
guarantees on the precision of the approximation, which is the goal of this
work. We provide bounded (a.k.a. interval) VI for CSGs: it complements standard
VI with a converging sequence of over-approximations and terminates once the
over- and under-approximations are $\epsilon$-close.

Motivation: 由于缺乏统一的PDE数据集和标准化评估协议，数据驱动的流体动力学建模难以公平比较。FD-Bench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FD-Bench通过模块化设计（空间、时间和损失模块）评估85个基线模型，涵盖10种代表性流动场景，并提供系统框架与传统数值求解器直接比较。

Result: FD-Bench建立了迄今为止最全面的排行榜，解决了可复现性和可比性问题，为未来数据驱动流体模型的评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: FD-Bench为数据驱动流体模拟提供了公平、模块化和可扩展的基准测试，推动了该领域的标准化和未来发展。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of fluid dynamics has advanced rapidly with neural PDE
solvers, yet a fair and strong benchmark remains fragmented due to the absence
of unified PDE datasets and standardized evaluation protocols. Although
architectural innovations are abundant, fair assessment is further impeded by
the lack of clear disentanglement between spatial, temporal and loss modules.
In this paper, we introduce FD-Bench, the first fair, modular, comprehensive
and reproducible benchmark for data-driven fluid simulation. FD-Bench
systematically evaluates 85 baseline models across 10 representative flow
scenarios under a unified experimental setup. It provides four key
contributions: (1) a modular design enabling fair comparisons across spatial,
temporal, and loss function modules; (2) the first systematic framework for
direct comparison with traditional numerical solvers; (3) fine-grained
generalization analysis across resolutions, initial conditions, and temporal
windows; and (4) a user-friendly, extensible codebase to support future
research. Through rigorous empirical studies, FD-Bench establishes the most
comprehensive leaderboard to date, resolving long-standing issues in
reproducibility and comparability, and laying a foundation for robust
evaluation of future data-driven fluid models. The code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: ST-PINNs为复杂间断问题提供新解决方案，扩展了PINNs的应用范围。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
in scientific computing, they continue to face challenges when solving
hydrodynamic problems with multiple discontinuities. In this work, we propose
Separation-Transfer Physics Informed Neural Networks (ST-PINNs) to address such
problems. By sequentially resolving discontinuities from strong to weak and
leveraging transfer learning during training, ST-PINNs significantly reduce the
problem complexity and enhance solution accuracy. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to apply a PINNs-based approach to the two-dimensional
unsteady planar shock refraction problem, offering new insights into the
application of PINNs to complex shock-interface interactions. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that ST-PINNs more accurately capture sharp
discontinuities and substantially reduce solution errors in hydrodynamic
problems involving multiple discontinuities.

Conclusion: GraphGPS框架在物理信息机器学习中表现出色，能够有效重建复杂流体流动特征，为相关逆问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In compressible fluid flow, reconstructing shocks, discontinuities,
rarefactions, and their interactions from sparse measurements is an important
inverse problem with practical applications. Moreover, physics-informed machine
learning has recently become an increasingly popular approach for performing
reconstructions tasks. In this work we explore a machine learning recipe, known
as GraphGPS, for reconstructing canonical compressible flows known as 3D
Riemann problems from sparse observations, in a physics-informed manner. The
GraphGPS framework combines the benefits of positional encodings, local
message-passing of graphs, and global contextual awareness, and we explore the
latter two components through an ablation study. Furthermore, we modify the
aggregation step of message-passing such that it is aware of shocks and
discontinuities, resulting in sharper reconstructions of these features.
Additionally, we modify message-passing such that information flows strictly
from known nodes only, which results in computational savings, better training
convergence, and no degradation of reconstruction accuracy. We also show that
the GraphGPS framework outperforms numerous machine learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ETooL的新型加密流量表示模型，通过结合大型语言模型（LLM）和自监督指令调优，解决了现有方法在分布漂移和依赖标记数据方面的局限性。ETooL在监督和零样本任务中表现出更强的分类性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加密流量分类方法面临分布漂移和依赖标记数据的问题，限制了其在真实场景中的适应性。LLMs虽在多领域表现出色，但在流量分析中仍受限于领域特定需求。

Method: 提出ETooL模型，通过自监督指令调优将LLMs与流量结构知识结合，建立文本信息与流量交互的联系。

Result: ETooL在多个数据集上显著提升F1分数，如APP53（I.I.D.）达93.19%，APP53（O.O.D.）达74.88%，ISCX-Botnet（O.O.D.）达95.03%。

Conclusion: ETooL通过指令调优和动态数据集NETD验证了其在分布漂移条件下的有效性，为加密流量分类提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security
due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic
data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused
by reliance on the closedworld assumption, limits adaptability to realworld,
shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability
where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a
wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields.
However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by
challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In
this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted
Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which
integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised
instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between
textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust
classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and
zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant
improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%),
APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.)
to 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic
dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to
validate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions.
Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's
instruction tuning approach.

Result: 在Claude-3.5上实现了超过90%的成功率，且具有跨模型迁移能力，超越了专业防护模型的评估准确性。

Conclusion: 扩展策略空间是提升越狱攻击能力的关键，新框架为模型安全性研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advanced general capabilities, still
suffer from numerous safety risks, especially jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety protocols. Understanding these vulnerabilities through black-box
jailbreak attacks, which better reflect real-world scenarios, offers critical
insights into model robustness. While existing methods have shown improvements
through various prompt engineering techniques, their success remains limited
against safety-aligned models, overlooking a more fundamental problem: the
effectiveness is inherently bounded by the predefined strategy spaces. However,
expanding this space presents significant challenges in both systematically
capturing essential attack patterns and efficiently navigating the increased
complexity. To better explore the potential of expanding the strategy space, we
address these challenges through a novel framework that decomposes jailbreak
strategies into essential components based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model
(ELM) theory and develops genetic-based optimization with intention evaluation
mechanisms. To be striking, our experiments reveal unprecedented jailbreak
capabilities by expanding the strategy space: we achieve over 90% success rate
on Claude-3.5 where prior methods completely fail, while demonstrating strong
cross-model transferability and surpassing specialized safeguard models in
evaluation accuracy. The code is open-sourced at:

Conclusion: 本文揭示了扩散模型中高频信息处理缺陷对MIAs的影响，并提出了一种有效的解决方案，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation, but
they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy and copyright issues.
Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific
data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for
diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we
formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership
score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find
that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models
process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to
member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out
data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be
misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this
deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering
with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on
this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to
mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly
integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional
time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly
improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and
models.

Conclusion: 广告投放是Web Agent环境注入攻击的有效途径，亟需开发防御机制应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) based Web Agents represent a significant step
towards automating complex tasks by simulating human-like interaction with
websites. However, their deployment in uncontrolled web environments introduces
significant security vulnerabilities. Existing research on adversarial
environmental injection attacks often relies on unrealistic assumptions, such
as direct HTML manipulation, knowledge of user intent, or access to agent model
parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
AdInject, a novel and real-world black-box attack method that leverages the
internet advertising delivery to inject malicious content into the Web Agent's
environment. AdInject operates under a significantly more realistic threat
model than prior work, assuming a black-box agent, static malicious content
constraints, and no specific knowledge of user intent. AdInject includes
strategies for designing malicious ad content aimed at misleading agents into
clicking, and a VLM-based ad content optimization technique that infers
potential user intents from the target website's context and integrates these
intents into the ad content to make it appear more relevant or critical to the
agent's task, thus enhancing attack effectiveness. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of AdInject, attack success rates exceeding 60%
in most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases. This strongly
demonstrates that prevalent advertising delivery constitutes a potent and
real-world vector for environment injection attacks against Web Agents. This
work highlights a critical vulnerability in Web Agent security arising from
real-world environment manipulation channels, underscoring the urgent need for
developing robust defense mechanisms against such threats. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NicerWang/AdInject.

### [1] [More Thinking, Less Seeing? Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21523)
*Chengzhi Liu,Zhongxing Xu,Qingyue Wei,Juncheng Wu,James Zou,Xin Eric Wang,Yuyin Zhou,Sheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大语言模型在长推理链中视觉基础减弱导致的幻觉问题，提出了RH-AUC指标和RH-Bench基准，发现模型大小和训练数据类型对平衡推理与感知的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在长推理链中表现提升，但伴随视觉基础减弱和幻觉增加，需系统研究此现象。

Method: 引入RH-AUC指标量化模型感知准确性随推理长度的变化，并发布RH-Bench基准评估推理能力与幻觉的权衡。

Result: 较大模型在推理与感知间平衡更好，且平衡受训练数据类型影响大于数据量。

Conclusion: 需联合评估推理质量与感知保真度的框架，强调训练数据类型的优化重要性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate
extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as
multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes
with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to
drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language
priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced
focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically
study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a
model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to
evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also
release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal
tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and
hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a
better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is
influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall
volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that
jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

### [2] [Loquacious Set: 25,000 Hours of Transcribed and Diverse English Speech Recognition Data for Research and Commercial Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21578)
*Titouan Parcollet,Yuan Tseng,Shucong Zhang,Rogier van Dalen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Loquacious Set是一个25,000小时的商用英语语音数据集，解决了现有ASR数据集的局限性，适用于学术界和工业界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR数据集（如LibriSpeech）在规模和多样性上存在不足，且新数据集存在许可或质量问题，限制了研究进展。

Method: 提出了Loquacious Set，一个包含多样口音和语音类型的商用数据集。

Result: Loquacious Set提供了25,000小时的多样化语音数据，支持真实场景下的ASR系统开发。

Conclusion: Loquacious Set填补了现有数据集的空白，为ASR研究提供了更实用的资源。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) research is driven by the availability of
common datasets between industrial researchers and academics, encouraging
comparisons and evaluations. LibriSpeech, despite its long success as an ASR
benchmark, is now limited by its size and focus on clean, read speech, leading
to near-zero word error rates. More recent datasets, including MOSEL, YODAS,
Gigaspeech, OWSM, Libriheavy or People's Speech suffer from major limitations
including licenses that researchers in the industry cannot use, unreliable
transcriptions, incorrect audio data, or the lack of evaluation sets. This work
presents the Loquacious Set, a 25,000-hour curated collection of commercially
usable English speech. Featuring hundreds of thousands of speakers with diverse
accents and a wide range of speech types (read, spontaneous, talks, clean,
noisy), the Loquacious Set is designed to work for academics and researchers in
the industry to build ASR systems in real-world scenarios.

### [3] [Rethinking Data Mixture for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21598)
*Yajiao Liu,Congliang Chen,Junchi Yang,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在固定训练预算下如何优化不同数据域的采样比例以提升模型性能，并提出了对现有数据混合方法的细粒度分类和总结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在有限计算资源下通过优化数据域的采样比例来训练性能最佳的模型。

Method: 提出了对现有数据混合方法的细粒度分类，包括离线方法（启发式、算法式和函数拟合式）和在线方法（在线最小最大优化、在线混合定律等），并总结了问题表述和代表性算法。

Result: 总结了各类方法的优缺点，并明确了它们之间的关系与区别。

Conclusion: 论文为数据混合领域提供了全面的方法分类和总结，并指出了该领域的关键挑战。

Abstract: Training large language models with data collected from various domains can
improve their performance on downstream tasks. However, given a fixed training
budget, the sampling proportions of these different domains significantly
impact the model's performance. How can we determine the domain weights across
different data domains to train the best-performing model within constrained
computational resources? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of
existing data mixture methods. First, we propose a fine-grained categorization
of existing methods, extending beyond the previous offline and online
classification. Offline methods are further grouped into heuristic-based,
algorithm-based, and function fitting-based methods. For online methods, we
categorize them into three groups: online min-max optimization, online mixing
law, and other approaches by drawing connections with the optimization
frameworks underlying offline methods. Second, we summarize the problem
formulations, representative algorithms for each subtype of offline and online
methods, and clarify the relationships and distinctions among them. Finally, we
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and highlight key
challenges in the field of data mixture.

### [4] [R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large Model Token Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21600)
*Tianyu Fu,Yi Ge,Yichen You,Enshu Liu,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Shengen Yan,Huazhong Yang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为R2R的神经令牌路由方法，通过选择性使用大语言模型（LLMs）处理关键令牌，显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）推理开销大，部署困难；而蒸馏后的小语言模型（SLMs）效率高但性能不足。研究发现仅少数令牌会导致推理路径分歧，因此提出R2R方法。

Method: R2R是一种神经令牌路由方法，仅对关键令牌使用LLMs，其余令牌由SLM生成。同时开发了自动数据生成管道，用于训练轻量级路由器。

Result: 在数学、编程和问答任务上，R2R平均激活参数为5.6B，性能超过R1-7B的1.6倍，甚至优于R1-14B，同时比R1-32B快2.8倍。

Conclusion: R2R显著提升了推理效率，推动了测试时扩展效率的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the
cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment
challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly
enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs'
reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens
genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens
are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations
in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads
to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs
only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of
token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation
pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing
labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and
R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math,
coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B,
R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the
R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with
comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling
efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/R2R.

### [5] [How does Misinformation Affect Large Language Model Behaviors and Preferences?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21608)
*Miao Peng,Nuo Chen,Jianheng Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MisBench是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在错误信息中行为和知识偏好的大规模基准测试，揭示了LLMs在知识冲突和风格变化中的脆弱性，并提出了一种新方法RtD来增强其检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLMs在错误信息中具体表现和受影响程度的细粒度分析，因此需要建立一个全面的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了MisBench基准测试，包含10,346,712条错误信息，结合知识冲突和风格变化，并提出了Reconstruct to Discriminate（RtD）方法来增强LLMs的检测能力。

Result: 实证结果显示，LLMs在辨别错误信息方面表现相当，但仍易受知识冲突和风格变化的影响。

Conclusion: MisBench为LLMs与错误信息的交互提供了重要见解，可作为评估LLM检测器的有效基准，并提升其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
knowledge-intensive tasks, while they remain vulnerable when encountering
misinformation. Existing studies have explored the role of LLMs in combating
misinformation, but there is still a lack of fine-grained analysis on the
specific aspects and extent to which LLMs are influenced by misinformation. To
bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' behavior and knowledge preference
toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of
misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and
stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while
LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still
remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on
these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to
Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen LLMs' ability to detect misinformation. Our
study provides valuable insights into LLMs' interactions with misinformation,
and we believe MisBench can serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating
LLM-based detectors and enhancing their reliability in real-world applications.

### [6] [Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21646)
*Lei Zhang,Markus Stricker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种迭代框架，通过选择多样化文档、训练Word2Vec模型，并监测嵌入空间中成分-性质关联的收敛性，加速材料发现与优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料发现中的组合爆炸问题导致数据稀缺，现有科学文本中的潜在知识未充分利用。

Method: 采用迭代框架，结合多样化文档选择、Word2Vec模型训练及嵌入空间监测，预测高性能材料。

Result: 成功预测了氧还原、氢析出和氧析出反应中的高性能材料，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 迭代语料库优化方法为材料发现提供了高效工具，尤其在数据稀缺的大规模组合空间中。

Abstract: The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is
hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations
and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By
nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be
used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge
in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an
iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic
selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and
monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding
space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen
reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions
for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully
predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates,
validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in
the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus
refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a
scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where
reliable data are scarce or non-existent.

### [7] [Explainability of Large Language Models using SMILE: Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21657)
*Zeinab Dehghani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Adil Khan,Mohammed Naveed Akram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE是一种新方法，用于解释大型语言模型（如GPT、LLAMA和Claude）如何响应提示的不同部分，通过可视化热图展示哪些部分影响最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏透明度，尤其在需要信任和责任的领域，这可能导致问题。

Method: SMILE通过微调输入并测量输出变化，生成可视化热图，突出显示提示中影响最大的部分。

Result: 测试表明，SMILE在准确性、一致性、稳定性和保真度方面提供了清晰可靠的解释。

Conclusion: SMILE通过提高模型的可理解性，使AI更透明和可信。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly
powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to
understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be
problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To
help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models
respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by
slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then
highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps
showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several
leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and
fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these
models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more
transparent and trustworthy.

### [8] [Rethinking the Outlier Distribution in Large Language Models: An In-depth Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21670)
*Rahul Raman,Khushi Sharma,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型（LLM）中的异常值，探讨其形成机制并提出缓解策略，以提高量化效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常值对LLM性能（如量化和压缩）有显著影响，可能导致量化误差和性能下降。研究其成因并提出解决方案有助于优化模型部署。

Method: 全面调查异常值的形成机制，并提出消除大规模激活和通道异常值的有效方法。

Result: 提出了高效方法，能够以最小精度损失消除大多数大规模激活和通道异常值。

Conclusion: 通过深入研究异常值成因并提出缓解策略，本文为LLM的量化优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Investigating outliers in large language models (LLMs) is crucial due to
their significant impact on various aspects of LLM performance, including
quantization and compression. Outliers often cause considerable quantization
errors, leading to degraded model performance. Identifying and addressing these
outliers can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the quantization process,
enabling smoother deployment on edge devices or specialized hardware. Recent
studies have identified two common types of outliers in LLMs: massive
activations and channel-wise outliers. While numerous quantization algorithms
have been proposed to mitigate their effects and maintain satisfactory
accuracy, few have thoroughly explored the root causes of these outliers in
depth. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the
formation mechanisms of these outliers and propose potential strategies to
mitigate their occurrence. Ultimately, we introduce some efficient approaches
to eliminate most massive activations and channel-wise outliers with minimal
impact on accuracy.

### [9] [LLMPR: A Novel LLM-Driven Transfer Learning based Petition Ranking Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21689)
*Avijit Gayen,Somyajit Chakraborty,Mainak Sen,Soham Paul,Angshuman Jana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出LLMPR框架，利用大语言模型和机器学习自动为法律请愿书分配优先级，显著提高司法效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度司法系统中未解决案件的积累导致司法延迟，手动优先级分配效率低且存在主观偏见。

Method: 使用ILDC数据集，结合文本嵌入技术（如DistilBERT、LegalBERT）和定量指标，训练多种机器学习模型（如随机森林、决策树）。

Result: 随机森林和决策树模型表现最佳，准确率超99%，Spearman秩相关为0.99。数值特征模型已接近最优。

Conclusion: 自动化请愿书排名可优化司法流程，减少案件积压，提高公平性。

Abstract: The persistent accumulation of unresolved legal cases, especially within the
Indian judiciary, significantly hampers the timely delivery of justice. Manual
methods of prioritizing petitions are often prone to inefficiencies and
subjective biases further exacerbating delays. To address this issue, we
propose LLMPR (Large Language Model-based Petition Ranking), an automated
framework that utilizes transfer learning and machine learning to assign
priority rankings to legal petitions based on their contextual urgency.
Leveraging the ILDC dataset comprising 7,593 annotated petitions, we process
unstructured legal text and extract features through various embedding
techniques, including DistilBERT, LegalBERT, and MiniLM. These textual
embeddings are combined with quantitative indicators such as gap days, rank
scores, and word counts to train multiple machine learning models, including
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Our experiments
demonstrate that Random Forest and Decision Tree models yield superior
performance, with accuracy exceeding 99% and a Spearman rank correlation of
0.99. Notably, models using only numerical features achieve nearly optimal
ranking results (R2 = 0.988, \r{ho} = 0.998), while LLM-based embeddings offer
only marginal gains. These findings suggest that automated petition ranking can
effectively streamline judicial workflows, reduce case backlog, and improve
fairness in legal prioritization.

### [10] [MAKIEval: A Multilingual Automatic WiKidata-based Framework for Cultural Awareness Evaluation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21693)
*Raoyuan Zhao,Beiduo Chen,Barbara Plank,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAKIEval是一个自动多语言框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言、地区和文化主题中的文化意识。它通过链接结构化知识自动识别文化实体，并引入四个指标评估文化意识的多个维度。研究发现，模型在英语中表现出更强的文化意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的英语预训练可能导致跨语言文化意识差异和偏见输出，但缺乏全面的多语言评估工具。

Method: 利用Wikidata的多语言结构作为跨语言锚点，自动识别模型输出中的文化实体并链接到结构化知识，无需人工标注或翻译。引入四个指标（粒度、多样性、文化特异性和跨语言共识）评估文化意识。

Result: 评估了7个LLMs在13种语言、19个国家和地区、6个文化主题下的表现，发现模型在英语中文化意识更强。

Conclusion: MAKIEval为多语言文化意识评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，揭示了LLMs在非英语语言中的文化意识不足，并公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used globally across many languages, but
their English-centric pretraining raises concerns about cross-lingual
disparities for cultural awareness, often resulting in biased outputs. However,
comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited
benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these
disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for
evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics.
MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express
culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's
multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies
cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge,
enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or
translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary
dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity,
and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts
of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13
languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g.,
food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural
awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate
culturally grounded knowledge. We publicly release our code and data.

*Raoyuan Zhao,Abdullatif Köksal,Ali Modarressi,Michael A. Hedderich,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于输入变化和定量指标的新方法，评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）知识缺口探测的可靠性，揭示了探测方法在内部和跨方法间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题严重影响了其可靠性，因此需要精确识别其知识缺口。现有探测方法存在不一致性问题，亟需评估和改进。

Method: 提出了一种基于输入变化和定量指标的新评估过程，通过非语义扰动和跨方法对比，分析知识缺口探测的可靠性。

Result: 发现探测方法存在两种不一致性：1）同一方法内，微小非语义扰动导致探测结果显著差异（如选项顺序变化使一致性降至40%）；2）不同方法间对同一问题的判断高度不一致（一致性低至7%）。

Conclusion: 现有知识缺口探测方法存在严重的不一致性问题，亟需开发更具扰动鲁棒性的探测框架。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) is greatly compromised by
their tendency to hallucinate, underscoring the need for precise identification
of knowledge gaps within LLMs. Various methods for probing such gaps exist,
ranging from calibration-based to prompting-based methods. To evaluate these
probing methods, in this paper, we propose a new process based on using input
variations and quantitative metrics. Through this, we expose two dimensions of
inconsistency in knowledge gap probing. (1) Intra-method inconsistency: Minimal
non-semantic perturbations in prompts lead to considerable variance in detected
knowledge gaps within the same probing method; e.g., the simple variation of
shuffling answer options can decrease agreement to around 40%. (2) Cross-method
inconsistency: Probing methods contradict each other on whether a model knows
the answer. Methods are highly inconsistent -- with decision consistency across
methods being as low as 7% -- even though the model, dataset, and prompt are
all the same. These findings challenge existing probing methods and highlight
the urgent need for perturbation-robust probing frameworks.

*Barbarestani Baran,Maks Isa,Vossen Piek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了ChatGPT在识别在线评论中的目标和不当语言方面的有效性，发现其在检测不当内容上表现良好，但在目标语言检测上存在变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体上用户生成内容的大量增加，AI在内容审核中的作用日益重要。

Method: 通过将ChatGPT的表现与众包标注和专家评估进行比较，评估其准确性、检测范围和一致性。

Result: ChatGPT在检测不当内容上表现良好，但在目标语言检测上存在较高的假阳性率。

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI模型在内容审核中的潜力，同时指出需要进一步改进模型和上下文理解。

Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an advanced AI model for
natural language processing, in identifying targeting and inappropriate
language in online comments. With the increasing challenge of moderating vast
volumes of user-generated content on social network sites, the role of AI in
content moderation has gained prominence. We compared ChatGPT's performance
against crowd-sourced annotations and expert evaluations to assess its
accuracy, scope of detection, and consistency. Our findings highlight that
ChatGPT performs well in detecting inappropriate content, showing notable
improvements in accuracy through iterative refinements, particularly in Version
6. However, its performance in targeting language detection showed variability,
with higher false positive rates compared to expert judgments. This study
contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of AI models like
ChatGPT to enhance automated content moderation systems while also identifying
areas for further improvement. The results underscore the importance of
continuous model refinement and contextual understanding to better support
automated moderation and mitigate harmful online behavior.

### [13] [Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21740)
*Marvin Limpijankit,Yanda Chen,Melanie Subbiah,Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs的解释能力在生成任务中表现不一，新闻摘要中表现较好，但医学建议中仍有改进空间。反事实模拟性评估更适合技能型任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的输出对提示微小变化敏感，其解释行为的准确性在高风险场景中至关重要。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，将反事实模拟性评估扩展到生成任务，以新闻摘要和医学建议为例。

Result: LLM解释在新闻摘要中帮助用户预测输出，但在医学建议中效果有限。反事实模拟性评估更适用于技能型任务。

Conclusion: LLM解释能力需进一步提升，反事实模拟性评估方法更适合技能型任务而非知识型任务。

Abstract: LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause
the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to
accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes
settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual
simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's
output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been
previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general
framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news
summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while
LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on
counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for
improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the
evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for
skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.

*Yubin Kim,Zhiyuan Hu,Hyewon Jeong,Eugene Park,Shuyue Stella Li,Chanwoo Park,Shiyun Xiong,MingYu Lu,Hyeonhoon Lee,Xin Liu,Daniel McDuff,Cynthia Breazeal,Samir Tulebaev,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BehaviorBench数据集和BehaviorSFT训练策略，用于评估和改进大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床任务中的主动行为表现，实验显示BehaviorSFT显著提升了模型的主动性和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在临床任务中表现优秀，但缺乏主动行为（如未提示的风险识别），需要改进以适应实际需求。

Method: 提出BehaviorBench数据集评估行为表现，并设计BehaviorSFT训练策略，通过行为标记动态调整LLMs行为。

Result: BehaviorSFT显著提升性能（Macro F1达97.3%），临床评估显示其行为更贴近实际需求。

Conclusion: BehaviorSFT有效平衡了主动性和克制性，优于传统微调方法，适用于临床LLMs的优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as clinical agents require careful behavioral
adaptation. While adept at reactive tasks (e.g., diagnosis reasoning), LLMs
often struggle with proactive engagement, like unprompted identification of
critical missing information or risks. We introduce BehaviorBench, a
comprehensive dataset to evaluate agent behaviors across a clinical assistance
spectrum, ranging from reactive query responses to proactive interventions
(e.g., clarifying ambiguities, flagging overlooked critical data). Our
BehaviorBench experiments reveal LLMs' inconsistent proactivity. To address
this, we propose BehaviorSFT, a novel training strategy using behavioral tokens
to explicitly condition LLMs for dynamic behavioral selection along this
spectrum. BehaviorSFT boosts performance, achieving up to 97.3% overall Macro
F1 on BehaviorBench and improving proactive task scores (e.g., from 95.0% to
96.5% for Qwen2.5-7B-Ins). Crucially, blind clinician evaluations confirmed
BehaviorSFT-trained agents exhibit more realistic clinical behavior, striking a
superior balance between helpful proactivity (e.g., timely, relevant
suggestions) and necessary restraint (e.g., avoiding over-intervention) versus
standard fine-tuning or explicit instructed agents.

TL;DR: CCPS通过分析LLMs内部表示稳定性，显著提升了模型置信度校准效果，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的置信度校准问题影响其可靠性，需要更准确的置信度估计方法。

Method: CCPS通过对抗扰动隐藏状态，提取特征并利用轻量级分类器预测答案正确性。

Result: 在多个LLM和MMLU变体上，CCPS显著降低校准误差和Brier分数，同时提升准确率和AUC指标。

Conclusion: CCPS提供了一种高效、广泛适用且更准确的LLM置信度估计方法，增强了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Miscalibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) undermines their reliability,
highlighting the need for accurate confidence estimation. We introduce CCPS
(Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability), a
novel method analyzing internal representational stability in LLMs. CCPS
applies targeted adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, extracts
features reflecting the model's response to these perturbations, and uses a
lightweight classifier to predict answer correctness. CCPS was evaluated on
LLMs from 8B to 32B parameters (covering Llama, Qwen, and Mistral
architectures) using MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks in both multiple-choice and
open-ended formats. Our results show that CCPS significantly outperforms
current approaches. Across four LLMs and three MMLU variants, CCPS reduces
Expected Calibration Error by approximately 55% and Brier score by 21%, while
increasing accuracy by 5 percentage points, Area Under the Precision-Recall
Curve by 4 percentage points, and Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve by 6 percentage points, all relative to the strongest
prior method. CCPS delivers an efficient, broadly applicable, and more accurate
solution for estimating LLM confidence, thereby improving their
trustworthiness.

Motivation: 研究低资源语言对的语音翻译任务，探索如何通过微调SeamlessM4T-v2模型提升性能。

Method: 使用SeamlessM4T-v2进行自动语音识别（ASR）、机器翻译（MT）和端到端语音翻译（E2E ST）的微调，并尝试多种训练范式。

Result: 直接端到端微调效果最好；使用微调后的ASR编码器初始化可提升未训练语言的性能；多任务训练略有帮助。

Conclusion: 直接端到端微调是低资源语音翻译任务的有效方法，ASR编码器初始化和多任务训练可作为补充策略。

Abstract: This paper describes the GMU systems for the IWSLT 2025 low-resource speech
translation shared task. We trained systems for all language pairs, except for
Levantine Arabic. We fine-tuned SeamlessM4T-v2 for automatic speech recognition
(ASR), machine translation (MT), and end-to-end speech translation (E2E ST).
The ASR and MT models are also used to form cascaded ST systems. Additionally,
we explored various training paradigms for E2E ST fine-tuning, including direct
E2E fine-tuning, multi-task training, and parameter initialization using
components from fine-tuned ASR and/or MT models. Our results show that (1)
direct E2E fine-tuning yields strong results; (2) initializing with a
fine-tuned ASR encoder improves ST performance on languages SeamlessM4T-v2 has
not been trained on; (3) multi-task training can be slightly helpful.

TL;DR: 论文提出VeriTrail方法，用于检测多步生成过程中的幻觉内容，并提供可追溯性，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在遵循源材料时仍可能生成无依据内容（封闭域幻觉），多步生成过程（MGS）中风险更高。需检测最终输出并追踪幻觉引入点。

Method: 提出VeriTrail方法，设计首个封闭域幻觉检测方法，支持MGS和单步生成（SGS）过程的可追溯性，并引入包含中间输出和人工标注的数据集。

Result: VeriTrail在两个数据集上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VeriTrail能有效检测和追踪幻觉内容，为多步生成过程提供重要工具。

Abstract: Even when instructed to adhere to source material, Language Models often
generate unsubstantiated content - a phenomenon known as "closed-domain
hallucination." This risk is amplified in processes with multiple generative
steps (MGS), compared to processes with a single generative step (SGS).
However, due to the greater complexity of MGS processes, we argue that
detecting hallucinations in their final outputs is necessary but not
sufficient: it is equally important to trace where hallucinated content was
likely introduced and how faithful content may have been derived from the
source through intermediate outputs. To address this need, we present
VeriTrail, the first closed-domain hallucination detection method designed to
provide traceability for both MGS and SGS processes. We also introduce the
first datasets to include all intermediate outputs as well as human annotations
of final outputs' faithfulness for their respective MGS processes. We
demonstrate that VeriTrail outperforms baseline methods on both datasets.

*Amr Keleg,Sharon Goldwater,Walid Magdy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了阿拉伯语方言多样性及其在NLP任务中的假设，发现这些假设过于简化且不准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证阿拉伯语方言在NLP任务中的常见假设是否准确，以推动相关研究的进展。

Method: 通过扩展和分析多标签数据集，手动评估11种国家级别方言的句子有效性。

Result: 分析表明四种假设过于简化现实，部分假设并不总是准确。

Conclusion: 这些假设可能阻碍阿拉伯语NLP任务的进一步进展。

Abstract: Arabic has diverse dialects, where one dialect can be substantially different
from the others. In the NLP literature, some assumptions about these dialects
are widely adopted (e.g., ``Arabic dialects can be grouped into distinguishable
regional dialects") and are manifested in different computational tasks such as
Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). However, these assumptions are not
quantitatively verified. We identify four of these assumptions and examine them
by extending and analyzing a multi-label dataset, where the validity of each
sentence in 11 different country-level dialects is manually assessed by
speakers of these dialects. Our analysis indicates that the four assumptions
oversimplify reality, and some of them are not always accurate. This in turn
might be hindering further progress in different Arabic NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决生成模型中的多样性和偏见问题，扩展了现有的生成理论框架。

Method: 引入“代表性生成”概念，定义“群体闭包维度”作为关键组合量，分析信息论和计算可行性。

Result: 证明了在特定条件下对可数无限假设类和群体集合的可行性，但也展示了仅使用成员查询的不可计算性。

Conclusion: 为开发更多样化和代表性的生成模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce "representative generation," extending the theoretical framework
for generation proposed by Kleinberg et al. (2024) and formalized by Li et al.
(2024), to additionally address diversity and bias concerns in generative
models. Our notion requires outputs of a generative model to proportionally
represent groups of interest from the training data. We characterize
representative uniform and non-uniform generation, introducing the "group
closure dimension" as a key combinatorial quantity. For representative
generation in the limit, we analyze both information-theoretic and
computational aspects, demonstrating feasibility for countably infinite
hypothesis classes and collections of groups under certain conditions, but
proving a negative result for computability using only membership queries. This
contrasts with Kleinberg et al.'s (2024) positive results for standard
generation in the limit. Our findings provide a rigorous foundation for
developing more diverse and representative generative models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分步方法，通过内容选择和多样性优先的策略，提升大语言模型在多文档摘要任务中的源覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时存在注意力不均的问题，导致在多文档摘要任务中源覆盖率不足。

Method: 将摘要任务分为三步：提取关键点、使用DPP选择多样性内容、重写为最终摘要。

Result: 在DiverseSumm基准测试中，该方法显著提高了源覆盖率，并能生成个性化摘要。

Conclusion: 分步结合提示和原则性技术，能有效提升多文档摘要的源覆盖率和个性化能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of handling
longer contexts, recent work has demonstrated that they exhibit the "lost in
the middle" phenomenon (Liu et al., 2024) of unevenly attending to different
parts of the provided context. This hinders their ability to cover diverse
source material in multi-document summarization, as noted in the DiverseSumm
benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). In this work, we contend that principled
content selection is a simple way to increase source coverage on this task. As
opposed to prompting an LLM to perform the summarization in a single step, we
explicitly divide the task into three steps -- (1) reducing document
collections to atomic key points, (2) using determinantal point processes (DPP)
to perform select key points that prioritize diverse content, and (3) rewriting
to the final summary. By combining prompting steps, for extraction and
rewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently
improve source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs.
Finally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent
into the DPP kernel, we can generate personalized summaries that cover relevant
source information while retaining coverage.

TL;DR: 论文研究了检索增强生成（RAG）对大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型任务中的影响，发现RAG可能因检索不完美或模型利用能力有限导致性能下降。通过实验评估了11种LLMs的检索鲁棒性，发现尽管它们表现出较高的鲁棒性，但仍存在不同程度的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG在实际应用中的鲁棒性，明确其在性能提升和潜在问题上的表现。

Method: 建立了包含1500个开放领域问题的基准数据集，引入三种鲁棒性指标，评估11种LLMs和3种提示策略。

Result: 实验显示所有LLMs均表现出较高的检索鲁棒性，但仍存在不同程度的缺陷，影响RAG的完全利用。

Conclusion: RAG并非总是优于非RAG，检索文档数量和顺序对结果有影响，LLMs的鲁棒性仍需改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) generally enhances large language
models' (LLMs) ability to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. But RAG may also
lead to performance degradation due to imperfect retrieval and the model's
limited ability to leverage retrieved content. In this work, we evaluate the
robustness of LLMs in practical RAG setups (henceforth retrieval robustness).
We focus on three research questions: (1) whether RAG is always better than
non-RAG; (2) whether more retrieved documents always lead to better
performance; (3) and whether document orders impact results. To facilitate this
study, we establish a benchmark of 1500 open-domain questions, each with
retrieved documents from Wikipedia. We introduce three robustness metrics, each
corresponds to one research question. Our comprehensive experiments, involving
11 LLMs and 3 prompting strategies, reveal that all of these LLMs exhibit
surprisingly high retrieval robustness; nonetheless, different degrees of
imperfect robustness hinders them from fully utilizing the benefits of RAG.

TL;DR: EFIM是一种改进的提示格式，通过优化KV缓存重用提升LLM在填充任务中的性能，同时引入片段标记化训练方法解决子词生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充任务中，KV缓存重用常因提示格式的结构问题而受限，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 提出EFIM提示格式以优化KV缓存重用，并引入片段标记化训练方法解决子词生成问题。

Result: 实验表明，EFIM能降低延迟52%，提升吞吐量98%，同时保持原有填充能力。

Conclusion: EFIM显著提升了LLM在填充任务中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which
involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These
tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce
the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV)
cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has
become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in
infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the
prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the
insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is
frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally
generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format
of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the
transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation
problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words
accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method
which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data
processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with
EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while
maintaining the original infilling capability.EFIM's source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统在复杂任务中资源消耗高且效率低下，需要一种资源感知的协作机制来优化性能。

Method: 提出Co-Saving系统，利用历史成功轨迹中的“捷径”跳过冗余推理，提高协作效率。

Result: 实验显示，相比ChatDev，Co-Saving平均减少50.85%的token使用，代码质量提升10.06%。

Conclusion: Co-Saving通过资源感知和“捷径”机制，显著提升了多智能体系统的效率和任务质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However,
standalone agents frequently encounter limitations when handling complex tasks
that demand extensive interactions and substantial computational resources.
Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) alleviate some of these limitations through
collaborative mechanisms like task decomposition, iterative communication, and
role specialization, they typically remain resource-unaware, incurring
significant inefficiencies due to high token consumption and excessive
execution time. To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware
multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively
engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge
to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality. Our key innovation is
the introduction of "shortcuts" -- instructional transitions learned from
historically successful trajectories -- which allows to bypass redundant
reasoning agents and expedite the collective problem-solving process.
Experiments for software development tasks demonstrate significant advantages
over existing methods. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art MAS
ChatDev, our method achieves an average reduction of 50.85% in token usage, and
improves the overall code quality by 10.06%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注知识图谱的结构方面，限制了其在更具挑战性的外部任务（如KGQA）中的应用。MERRY旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出多视角条件消息传递（CMP）编码架构，动态残差融合模块和灵活的边评分机制，以整合文本和结构信息。

Result: 在28个数据集上的评估显示，MERRY在大多数场景中优于现有基线，表现出强大的推理能力和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MERRY通过多模态整合，显著提升了知识图谱内外任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), the successful
application of foundation models across diverse tasks has demonstrated their
remarkable potential. However, despite the rich structural and textual
information embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing research of foundation
model for KG has primarily focused on their structural aspects, with most
efforts restricted to in-KG tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, KGC). This
limitation has hindered progress in addressing more challenging out-of-KG
tasks. In this paper, we introduce MERRY, a foundation model for general
knowledge graph reasoning, and investigate its performance across two task
categories: in-KG reasoning tasks (e.g., KGC) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., KG
question answering, KGQA). We not only utilize the structural information, but
also the textual information in KGs. Specifically, we propose a
multi-perspective Conditional Message Passing (CMP) encoding architecture to
bridge the gap between textual and structural modalities, enabling their
seamless integration. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic residual fusion
module to selectively retain relevant textual information and a flexible edge
scoring mechanism to adapt to diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on 28 datasets demonstrate that MERRY outperforms existing
baselines in most scenarios, showcasing strong reasoning capabilities within
KGs and excellent generalization to out-of-KG tasks such as KGQA.

TL;DR: RedTeamCUA是一个对抗性测试框架，用于评估计算机使用代理（CUAs）在混合Web-OS攻击场景中的漏洞，发现当前CUAs存在显著的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏对混合Web-OS攻击场景的支持，无法在受控环境中进行真实测试。

Method: 提出RedTeamCUA框架，结合VM和Docker的混合沙盒，支持灵活的对抗性场景配置和直接注入点测试。

Result: 测试显示CUAs存在高攻击成功率（ASR），如Claude 3.7 Sonnet的ASR为42.9%，Claude 4 Opus为48%。

Conclusion: RedTeamCUA为系统分析CUA漏洞提供了重要工具，强调了在部署前加强防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating
systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection.
Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled
environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both
interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing
framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS
environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features
tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration,
and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational
limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an
adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack
scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current
frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA
demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated,
still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute
adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to
complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe
concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the
recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%,
demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even
advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA
provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and
systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱和基于提示的方法难以捕捉习语翻译中的复杂文化关系，导致翻译效果不佳。

Method: 采用自适应图神经网络（GNN）方法IdiomCE，学习习语表达之间的复杂映射，并泛化到训练中未见过的节点。

Result: 在多个习语翻译数据集上评估，使用无参考指标，显著提升了英语到多种印度语言的习语翻译质量。

Conclusion: IdiomCE方法在资源受限环境下也能提升翻译质量，为小模型中的习语翻译提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Translating multi-word expressions (MWEs) and idioms requires a deep
understanding of the cultural nuances of both the source and target languages.
This challenge is further amplified by the one-to-many nature of idiomatic
translations, where a single source idiom can have multiple target-language
equivalents depending on cultural references and contextual variations.
Traditional static knowledge graphs (KGs) and prompt-based approaches struggle
to capture these complex relationships, often leading to suboptimal
translations. To address this, we propose IdiomCE, an adaptive graph neural
network (GNN) based methodology that learns intricate mappings between
idiomatic expressions, effectively generalizing to both seen and unseen nodes
during training. Our proposed method enhances translation quality even in
resource-constrained settings, facilitating improved idiomatic translation in
smaller models. We evaluate our approach on multiple idiomatic translation
datasets using reference-less metrics, demonstrating significant improvements
in translating idioms from English to various Indian languages.

Result: 在多个多跳问答基准测试中，RISE显著提高了推理准确性和任务性能。

Conclusion: RISE通过迭代自我探索有效提升模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，为多跳问答任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many areas but continue to face
challenges with complex reasoning tasks, such as Multi-Hop Question Answering
(MHQA). MHQA requires integrating evidence from diverse sources while managing
intricate logical dependencies, often leads to errors in reasoning.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely employed in MHQA tasks, faces
challenges in effectively filtering noisy data and retrieving all necessary
evidence, thereby limiting its effectiveness in addressing MHQA challenges. To
address these challenges, we propose RISE:Reasoning Enhancement via Iterative
Self-Exploration, a novel framework designed to enhance models' reasoning
capability through iterative self-exploration. Specifically, RISE involves
three key steps in addressing MHQA tasks: question decomposition,
retrieve-then-read, and self-critique. By leveraging continuous
self-exploration, RISE identifies accurate reasoning paths, iteratively
self-improving the model's capability to integrate evidence, maintain logical
consistency, and enhance performance in MHQA tasks. Extensive experiments on
multiple MHQA benchmarks demonstrate that RISE significantly improves reasoning
accuracy and task performance.

Method: 使用基于困惑度和基于奖励的验证器，在两个多语言基准（Aya Evaluation Suite和m-ArenaHard）上评估重复采样的效果。

Result: 结果显示质量持续提升，某些情况下提升超过35%。基于困惑度的评分对开放式提示有效，而基于奖励的验证器在需要推理的任务（如数学、代码）中表现更好。

We evaluate this approach using perplexity- and reward-based verifiers on two
multilingual benchmarks: the Aya Evaluation Suite and m-ArenaHard. Our results
show consistent quality improvements, with gains exceeding 35% in some cases.
While perplexity-based scoring is effective for open-ended prompts, only

for multilingual text generation and underscore the importance of selecting
right verifiers for the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域特定指令微调中，数据选择方法常忽视知识冲突问题，导致模型性能下降或产生幻觉。

Method: KDS框架通过两个知识感知指标（上下文-记忆知识对齐和内部记忆知识一致性）量化知识冲突，筛选高质量数据。

Result: 实验证明KDS在医学领域显著提升模型性能，改善泛化能力并减少幻觉问题。

Conclusion: KDS是一种简单有效的数据选择方法，适用于领域特定指令微调，显著提升模型表现。

Abstract: Domain-specific instruction-tuning has become the defacto standard for
improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized
applications, e.g., medical question answering. Since the instruction-tuning
dataset might contain redundant or low-quality data, data selection (DS) is
usually required to maximize the data efficiency. Despite the successes in the
general domain, current DS methods often struggle to select the desired data
for domain-specific instruction-tuning. One of the main reasons is that they
neglect the impact of knowledge conflicts, i.e., the discrepancy between LLMs'
pretrained knowledge and context knowledge of instruction data, which could
damage LLMs' prior abilities and lead to hallucination. To this end, we propose
a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Data Selection (namely KDS) framework to
select the domain-specific instruction-tuning data that meets LLMs' actual
needs. The core of KDS is to leverage two knowledge-aware metrics for
quantitatively measuring knowledge conflicts from two aspects: context-memory
knowledge alignment and intra-memory knowledge consistency. By filtering the
data with large knowledge conflicts and sampling the high-quality and diverse
data, KDS can effectively stimulate the LLMs' abilities and achieve better
domain-specific performance. Taking the medical domain as the testbed, we
conduct extensive experiments and empirically prove that KDS surpasses the
other baselines and brings significant and consistent performance gains among
all LLMs. More encouragingly, KDS effectively improves the model generalization
and alleviates the hallucination problem.

Conclusion: LaMDAgent为后训练管道自动化提供了高效解决方案，数据规模扩展有助于降低成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or
applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of
these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated
construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area.
Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on
optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies.
In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing
Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full
post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent
systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and
hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover
high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show
that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving
instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective
post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven
exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to
reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings
introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective
pipeline discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为{\delta}-Unlearning的黑盒大语言模型（LLM）遗忘框架，通过对比小模型的logit偏移来实现敏感数据的遗忘，解决了现有技术无法适用于黑盒模型或违反数据保护原则的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在训练过程中可能记忆敏感信息（如版权、偏见或隐私内容），引发伦理和法律问题。现有遗忘技术要么需要访问模型内部权重（不适用于黑盒模型），要么在推理时保留敏感数据（违反数据保护原则）。

Method: 提出{\delta}-Unlearning框架，通过对比一对小模型的logit偏移来学习遗忘所需的logit偏移，而非直接调整黑盒LLM。

Result: 实验表明，{\delta}-Unlearning能有效遗忘目标数据，同时在非遗忘任务上保持或提升性能。该框架还能兼容多种现有遗忘算法。

Conclusion: {\delta}-Unlearning为黑盒LLM提供了一种通用且高效的遗忘解决方案，解决了敏感数据记忆问题。

Abstract: Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire
knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive
information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has
led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning
has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training
data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to
black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate
data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time
correction. We propose {\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for
black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\delta}-Unlearning
learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a
pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\delta}- Unlearning can
effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger
performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\delta}-Unlearning also
effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a
versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to
black-box LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的安全漏洞，提出了一种两阶段评估框架来评估对抗攻击，并定义了理想模型行为的规范性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LVLMs在对抗攻击下的安全漏洞，揭示传统攻击如何绕过其安全机制。

Method: 提出两阶段评估框架：第一阶段区分指令不遵守、直接拒绝和成功攻击；第二阶段量化模型输出满足有害意图的程度，并分类拒绝行为。

Result: 揭示了LVLMs在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，并提出了评估和分类攻击效果的方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种规范性框架，为多模态系统的安全对齐提供了目标。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, their integration of visual
inputs introduces expanded attack surfaces, thereby exposing them to novel
security vulnerabilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic
representational analysis to uncover why conventional adversarial attacks can
circumvent the safety mechanisms embedded in LVLMs. We further propose a novel
two stage evaluation framework for adversarial attacks on LVLMs. The first
stage differentiates among instruction non compliance, outright refusal, and
successful adversarial exploitation. The second stage quantifies the degree to
which the model's output fulfills the harmful intent of the adversarial prompt,
while categorizing refusal behavior into direct refusals, soft refusals, and
partial refusals that remain inadvertently helpful. Finally, we introduce a
normative schema that defines idealized model behavior when confronted with
harmful prompts, offering a principled target for safety alignment in
multimodal systems.

Abstract: Mainstream large vision-language models (LVLMs) inherently encode cultural
biases, highlighting the need for diverse multimodal datasets. To address this
gap, we introduce Pearl, a large-scale Arabic multimodal dataset and benchmark
explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced
agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators
from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning
ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further
provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a
specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural
variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary
LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially
improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods.
Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed
multimodal modeling research. All datasets and benchmarks are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合方法研究中定量与定性数据对齐的挑战，探索LLMs在预测人类调查响应中的潜力。

Method: 利用LLMs（如Claude、GPT）基于访谈数据生成BREQ问卷的合成响应，分析其与人类响应的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs能捕捉总体响应模式但变异性较低；访谈内容和提示设计显著影响对齐，人口统计信息影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力桥接定性与定量方法，但需优化提示设计、减少偏见并提升响应变异性以增强数据有效性。

Abstract: Mixed methods research integrates quantitative and qualitative data but faces
challenges in aligning their distinct structures, particularly in examining
measurement characteristics and individual response patterns. Advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions by generating synthetic survey
responses informed by qualitative data. This study investigates whether LLMs,
guided by personal interviews, can reliably predict human survey responses,
using the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) and
interviews from after-school program staff as a case study. Results indicate
that LLMs capture overall response patterns but exhibit lower variability than
humans. Incorporating interview data improves response diversity for some
models (e.g., Claude, GPT), while well-crafted prompts and low-temperature
settings enhance alignment between LLM and human responses. Demographic
information had less impact than interview content on alignment accuracy. These
findings underscore the potential of interview-informed LLMs to bridge
qualitative and quantitative methodologies while revealing limitations in
response variability, emotional interpretation, and psychometric fidelity.
Future research should refine prompt design, explore bias mitigation, and
optimize model settings to enhance the validity of LLM-generated survey data in
social science research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）跨语言一致性的框架，揭示了其在多语言能力上的显著不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估LLM的多语言性能需要昂贵的数据集，且难以处理开放式生成任务。因此，作者提出了一种更简单的方法来评估模型响应的可预测性。

Method: 采用“翻译后评估”策略，从信息和共情两个维度评估LLM的跨语言一致性。

Result: 研究发现，流行的LLM在三十种语言中存在明显的不一致性，某些语系和文字的性能严重不足。

Conclusion: 跨语言评估需考虑多维度一致性，作者邀请业界使用其框架进行未来多语言LLM的基准测试。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide detailed and impressive responses to
queries in English. However, are they really consistent at responding to the
same query in other languages? The popular way of evaluating for multilingual
performance of LLMs requires expensive-to-collect annotated datasets. Further,
evaluating for tasks like open-ended generation, where multiple correct answers
may exist, is nontrivial. Instead, we propose to evaluate the predictability of
model response across different languages. In this work, we propose a framework
to evaluate LLM's cross-lingual consistency based on a simple Translate then
Evaluate strategy. We instantiate this evaluation framework along two
dimensions of consistency: information and empathy. Our results reveal
pronounced inconsistencies in popular LLM responses across thirty languages,
with severe performance deficits in certain language families and scripts,
underscoring critical weaknesses in their multilingual capabilities. These
findings necessitate cross-lingual evaluations that are consistent along
multiple dimensions. We invite practitioners to use our framework for future
multilingual LLM benchmarking.

citizens struggle to leverage their legal rights due to limited awareness and
access to relevant legal information. This paper introduces Legal Assist AI, a
transformer-based model designed to bridge this gap by offering effective legal
assistance through large language models (LLMs). The system retrieves relevant
legal information from a curated database and generates accurate responses,
enabling effective assistance for diverse users, including legal professionals,
scholars, and the general public. The model was fine-tuned on extensive
datasets from the Indian legal domain, including Indian Constitution, Bharatiya
Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and so forth,
providing a robust understanding of the complexities of Indian law. By
incorporating domain-specific legal datasets, the proposed model demonstrated
remarkable efficiency and specialization in legal Question-Answering. The model
was evaluated against state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral
7B, achieving a 60.08% score on the AIBE, outperforming its competitors in
legal reasoning and accuracy. Unlike other models, Legal Assist AI avoided
common issues such as hallucinations, making it highly reliable for practical
legal applications. It showcases the model's applicability in real-world legal
scenarios, with future iterations aiming to enhance performance and expand its
dataset to cover a broader range of multilingual and case-specific queries as
well.

Motivation: 推理优化的LLM在简单问题上过度思考，导致输出冗长且效率低。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出CoThink流程：指令模型生成高层解决方案大纲，推理模型完成具体推理。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，CoThink减少22.3%的token生成，准确率损失仅0.42%。

Conclusion: CoThink能动态调整推理深度，提升效率，并可能揭示LLM的推理效率缩放规律。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) benefit from increased test-time compute, a
phenomenon known as test-time scaling. However, reasoning-optimized models
often overthink even simple problems, producing excessively verbose outputs and
leading to low token efficiency. By comparing these models with equally sized
instruct models, we identify two key causes of this verbosity: (1)
reinforcement learning reduces the information density of forward reasoning,
and (2) backward chain-of thought training encourages redundant and often
unnecessary verification steps. Since LLMs cannot assess the difficulty of a
given problem, they tend to apply the same cautious reasoning strategy across
all tasks, resulting in inefficient overthinking. To address this, we propose
CoThink, an embarrassingly simple pipeline: an instruct model first drafts a
high-level solution outline; a reasoning model then works out the solution. We
observe that CoThink enables dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth based on
input difficulty. Evaluated with three reasoning models DAPO, DeepSeek-R1, and
QwQ on three datasets GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, CoThink reduces total token
generation by 22.3% while maintaining pass@1 accuracy within a 0.42% margin on
average. With reference to the instruct model, we formally define reasoning
efficiency and observe a potential reasoning efficiency scaling law in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据打包方法在持续预训练中容易导致截断和上下文不连续，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SP策略，分两阶段：1）滑动窗口同步重叠标记；2）使用First-Fit-Decreasing算法打包短文本以减少填充和截断。

Result: 在多种模型架构和语料领域上，SP方法在99%的情况下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SP策略有效提升了持续预训练的性能和效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual pre-training has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing
model performance, particularly in domain-specific scenarios. The most common
approach for packing data before continual pre-training involves concatenating
input texts and splitting them into fixed-length sequences. While
straightforward and efficient, this method often leads to excessive truncation
and context discontinuity, which can hinder model performance. To address these
issues, we explore the potential of data engineering to enhance continual
pre-training, particularly its impact on model performance and efficiency. We
propose Seamless Packing (SP), a novel data packing strategy aimed at
preserving contextual information more effectively and enhancing model
performance. Our approach employs a sliding window technique in the first stage
that synchronizes overlapping tokens across consecutive sequences, ensuring
better continuity and contextual coherence. In the second stage, we adopt a
First-Fit-Decreasing algorithm to pack shorter texts into bins slightly larger
than the target sequence length, thereby minimizing padding and truncation.
Empirical evaluations across various model architectures and corpus domains
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming baseline method in
99% of all settings. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本方法无法处理视觉信息，而现有视觉RAG方法因固定流程和推理能力不足而受限。强化学习被证明有助于模型推理，因此提出VRAG-RL框架。

Method: VRAG-RL通过视觉感知令牌和动作空间（如裁剪和缩放）优化模型与搜索引擎的交互，并结合查询重写和检索性能设计奖励机制。

Result: VRAG-RL在多模态RAG任务中表现出色，解决了推理令牌分配不足和检索信息不相关的问题。

Conclusion: VRAG-RL通过强化学习策略优化视觉语言模型，提升了视觉丰富信息检索和推理的实际应用性能。

Abstract: Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information
remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot
handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG
approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to
reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental
capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model
reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex
reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact
with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning
trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual
optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of
RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely
incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token
allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models
interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant
information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to
suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space
tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling,
allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective.
Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the
retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query
rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL
optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning
the model with real-world applications. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该基准在13种不同的评估模型中表现优异，显著优于现有基准，同时保持高分离性和多样性。

Conclusion: JBDistill为安全评估提供了一种高效、可持续且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in critical applications,
raising urgent needs for robust safety benchmarking. We propose Jailbreak
Distillation (JBDistill), a novel benchmark construction framework that
"distills" jailbreak attacks into high-quality and easily-updatable safety
benchmarks. JBDistill utilizes a small set of development models and existing
jailbreak attack algorithms to create a candidate prompt pool, then employs
prompt selection algorithms to identify an effective subset of prompts as
safety benchmarks. JBDistill addresses challenges in existing safety
evaluation: the use of consistent evaluation prompts across models ensures fair
comparisons and reproducibility. It requires minimal human effort to rerun the
JBDistill pipeline and produce updated benchmarks, alleviating concerns on
saturation and contamination. Extensive experiments demonstrate our benchmarks
generalize robustly to 13 diverse evaluation models held out from benchmark
construction, including proprietary, specialized, and newer-generation LLMs,
significantly outperforming existing safety benchmarks in effectiveness while
maintaining high separability and diversity. Our framework thus provides an
effective, sustainable, and adaptable solution for streamlining safety
evaluation.

Result: 实验证明Mirabel能有效检测和防御多种先进MIA方法，并适配现有私有RAG系统。

Conclusion: Mirabel框架成功平衡隐私保护与数据实用性，为RAG系统提供安全解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates the hallucination problem in
large language models (LLMs) and has proven effective for specific,
personalized applications. However, passing private retrieved documents
directly to LLMs introduces vulnerability to membership inference attacks
(MIAs), which try to determine whether the target datum exists in the private
external database or not. Based on the insight that MIA queries typically
exhibit high similarity to only one target document, we introduce Mirabel, a
similarity-based MIA detection framework designed for the RAG system. With the
proposed Mirabel, we show that simple detect-and-hide strategies can
successfully obfuscate attackers, maintain data utility, and remain
system-agnostic. We experimentally prove its detection and defense against
various state-of-the-art MIA methods and its adaptability to existing private
RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，基于强化学习的LLMs在数学任务中仅优化推理路径而非推理能力，而监督微调（SFT）可以提升推理能力。本文从科学信息提取（SciIE）任务出发，探讨如何通过SFT和RLVR共同提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：1. MimicSFT，使用结构化推理模板，无需高质量链式思维数据；2. R²GRPO，结合相关性和规则诱导的奖励。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法均能提升推理能力，R²GRPO结合MimicSFT在关系提取任务中优于基线LLMs和专用监督模型。

Conclusion: 通过SFT和RLVR的结合，可以有效提升LLMs在SciIE任务中的推理能力，R²GRPO与MimicSFT的组合表现最佳。

Abstract: Previous study suggest that powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) trained
with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) only refines
reasoning path without improving the reasoning capacity in math tasks while
supervised-finetuning(SFT) with distillation can. We study this from the view
of Scientific information extraction (SciIE) where LLMs and reasoning LLMs
underperforms small Bert-based models. SciIE require both the reasoning and
memorization. We argue that both SFT and RLVR can refine the reasoning path and
improve reasoning capacity in a simple way based on SciIE. We propose two-stage
training with 1. MimicSFT, using structured reasoning templates without needing
high-quality chain-of-thought data, 2. R$^2$GRPO with relevance and
rule-induced rewards. Experiments on scientific IE benchmarks show that both
methods can improve the reasoning capacity. R$^2$GRPO with mimicSFT surpasses
baseline LLMs and specialized supervised models in relation extraction. Our

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions has
significantly enhanced their ability to tackle unseen tasks. However, despite
their strong generalization capabilities, instruction-following LLMs encounter
difficulties when dealing with tasks that require domain knowledge. This work
introduces a specialized instruction fine-tuning for the domain of
computational argumentation (CA). The goal is to enable an LLM to effectively
tackle any unseen CA tasks while preserving its generalization capabilities.
Reviewing existing CA research, we crafted natural language instructions for
105 CA tasks to this end. On this basis, we developed a CA-specific benchmark
for LLMs that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in
solving various CA tasks. We synthesized 52k CA-related instructions, adapting
the self-instruct process to train a CA-specialized instruction-following LLM.
Our experiments suggest that CA-specialized instruction fine-tuning
significantly enhances the LLM on both seen and unseen CA tasks. At the same
time, performance on the general NLP tasks of the SuperNI benchmark remains
stable.

TL;DR: R1-Router是一个动态检索框架，通过结合推理状态决定何时从不同知识库检索信息，显著减少幻觉并提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法采用静态检索流程，忽视了多模态大语言模型的推理和规划能力，无法动态决定与知识库的交互方式。

Method: 提出R1-Router框架，动态生成后续查询并路由到合适的知识库，结合Step-GRPO强化学习算法优化推理行为。

Result: 在多个开放域QA基准测试中，R1-Router性能优于基线模型7%以上，并能高效利用多样知识库。

Conclusion: R1-Router通过动态检索和强化学习，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has shown promise in
mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge during generation. Existing MRAG methods
typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information
from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However,
these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to
dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning
process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG
framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on
the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up
queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate
queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a
coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we
introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored
reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize
the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA
benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms
baseline models by over 7%. Further analysis shows that R1-Router can
adaptively and effectively leverage diverse KBs, reducing unnecessary
retrievals and improving both efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识库的Text-to-SQL方法，通过构建全面的知识库解决现有LLMs在生成SQL时因参数知识有限而导致的准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的Text-to-SQL方法在处理多样化和领域特定的查询时，由于参数知识有限，生成的SQL准确性不足。

Method: 构建一个综合知识库，结合所有可用问题、相关数据库模式及其相关知识，为查询检索和生成必要知识。

Result: 在多个Text-to-SQL数据集上验证，该方法在重叠和非重叠数据库场景中均显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 通过知识库的构建和利用，显著提升了Text-to-SQL的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL aims to translate natural language queries into SQL statements,
which is practical as it enables anyone to easily retrieve the desired
information from databases. Recently, many existing approaches tackle this
problem with Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their strong capability
in understanding user queries and generating corresponding SQL code. Yet, the
parametric knowledge in LLMs might be limited to covering all the diverse and
domain-specific queries that require grounding in various database schemas,
which makes generated SQLs less accurate oftentimes. To tackle this, we propose
constructing the knowledge base for text-to-SQL, a foundational source of
knowledge, from which we retrieve and generate the necessary knowledge for
given queries. In particular, unlike existing approaches that either manually
annotate knowledge or generate only a few pieces of knowledge for each query,
our knowledge base is comprehensive, which is constructed based on a
combination of all the available questions and their associated database
schemas along with their relevant knowledge, and can be reused for unseen
databases from different datasets and domains. We validate our approach on
multiple text-to-SQL datasets, considering both the overlapping and
non-overlapping database scenarios, where it outperforms relevant baselines
substantially.

TL;DR: MemOS是一个为大型语言模型（LLM）设计的内存操作系统，首次将内存提升为一类操作资源，解决了当前LLM在内存管理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏统一和结构化的内存架构，主要依赖参数化内存和短暂的激活内存，限制了长期知识演化的能力。

Method: MemOS引入了MemCube作为标准化内存抽象，支持异构内存的跟踪、融合和迁移，并提供了结构化的访问机制。

Result: MemOS建立了一个以内存为中心的执行框架，具有强可控性、适应性和可演化性。

Conclusion: MemOS填补了当前LLM基础设施的关键空白，为下一代智能系统的持续适应、个性化智能和跨平台协调奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational infrastructure in
the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite their remarkable
capabilities in language perception and generation, current LLMs fundamentally
lack a unified and structured architecture for handling memory. They primarily
rely on parametric memory (knowledge encoded in model weights) and ephemeral
activation memory (context-limited runtime states). While emerging methods like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporate plaintext memory, they lack
lifecycle management and multi-modal integration, limiting their capacity for
long-term knowledge evolution. To address this, we introduce MemOS, a memory
operating system designed for LLMs that, for the first time, elevates memory to
a first-class operational resource. It builds unified mechanisms for
representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types:
parametric, activation, and plaintext. At its core is the MemCube, a
standardized memory abstraction that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of
heterogeneous memory, while offering structured, traceable access across tasks
and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework with
strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. It fills a critical gap
in current LLM infrastructure and lays the groundwork for continual adaptation,
personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in next-generation
intelligent systems.

<details>

Motivation: 传统注意力机制在长上下文建模中存在计算冗余问题，所有token消耗相同的计算资源，而实际上只有少数token对预测有显著贡献。

Method: 将概率序列建模重新定义为监督学习任务，分析注意力稀疏性，并提出基于分组编码策略的动态分组注意力（DGA）方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，DGA显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了竞争性能。

Conclusion: DGA通过减少冗余注意力计算，有效提升了长上下文建模的效率，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language
processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational
inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while
attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal}
computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional
probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task},
enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a
clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we
theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens
significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate
attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group
coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness
against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we
propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group
coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens
during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优于传统大语言模型（LLMs），但过度思考问题严重影响了其计算效率，尤其是在简单任务中生成冗余推理链，浪费资源。

Method: 引入Think-Bench基准和新效率指标，全面评估LRMs在推理过程、结果质量和链式思维（CoT）特性等多维度的表现。

Result: 多数LRMs在处理简单问题时表现出过度思考，生成冗长推理链；部分模型CoT质量高但效率低。

Conclusion: Think-Bench为LRMs研究提供了坚实基础，未来可推动LRMs效率优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex
tasks, often outperforming conventional large language models (LLMs). However,
the prevalent issue of overthinking severely limits their computational
efficiency. Overthinking occurs when models generate excessive and redundant
tokens that contribute little to accurate outcomes, especially in simple tasks,
resulting in a significant waste of computational resources. To systematically
investigate this issue, we introduce Think-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate the reasoning efficiency of LRMs. We also propose novel efficiency
metrics and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various LRMs across multiple
dimensions, including the reasoning process, outcome quality, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) characteristics. Our analysis reveals that most LRMs
exhibit overthinking in handling easy questions, generating unnecessarily
lengthy reasoning chains. While many LRMs demonstrate high CoT quality, several
suffer from low efficiency. We hope that Think-Bench can serve as a robust
foundation for advancing research into LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中低血压（IOH）与不良预后相关，但预测困难，主要由于事件稀疏性和静态与动态数据整合的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）基于扩散方法增强的生理时间序列进行领域自适应预训练；2）在原始临床数据集上进行任务微调。通过标记级对齐实现多模态融合。

Result: 在两个术中数据集上的实验表明，IOHFuseLM在识别IOH事件方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IOHFuseLM在临床决策支持中具有应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia
and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and
increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by
event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across
diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal
language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse
hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage
involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented
through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns
associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the
original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish
normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each
patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding
physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model
to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding
clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into
structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on
two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established
baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability
in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to
promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过改进负样本选择和重排序策略来提升多语言和跨语言事实核查的性能，并验证了跨语言检索的独特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言环境中，尤其是资源有限的语言或全球性事件中，跨语言检索事实核查信息至关重要。

Method: 采用负样本选择（监督学习）和重排序（无监督学习）策略，并在47种语言的数据集上进行评估。

Result: 最佳结果来自基于LLM的重排序，其次是基于句子相似性的负样本微调。

Conclusion: 跨语言检索具有独特特性，与多语言检索不同。

Abstract: Retrieval of previously fact-checked claims is a well-established task, whose
automation can assist professional fact-checkers in the initial steps of
information verification. Previous works have mostly tackled the task
monolingually, i.e., having both the input and the retrieved claims in the same
language. However, especially for languages with a limited availability of
fact-checks and in case of global narratives, such as pandemics, wars, or
international politics, it is crucial to be able to retrieve claims across
languages. In this work, we examine strategies to improve the multilingual and
crosslingual performance, namely selection of negative examples (in the
supervised) and re-ranking (in the unsupervised setting). We evaluate all
approaches on a dataset containing posts and claims in 47 languages (283
language combinations). We observe that the best results are obtained by using
LLM-based re-ranking, followed by fine-tuning with negative examples sampled
using a sentence similarity-based strategy. Most importantly, we show that
crosslinguality is a setup with its own unique characteristics compared to the
multilingual setup.

Motivation: 当前PEFT方法在微调LLM时可能牺牲通用能力，导致灾难性遗忘（CF）。LoKI旨在通过机制性理解知识存储方式，解决这一问题。

Method: LoKI基于对Transformer架构中知识存储的机制性理解，提出了一种低损伤知识植入技术。

Result: 在两种实际场景中，LoKI的任务性能与全微调或LoRA方法相当甚至更优，同时显著保留了通用能力。

Conclusion: LoKI通过结合机制性洞察与实用微调目标，实现了任务专业化和通用能力保留的最佳平衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning adapts pretrained models for specific tasks but poses the risk of
catastrophic forgetting (CF), where critical knowledge from pre-training is
overwritten. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Large
Language Models (LLMs), while efficient, often sacrifice general capabilities.
To address the issue of CF in a general-purpose PEFT framework, we propose
\textbf{Lo}w-damage \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}mplanting (\textbf{LoKI}), a
PEFT technique that is based on a mechanistic understanding of how knowledge is
stored in transformer architectures. In two real-world scenarios, LoKI
demonstrates task-specific performance that is comparable to or even surpasses
that of full fine-tuning and LoRA-based methods across various model types,
while significantly better preserving general capabilities. Our work connects
mechanistic insights into LLM knowledge storage with practical fine-tuning
objectives, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between task specialization
and the preservation of general capabilities. Our implementation is publicly
available as ready-to-use code\footnote{https://github.com/Nexround/LoKI}.

Conclusion: EULER有效提升了LLMs的数学推理能力，生成的错误解决方案有助于训练和推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
and achieved promising results in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Learning
from errors offers the potential to further enhance the performance of LLMs
during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, the errors in synthesized
solutions are typically gathered from sampling trails, making it challenging to
generate solution errors for each mathematical problem. This paper introduces
the Error-IndUced LEaRning (EULER) model, which aims to develop an error
exposure model that generates high-quality solution errors to enhance the
mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, EULER optimizes the
error exposure model to increase the generation probability of self-made
solution errors while utilizing solutions produced by a superior LLM to
regularize the generation quality. Our experiments across various mathematical
problem datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the EULER model, achieving an
improvement of over 4% compared to all baseline models. Further analysis
reveals that EULER is capable of synthesizing more challenging and educational
solution errors, which facilitate both the training and inference processes of
LLMs. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/EULER.

Method: 使用自推测解码诊断冗余层，选择性替换为SSM组件，并进行针对性自蒸馏。

Result: 在数学和编码任务上显著超越基线模型，收敛速度提升2倍，性能优于大模型蒸馏结果。

Conclusion: RAD为混合模型的高效优化和性能提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Hybrid models combining Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) are
promising for balancing performance and efficiency. However, optimizing these
hybrid models, particularly by addressing the potential redundancy inherent
within the Transformer components, remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose RAD (Redundancy-Aware Distillation), a novel framework that
uses self-speculative decoding as a diagnostic tool to identify redundant
attention layers within the model. These identified layers are then selectively
replaced with SSM components, followed by targeted (self-)distillation.
Specifically, RAD focuses knowledge transfer on the components identified as
redundant, considering architectural changes and specific weight initialization
strategies. We experimentally demonstrate that self-distillation using RAD
significantly surpasses the performance of the original base model on
mathematical and coding tasks. Furthermore, RAD is also effective in standard
knowledge distillation settings, achieving up to approximately 2x faster
convergence compared to baseline methods. Notably, while a baseline model
distilled from a Llama-3.1 70B teacher achieves scores of 46.17 on GSM8K and
22.75 on CRUX, RAD achieves significantly higher scores of 71.27 on GSM8K and
28.25 on CRUX, even when using a much smaller Llama-3.1 8B teacher. RAD offers
a new pathway for efficient optimization and performance enhancement in the
distillation of hybrid models.

Result: 模型依赖词汇捷径，泛化能力差，但在任务特定预训练和联合训练下表现提升。

Conclusion: 任务特定预训练和联合训练能显著提升模型在论证识别任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Identifying arguments is a necessary prerequisite for various tasks in
automated discourse analysis, particularly within contexts such as political
debates, online discussions, and scientific reasoning. In addition to
theoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a
significant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining,
supported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these
benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best,
reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse
contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of
such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to
generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three
standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better
generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the
task. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on
lexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may
often be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment. While
the models achieve strong results on familiar benchmarks, their performance
drops markedly when applied to unseen datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating both
task-specific pre-training and joint benchmark training proves effective in
enhancing both robustness and generalization.

Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法在复杂场景下表现不佳，尤其是需要深层语义理解而非简单知识复述时。利用LLM的上下文推理能力，ICL成为一种有潜力的编辑方法，但受限于上下文窗口。

Method: 提出InComeS框架，通过将编辑上下文压缩为特殊gist token的KV缓存，并添加跨注意力模块动态选择信息，提升编辑效率。

Result: 在多种编辑格式的基准测试中，InComeS表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: InComeS通过压缩和动态选择机制，显著提升了LLM处理多编辑任务的能力，解决了上下文窗口的限制问题。

Abstract: Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit
facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic
understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong
contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context
learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit
information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by
the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and
efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we
propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process
editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms.
Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV)
cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits
without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore,
specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most
relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective
utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model
editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Abstract: Recent work shows that post-training datasets for LLMs can be substantially
downsampled without noticeably deteriorating performance. However, data
selection often incurs high computational costs or is limited to narrow
domains. In this paper, we demonstrate that data selection can be both --
efficient and universal -- by using a multi-step pipeline in which we
efficiently bin data points into groups, estimate quality using specialized
models, and score difficulty with a robust, lightweight method. Task-based
categorization allows us to control the composition of our final data --
crucial for finetuning multi-purpose models. To guarantee diversity, we improve
upon previous work using embedding models and a clustering algorithm. This
integrated strategy enables high-performance fine-tuning with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: NeoDiff为文本生成提供了一个更有效和理论统一的框架，展示了扩散模型在高质量文本生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation,
with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous
diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption
independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion
progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion
models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the
diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture
semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous
C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models
(NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both
discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion
process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising
paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively
modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff
utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise
control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete
and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective
framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation
tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of
non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based
methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight
NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and
advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.

Result: 发现即使是GPT-4o和Claude-3.7-Sonnet等顶级模型也存在显著的提示敏感性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于不同模型、任务和指标，为LLM评估提供了稳健且有意义的方法。

Abstract: LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, yet standard benchmarks
typically report performance using a single prompt, raising concerns about the
reliability of such evaluations. In this work, we argue for a stochastic method
of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt
perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that
accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for
estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful
results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and
find that even top-performing models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit
substantial prompt sensitivity. Our approach is model-, task-, and
metric-agnostic, offering a recipe for meaningful and robust LLM evaluation.

*Xiang Huang,Ting-En Lin,Feiteng Fang,Yuchuan Wu,Hangyu Li,Yuzhong Qu,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为反向偏好优化（RPO）的方法，用于解决大型语言模型在处理多约束复杂指令时的噪声问题，通过动态反转指令中的约束来优化偏好对，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理多约束复杂指令时，现有方法基于约束满足数量选择偏好对会引入噪声，导致选中的响应可能不完美，而拒绝的响应在某些方面可能优于选中的响应。

Method: 提出反向偏好优化（RPO），通过动态反转指令中的约束，确保选中响应完美，减少噪声，并扩大选中与拒绝响应间的差距。

Result: 在Sysbench和Multi-IF基准测试中，RPO平均比DPO基线分别提升4.6和2.5分（基于Llama-3.1 8B），且70B参数的RPO模型超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: RPO是一种简单有效的方法，能显著提升多约束指令跟随任务的性能，并具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Instruction following (IF) is a critical capability for large language models
(LLMs). However, handling complex instructions with multiple constraints
remains challenging. Previous methods typically select preference pairs based
on the number of constraints they satisfy, introducing noise where chosen
examples may fail to follow some constraints and rejected examples may excel in
certain respects over the chosen ones. To address the challenge of aligning
with multiple preferences, we propose a simple yet effective method called
Reverse Preference Optimization (RPO). It mitigates noise in preference pairs
by dynamically reversing the constraints within the instruction to ensure the
chosen response is perfect, alleviating the burden of extensive sampling and
filtering to collect perfect responses. Besides, reversal also enlarges the gap
between chosen and rejected responses, thereby clarifying the optimization
direction and making it more robust to noise. We evaluate RPO on two multi-turn
IF benchmarks, Sysbench and Multi-IF, demonstrating average improvements over
the DPO baseline of 4.6 and 2.5 points (on Llama-3.1 8B), respectively.
Moreover, RPO scales effectively across model sizes (8B to 70B parameters),
with the 70B RPO model surpassing GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TabXEval的表格评估框架，结合结构对齐和语义-句法比较，解决了传统方法在表格评估中的不足，并通过TabXBench验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格评估指标难以捕捉结构和内容的细微差异，因此需要一种更全面、可解释的评估方法。

Method: 提出TabXEval框架，包含TabAlign（结构对齐）和TabCompare（语义-句法比较）两阶段，并使用TabXBench进行验证。

Result: TabXEval在多样化的表格任务和领域中表现出色，优于传统方法，并通过敏感性-特异性分析验证其有效性。

Conclusion: TabXEval为可解释的表格评估提供了新思路，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Evaluating tables qualitatively & quantitatively presents a significant
challenge, as traditional metrics often fail to capture nuanced structural and
content discrepancies. To address this, we introduce a novel, methodical rubric
integrating multi-level structural descriptors with fine-grained contextual
quantification, thereby establishing a robust foundation for comprehensive
table comparison. Building on this foundation, we propose TabXEval, an
eXhaustive and eXplainable two-phase evaluation framework. TabXEval initially
aligns reference tables structurally via TabAlign & subsequently conducts a
systematic semantic and syntactic comparison using TabCompare; this approach
clarifies the evaluation process and pinpoints subtle discrepancies overlooked
by conventional methods. The efficacy of this framework is assessed using
TabXBench, a novel, diverse, multi-domain benchmark we developed, featuring
realistic table perturbations and human-annotated assessments. Finally, a
systematic analysis of existing evaluation methods through
sensitivity-specificity trade-offs demonstrates the qualitative and
quantitative effectiveness of TabXEval across diverse table-related tasks and
domains, paving the way for future innovations in explainable table evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何结合推测解码和量化技术来加速大语言模型的内存受限推理，提出了一种分层框架以优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码和量化技术分别通过验证多个令牌和压缩权重来加速推理，但直接结合时4位量化模型的性能优势会被推测解码的计算负载抵消。

Method: 提出分层框架，使用小模型作为中间阶段将树状草案转为序列草案，以利用量化模型的内存访问优势。

Result: 实验显示，分层方法在4位权重量化的Llama-3-70B模型上实现了2.78倍加速，优于EAGLE-2的1.31倍。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效结合了推测解码和量化的优势，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Speculative decoding and quantization effectively accelerate memory-bound
inference of large language models. Speculative decoding mitigates the memory
bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass,
which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization
by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces
computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their
strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques.
Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method
EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit
weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative
decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more
time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized
models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical
framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn
tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits
of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical
approach achieves a 2.78$\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit
weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\times$.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C²TU的无训练、无提示方法，用于揭示中文社交媒体中的伪装毒性内容，通过子串匹配和语义过滤实现高效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中伪装毒性内容（如同音字替换）的增多给内容审核带来挑战，现有方法主要针对英文，中文领域尚未解决。

Method: C²TU通过子串匹配识别候选毒性词，结合BERT和LLMs进行过滤和纠正。LLMs部分解决了自回归限制，利用完整语义上下文。

Result: 在两个中文毒性数据集上，C²TU的F1分数和准确率分别比最佳竞争对手高71%和35%。

Conclusion: C²TU为中文伪装毒性内容识别提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Social media platforms have experienced a significant rise in toxic content,
including abusive language and discriminatory remarks, presenting growing
challenges for content moderation. Some users evade censorship by deliberately
disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of
unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English
texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To
tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free
method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling. It first employs substring
matching to identify candidate toxic words based on Chinese homo-graph and
toxic lexicon. Then it filters those candidates that are non-toxic and corrects
cloaks to be their corresponding toxicities. Specifically, we develop two model
variants for filtering, which are based on BERT and LLMs, respectively. For
LLMs, we address the auto-regressive limitation in computing word occurrence
probability and utilize the full semantic contexts of a text sequence to reveal
cloaked toxic words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^2$TU can achieve
superior performance on two Chinese toxic datasets. In particular, our method
outperforms the best competitor by up to 71% on the F1 score and 35% on
accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了预训练语言模型（LMs）能否从基于token的生成过渡到基于句子或概念的抽象推理，并提出了一种框架，通过预测连续句子嵌入实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类推理基于高级抽象（如句子和概念），而LMs目前仅基于token生成，研究旨在探索LMs是否能在语义单元上进行抽象推理。

Method: 提出一种框架，将预训练的token级LMs适配到句子空间，通过自回归预测连续句子嵌入。研究了两种嵌入范式：语义嵌入（通过自编码保留表面意义）和上下文嵌入（通过下一句预测编码预期结构）。

Result: 在数学、逻辑、常识和规划四个领域中，上下文嵌入在连续推理下表现与Chain-of-Thought（CoT）相当，同时平均减少50%的推理计算量。

Conclusion: 研究表明，预训练LMs可以在潜在嵌入空间中有效进行抽象和结构化推理，并展示了可扩展性和模块化适应性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human
reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions,
and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn
to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In
this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such
abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We
present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in
sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next
sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical
representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to
preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via
next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both
under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted
embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely
in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics,
logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous
inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while
reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs
of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent
trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes
intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results
indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured
reasoning within latent embedding spaces.

Method: JQL通过预训练多语言嵌入的轻量级标注器，系统化筛选高质量多语言数据。

Result: 在35种语言上验证，JQL显著优于现有方法（如Fineweb2），提升下游模型训练质量和数据保留率。

Conclusion: JQL为多语言数据筛选提供实用方案，提升了多语言数据集开发标准。

Abstract: High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively
pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable
open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art
datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their
cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a
systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality
multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands.
JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on
pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual
and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during
training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation
pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like
Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases
data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable
resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual
dataset development.

TL;DR: 研究分析了文本转语音（TTS）系统对句法边界的敏感性，发现系统在句法模糊的句子中难以准确生成语调短语边界，而在简单句法结构中表现较好。通过微调模型，系统能更好地利用语言学线索生成更准确的语调模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TTS系统如何利用句法信息生成语调短语边界，尤其是在句法模糊的情况下，以提升其自然度和准确性。

Method: 采用心理语言学启发的方法，分析TTS系统在生成语调短语边界时的表现，并针对句法模糊句子进行模型微调。

Result: TTS系统在句法模糊的句子中依赖表面标记（如逗号）生成边界，而在简单句法结构中能利用更深层次的句法线索。微调后模型能生成更符合底层结构的语调模式。

Conclusion: TTS系统在句法模糊的情况下表现不足，但通过微调可以提升其对语言学线索的敏感性，从而生成更自然的语调模式。

Abstract: We analyze the syntactic sensitivity of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems using
methods inspired by psycholinguistic research. Specifically, we focus on the
generation of intonational phrase boundaries, which can often be predicted by
identifying syntactic boundaries within a sentence. We find that TTS systems
struggle to accurately generate intonational phrase boundaries in sentences
where syntactic boundaries are ambiguous (e.g., garden path sentences or
sentences with attachment ambiguity). In these cases, systems need superficial
cues such as commas to place boundaries at the correct positions. In contrast,
for sentences with simpler syntactic structures, we find that systems do
incorporate syntactic cues beyond surface markers. Finally, we finetune models
on sentences without commas at the syntactic boundary positions, encouraging
them to focus on more subtle linguistic cues. Our findings indicate that this
leads to more distinct intonation patterns that better reflect the underlying
structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法评估生物医学领域中的多跳推理能力，特别是涉及一对多和多对多关系的查询。

Method: 基于PrimeKG构建BioHopR，包含1跳和2跳推理任务，反映真实生物医学复杂性。

Result: O3-mini在1跳任务中表现最佳（37.93%精度），但所有模型在多跳任务中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: BioHopR为生物医学多跳推理评估设定了新标准，揭示了专有与开源模型之间的差距，并推动未来研究。

Abstract: Biomedical reasoning often requires traversing interconnected relationships
across entities such as drugs, diseases, and proteins. Despite the increasing
prominence of large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks lack the
ability to evaluate multi-hop reasoning in the biomedical domain, particularly
for queries involving one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This gap
leaves the critical challenges of biomedical multi-hop reasoning underexplored.
To address this, we introduce BioHopR, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
multi-hop, multi-answer reasoning in structured biomedical knowledge graphs.
Built from the comprehensive PrimeKG, BioHopR includes 1-hop and 2-hop
reasoning tasks that reflect real-world biomedical complexities.
  Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal that O3-mini, a proprietary
reasoning-focused model, achieves 37.93% precision on 1-hop tasks and 14.57% on
2-hop tasks, outperforming proprietary models such as GPT4O and open-source
biomedical models including HuatuoGPT-o1-70B and Llama-3.3-70B. However, all
models exhibit significant declines in multi-hop performance, underscoring the
challenges of resolving implicit reasoning steps in the biomedical domain. By
addressing the lack of benchmarks for multi-hop reasoning in biomedical domain,
BioHopR sets a new standard for evaluating reasoning capabilities and
highlights critical gaps between proprietary and open-source models while
paving the way for future advancements in biomedical LLMs.

Python code generation with LLMs to interact with the table and get the answer

content of the table, generating natural language instructions in the form of
steps to follow in order to get the answer, translating these instructions to
code, running it and handling potential errors or exceptions. These steps use
open source LLMs and fine grained optimized prompts for each task (step). With
this approach, we achieved a score of $70.50\%$ for subtask 1.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
multilingual machine translation, sometimes even outperforming traditional
neural systems. However, previous research has highlighted the challenges of
using LLMs, particularly with prompt engineering, for low-resource languages.
In this work, we introduce Fragment-Shot Prompting, a novel in-context learning
method that segments input and retrieves translation examples based on
syntactic coverage, along with Pivoted Fragment-Shot, an extension that enables
translation without direct parallel data. We evaluate these methods using
GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, o1-mini, LLaMA-3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for translation between
Italian and two Ladin variants, revealing three key findings: (1) Fragment-Shot
Prompting is effective for translating into and between the studied
low-resource languages, with syntactic coverage positively correlating with
translation quality; (2) Models with stronger reasoning abilities make more
effective use of retrieved knowledge, generally produce better translations,
and enable Pivoted Fragment-Shot to significantly improve translation quality
between the Ladin variants; and (3) prompt engineering offers limited, if any,
improvements when translating from a low-resource to a high-resource language,
where zero-shot prompting already yields satisfactory results. We publicly
release our code and the retrieval corpora.

Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法依赖实体定位且易过度编辑，导致对无明确实体的对抗输入无效或拒绝合法查询。

Method: 提出ToxEdit，动态检测前向传播中的毒性激活模式，并通过自适应层间路径计算缓解毒性。

Result: 实验表明，ToxEdit在去毒性能和保持LLM通用能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToxEdit通过动态毒性检测和自适应路径设计，实现了精确去毒且不损害模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but
remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing
knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges.
First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective
against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods
suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries,
compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a
toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic
activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations
through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This
design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general
capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the
SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks.
Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and
safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.

familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their
parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce
CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas,
explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual
(hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11
LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation,
with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through
counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method
enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts)
before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps
from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy
(+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to
human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting
information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for
understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world
applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of
their factual knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）模型的方法，通过引入正交性损失和方差损失，提升专家专业化能力，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的辅助负载均衡损失导致专家重叠和路由过于均匀，限制了专家专业化并降低性能。

Method: 提出两种互补目标：正交性损失（鼓励专家处理不同类型标记）和方差损失（鼓励更具区分性的路由决策）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升专家专业化，性能提升高达23.79%，同时保持下游任务的负载均衡。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需架构修改或额外组件，显著优化了MoE模型的训练和性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we
observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to
expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization
and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we
propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary
objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct
types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative
routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives
are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing
the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and
across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert
specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with
auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in
downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional
components. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法（监督微调+强化学习）来提升多模态语言模型的推理能力，显著优于单一方法，并在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态语言模型（MLLMs）中自修正推理模式的存在及其与强化学习的关系，探索如何通过结合监督微调和强化学习提升推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 监督微调（SFT）作为冷启动，引入结构化思维链推理模式；2) 使用GRPO强化学习进一步优化。

Result: 两阶段方法在3B和7B规模的MLLMs上均显著优于单一方法，7B模型在MathVista和We-Math上分别提升7.1%和7.5%，3B模型性能接近部分7B模型。

Conclusion: 结合监督微调和强化学习是提升多模态推理能力的有效方法，为构建先进模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning
(RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment"
patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often
attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these
patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not
necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these
insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning
through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start
with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2)
reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our
extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms
both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing
substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on
MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving
performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides
practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Grad通过将自由形式的文本反馈转化为细粒度的梯度信号，优化语言模型策略，显著提升了任务性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF使用粗粒度的标量奖励，掩盖了成功或失败的细节原因，导致学习缓慢且不透明。Text2Grad旨在通过细粒度的文本反馈改进这一问题。

Method: Text2Grad包含三个组件：反馈标注管道、细粒度奖励模型和基于梯度的策略优化器，将文本反馈转化为针对特定token跨度的梯度更新。

Result: 在摘要、代码生成和问答任务中，Text2Grad的表现优于传统标量奖励RL和仅基于提示的方法，任务指标和可解释性均显著提升。

Conclusion: 将自然语言反馈转化为梯度信号是一种强大的细粒度策略优化方法，Text2Grad为此提供了有效实现。

Abstract: Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that
mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and
opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through
prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model
parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm
that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human
(or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the
relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward
signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending
portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned
adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three
components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs
critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts
span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a
span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients.
Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad
consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing
both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate
that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful
signal for fine-grained policy optimization. The code for our method is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs如何处理虚假预设，并探讨了某些语言因素是否影响其对虚假预设内容的反应。研究发现LLMs难以识别虚假预设，且表现因条件而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假预设可能嵌入争议或虚假信息，引发对LLMs是否能像人类一样检测和纠正误导性假设的担忧。

Method: 采用基于语言预设分析的系统方法，研究LLMs在不同条件下对虚假预设的敏感度。实验使用新数据集测试了GPT-4-o、LLama-3-8B和Mistral-7B-v03三种模型。

Result: 模型普遍难以识别虚假预设，表现因语言构造、政治党派和情境概率等因素而异。

Conclusion: 语言预设分析是揭示LLMs中政治错误信息强化现象的有力工具。

Abstract: This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain
linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content.
Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly
effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns
about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading
assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of
misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic
presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are
more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on
political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction,
political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false
presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and
examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's
Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false
presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights
that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the
reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有推理优化大型语言模型的高计算成本和推理延迟问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：第一阶段通过迭代蒸馏和强化学习优化模型；第二阶段引入双系统框架，支持快速和慢速推理模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pangu Embedded表现优于同类模型，提供快速响应和先进的推理质量。

Conclusion: Pangu Embedded展示了开发强大且实用的大型语言模型推理器的潜力。

Abstract: This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible
fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant
computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing
reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its
construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation
process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate
complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend
clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale
synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided
by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic,
task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM
evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2
introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode
for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This
framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic,
complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates
computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental
results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate
that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like
Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art
reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a
promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM
reasoners.

TL;DR: RAG-Zeval是一个新型端到端框架，通过规则引导的推理任务评估RAG系统的忠实性和正确性，减少计算成本并提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的评估框架依赖复杂的多阶段提示，计算成本高且未充分利用模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习训练评估器，引入基于排名的奖励机制，并通过零人工标注生成质量控制的响应。

Result: RAG-Zeval在人类判断相关性上表现最佳，优于参数多10-100倍的基线模型，且具有更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: RAG-Zeval提供了一种高效、可解释的RAG系统评估方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Robust evaluation is critical for deploying trustworthy retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems. However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks
predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex
multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and
introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval
(RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness
and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains
evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate
comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We
introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments
rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise
pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by
generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments
demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest
correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs
with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior
interpretability in response evaluation.

TL;DR: MM-UPT是一种基于GRPO的无监督后训练框架，通过自奖励机制提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法（如SFT和RL）依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，且无监督方法复杂难迭代。MM-UPT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MM-UPT利用GRPO算法，通过多数投票自奖励机制替代传统奖励信号，实现无监督后训练。

Result: 实验表明，MM-UPT显著提升了Qwen2.5-VL-7B的推理能力（如MathVista从66.3%到72.9%），并优于其他无监督基线。

Conclusion: MM-UPT为无外部监督下持续增强MLLMs提供了新范式，合成问题进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training
stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement
learning (RL). However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually
annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent
efforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and
difficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of
GRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual
self-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple
yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds
upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism
based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments
demonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of
Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9
%$\rightarrow$68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth
labels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even
approaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that
incorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost
performance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable
self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual,
autonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision. Our
code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of agentic information seeking capabilities through the integration
of tools such as search engines and web browsers. However, current mainstream
approaches for enabling LLM web search proficiency face significant challenges:
supervised fine-tuning struggles with data production in open-search domains,
while RL converges quickly, limiting their data utilization efficiency. To
address these issues, we propose EvolveSearch, a novel iterative self-evolution
framework that combines SFT and RL to enhance agentic web search capabilities
without any external human-annotated reasoning data. Extensive experiments on
seven multi-hop question-answering (MHQA) benchmarks demonstrate that
EvolveSearch consistently improves performance across iterations, ultimately
achieving an average improvement of 4.7\% over the current state-of-the-art
across seven benchmarks, opening the door to self-evolution agentic
capabilities in open web search domains.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标注数据或昂贵的GPT模型调用，不适用于低资源场景。本文旨在通过知识蒸馏和两阶段微调策略，以更少的标注数据实现高性能。

Method: 1. 使用多个教师MLLMs生成标签预测和解释作为知识；2. 设计两阶段知识蒸馏框架：第一阶段对所有训练数据进行LoRA微调，第二阶段对教师预测冲突的数据点结合LoRA和DPO进一步微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需不到10%的标注数据即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段知识蒸馏框架显著降低了标注成本，同时提升了小型MLLMs在检测上下文外新闻中的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context news is a type of misinformation in which the image
is used outside of its original context. Many existing works have leveraged
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting out-of-context news.
However, observing the limited zero-shot performance of smaller MLLMs, they
generally require label-rich fine-tuning and/or expensive API calls to GPT
models to improve the performance, which is impractical in low-resource
scenarios. In contrast, we aim to improve the performance of small MLLMs in a
more label-efficient and cost-effective manner. To this end, we first prompt
multiple teacher MLLMs to generate both label predictions and corresponding
rationales, which collectively serve as the teachers' knowledge. We then
introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation framework to transfer this
knowledge to a student MLLM. In Stage 1, we apply LoRA fine-tuning to the
student model using all training data. In Stage 2, we further fine-tune the
student model using both LoRA fine-tuning and DPO on the data points where
teachers' predictions conflict. This two-stage strategy reduces annotation
costs and helps the student model uncover subtle patterns in more challenging
cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance using less than 10% labeled data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务自适应的推理框架DeepSeek-R1，通过可变长度推理链和复合奖励函数，显著提升了情感理解任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖固定长度的CoT推理，无法适应情感复杂性的变化，因此需要一种更灵活的自适应推理方法。

Method: 结合微调与强化学习，设计复合奖励函数，平衡预测准确性、推理深度控制、路径多样性和逻辑重复抑制。

Result: 在情感、情绪、幽默和讽刺四项任务中，Acc和F1分数均有提升，高级任务的峰值提升尤为显著。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应深度分析，弥合了固定CoT推理与情感复杂性之间的差距。

Abstract: Emotion understanding includes basic tasks (e.g., sentiment/emotion
classification) and advanced tasks (e.g., sarcasm/humor detection). Current
methods rely on fixed-length CoT reasoning, failing to adapt to the varying
complexity of emotions. We propose a task-adaptive reasoning framework that
employs DeepSeek-R1 to generate variable-length reasoning chains for different
emotion tasks. By combining fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, we design
a composite reward function that balances four objectives: prediction accuracy,
adaptive reasoning depth control, structural diversity in reasoning paths, and
suppression of repetitive logic. This approach achieves dynamic
context-sensitive inference while enabling LLMs to autonomously develop deep
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate consistent
improvements in both Acc and F1 scores across four tasks: emotion, sentiment,
humor, and sarcasm. Notably, peak enhancements reached 3.56% F1 (2.76% Acc) for
basic tasks and 37.95% F1 (23.14% Acc) for advanced tasks. Our work bridges
rigid CoT reasoning and emotional complexity through adaptive-depth analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声明验证方法主要依赖非结构化文本，难以有效利用知识图谱的结构化知识，而大型语言模型在未适应的情况下难以进行多步推理。

Method: ClaimPKG通过轻量级专用LLM将输入声明表示为伪子图，引导子图检索模块找到相关KG子图，再由通用LLM生成最终结论和解释。

Result: 在FactKG数据集上，ClaimPKG性能优于基线9%-12%，并在HoVer和FEVEROUS等非结构化数据集上展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ClaimPKG成功结合了知识图谱的结构化知识与LLM的推理能力，为声明验证领域提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim
verification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations
well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on
unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs.
Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs
struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without
adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end
framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge
from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight,
specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a
dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These
retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the
final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset
demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across
multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability
to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining
structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain
converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and
important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns
observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper
alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study
focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models,
systematically investigating how hierarchical representations in LLMs align
with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By
comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI
data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative
story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to precisely
identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region
activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the
evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies,
particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at
higher semantic abstraction levels.

generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM)
agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental
controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of
RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g.,
multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG
systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits
the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study,
we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified
retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and
interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent
framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the
inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an
end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset
to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and
larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and
dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fusion Steering是一种激活引导方法，通过动态注入提示特定的激活增量提升LLMs在QA任务中的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法局限于单层或固定层操作，无法灵活适应不同提示的需求。

Method: 采用动态注入提示特定的激活增量，优化注入权重以平衡事实对齐和流畅性。

Result: 在260个SimpleQA提示上，分段引导的准确率达到25.4%，显著优于基线（3.5%）和全层引导（16.2%）。

Conclusion: 分段动态干预策略和全网络激活控制具有潜力，为LLMs的可解释和可扩展控制提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present Fusion Steering, an activation steering methodology that improves
factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA)
tasks. This approach introduces flexible steering configurations, including
full-layer steering and segmented steering. Unlike traditional methods
constrained to single-layer or fixed-layer operations, Fusion Steering employs
dynamic injection of prompt-specific activation deltas across all transformer
layers. These activation deltas are derived from reference completions that
combine the ground-truth answer with a model-generated explanation to
facilitate semantically enriched, example-specific steering. The injection
weights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that
balances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy).
Evaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded
quality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Empirical
results on 260 SimpleQA prompts (selected from 500 where the baseline failed)
showcase the efficacy of segmented steering. Using Gemma-2-2B-IT with 8-bit
quantization, segmented steering achieves an accuracy of 25.4% (outputs scoring
$\geq 0.6$), outperforming the baseline at 3.5% and full-layer steering at
16.2%. Under the stricter SimpleQA rubric, segmented steering boosts fully
correct responses from 0.0% to 13.1%. These findings highlight the strengths of
segmented, dynamic intervention strategies and the promise of per-prompt,
full-network activation control. Fusion Steering is also amenable to sparse
representations, such as Neuronpedia or sparse crosscoders, suggesting a
promising direction for interpretable and scalable activation-level control in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LayerMoE的算法，通过分析LLM不同层的语言特性，动态分配新专家以扩展新语言，同时减少对旧语言性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建强大的多语言LLM需要不断扩展新语言，但现有方法参数成本高且难以避免对旧语言性能的影响。

Method: 提出LayerMoE算法，基于语言相似性动态分配专家，并在高相似性层添加分类器以引导路由。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单次扩展和持续扩展场景中分别减少了60%和33.3%的专家数量，性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LayerMoE通过动态专家分配和路由优化，有效降低了扩展成本并减轻了对旧语言的遗忘。

Abstract: Continually expanding new languages for existing large language models (LLMs)
is a promising yet challenging approach to building powerful multilingual LLMs.
The biggest challenge is to make the model continuously learn new languages
while preserving the proficient ability of old languages. To achieve this,
recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new
languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old
languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old
experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when
expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old
languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language
characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert
allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new
experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit
different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the
similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the
higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the
forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network
on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language
tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion
setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PISCES是一种新型框架，通过直接编辑参数空间中的方向，精确地从大语言模型中擦除特定概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在预训练中可能获取敏感或受版权保护的知识，现有方法（如微调或事实级编辑）效果有限。

Method: PISCES使用解缠模型分解MLP向量为可解释特征，通过自动解释技术识别目标概念相关特征，并从参数中移除。

Result: 在Gemma 2和Llama 3.1上的实验显示，PISCES将目标概念准确率降至7.7%，擦除特异性提升31%，鲁棒性提升38%。

Conclusion: 基于特征的参数内编辑为语言模型中的概念知识移除提供了更精确可靠的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often acquire knowledge during pretraining that
is undesirable in downstream deployments, e.g., sensitive information or
copyrighted content. Existing approaches for removing such knowledge rely on
fine-tuning, training low-rank adapters or fact-level editing, but these are
either too coarse, too shallow, or ineffective. In this work, we propose PISCES
(Precise In-parameter Suppression for Concept EraSure), a novel framework for
precisely erasing entire concepts from model parameters by directly editing
directions that encode them in parameter space. PISCES uses a disentangler
model to decompose MLP vectors into interpretable features, identifies those
associated with a target concept using automated interpretability techniques,
and removes them from model parameters. Experiments on Gemma 2 and Llama 3.1
over various concepts show that PISCES achieves modest gains in efficacy over
leading erasure methods, reducing accuracy on the target concept to as low as
7.7%, while dramatically improving erasure specificity (by up to 31%) and
robustness (by up to 38%). Overall, these results demonstrate that
feature-based in-parameter editing enables a more precise and reliable approach
for removing conceptual knowledge in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多个领域表现优异，但在数学推理中仍存在许多错误案例。现有方法仅从孤立案例中学习，未能泛化错误模式。

Method: SEI框架通过分析GSM8K和MATH数据集中的错误案例，生成错误关键词并聚类错误类型，利用GPT-4o生成针对性训练数据，并通过单样本学习优化数据。

Result: 实验表明，SEI框架显著提升了模型在数学推理任务中的表现，包括领域内和领域外数据集。

Conclusion: SEI框架通过错误泛化和针对性训练数据生成，有效提升了语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various
domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning.
Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely
extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the
extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents
Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses
and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we
explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to
pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on
the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering
these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for
each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which
synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new
data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the
most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to
fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance
performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements
in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain
mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error
instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源Diffusion LLMs的推理速度落后于自回归模型，且并行解码时生成质量下降。

Method: 引入块级近似KV缓存机制和置信感知并行解码策略。

Result: 在多个LLM基准测试中，吞吐量提升高达27.6倍，且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 填补了Diffusion LLMs与自回归模型的性能差距，为其实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities.
However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often
lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and
quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism
tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with
negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of
generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token
dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we
propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes
tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and
maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models
across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$
throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap
with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of
Diffusion LLMs.

Motivation: 密集标注的图像标题有助于学习视觉-语言对齐，但如何系统优化人工标注效率尚未充分研究。

Method: CoTalk采用顺序标注减少冗余工作，结合多模态界面（阅读输入、语音输出）提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，CoTalk比并行方法标注速度更快（0.42 vs. 0.30单位/秒），检索性能更高（41.13% vs. 40.52%）。

Conclusion: CoTalk在固定预算下显著提升标注效率和实用性，为视觉-语言对齐任务提供更优数据支持。

Abstract: While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning
of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically
optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce
Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize
the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed
budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built
upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload
compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only
need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that
previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input
faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via
talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate
our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the
comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into
object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic
evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in
facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants
show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30
units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13\% vs. 40.52\%) over the parallel
method.

Conclusion: LLMs在形式化训练中表现出基于抽象的泛化能力，但其可靠性受上下文线索影响，表现为"随机变色龙"行为。

Abstract: The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has
been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots
that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often
erroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors
exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context
hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their
predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from
a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization,
in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the
query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability
experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation
types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal
computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower
layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii)
feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing
direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose
relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more
nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based
training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in
unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的空间感知能力存在明显不足，需要一种能够生成符合空间常识的合成数据的方法。

Method: 通过构建空间知识图谱（SKG）模拟人类对空间方向和距离的感知，并以此指导多模态数据合成。

Result: 实验表明，合成的数据显著提升了模型的空间感知和推理能力，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于知识的数据合成方法有望推动空间智能的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception
abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal
data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data
adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we
introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial
knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation.
SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate
human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is
subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge,
including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and
reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization
capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can
advance the development of spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注的链式思维数据训练LLMs，但这类数据获取成本高且难以覆盖所有任务。目标是让模型能够组合原子推理技能，解决未见组合任务。

Method: 提出改进原子任务的CoT数据格式使其可组合，并通过多任务学习或模型融合结合原子CoT模型，进一步使用拒绝采样微调（RFT）在小规模组合数据上优化。

Result: 实验表明，在字符串操作和自然语言技能组合任务上，使用可组合CoT训练的LLMs优于多任务学习和持续微调基线。

Conclusion: 改进CoT数据格式并组合原子模型能有效提升LLMs在组合任务上的零样本性能，为推理能力的泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: A common approach for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason is to
train on chain-of-thought (CoT) traces of in-distribution reasoning problems,
but such annotated data is costly to obtain for every problem of interest. We
want reasoning models to generalize beyond their training distribution, and
ideally to generalize compositionally: combine atomic reasoning skills to solve
harder, unseen reasoning tasks. We take a step towards compositional
generalization of reasoning skills when addressing a target compositional task
that has no labeled CoT data. We find that simply training models on CoT data
of atomic tasks leads to limited generalization, but minimally modifying CoT
formats of constituent atomic tasks to be composable can lead to improvements.
We can train "atomic CoT" models on the atomic tasks with Composable CoT data
and combine them with multitask learning or model merging for better zero-shot
performance on the target compositional task. Such a combined model can be
further bootstrapped on a small amount of compositional data using rejection
sampling fine-tuning (RFT). Results on string operations and natural language
skill compositions show that training LLMs on Composable CoT outperforms
multitask learning and continued fine-tuning baselines within a given training
data budget.

Motivation: 了解LLM在简体中文和繁体中文提示下的性能差异，以避免因文化背景不同导致的潜在危害。

Method: 设计了两项基准任务（区域术语选择和区域名称选择），并评估了11种商业和开源LLM的性能。

Result: 发现LLM在任务和提示语言上存在偏见：简体中文在术语选择中占优，而繁体中文在名称选择中更受青睐。

Conclusion: 训练数据、字符偏好和分词差异可能导致偏见，需进一步分析；提供了开源数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: While the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied in
both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, it is yet unclear whether LLMs exhibit
differential performance when prompted in these two variants of written
Chinese. This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM
responses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different
cultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can
exacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such
as education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,
we design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term
choice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to
differently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting
the LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and
Traditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading
commercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily
trained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses
indicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and
prompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified
Chinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored
Traditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these
disparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written
character preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
These findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,
we provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations
of future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants
(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).

browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised
fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for
enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on
the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information
seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of
WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our
training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable
insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable
agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in

Motivation: 探索奖励噪声对LLM后训练的影响，以更贴近实际场景的需求。

Method: 通过手动翻转奖励函数输出引入噪声，并设计推理模式奖励（RPR）来校准噪声奖励模型。

Result: 在40%奖励噪声下，Qwen-2.5-7B模型仍能快速收敛，性能从5%提升至72%；仅使用RPR时，模型性能超过70%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了预训练阶段提升模型基础能力的重要性，并为后训练技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning
through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be
accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast,
our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical
consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs
using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to
substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward
function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve
rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%,
compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless
rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning
phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need
to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak
downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models
trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing
the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR
with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models,
mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on
open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models'
foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights
for advancing post-training techniques. Our code and scripts are available at

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试缺乏适应性和细粒度评估能力，无法满足多样化应用领域的需求。

Method: GuessArena采用对抗性游戏交互（类似“猜猜我是谁”游戏），结合动态领域知识建模和渐进式推理评估。

Result: 在金融、医疗、制造、信息技术和教育五个领域的实证研究表明，GuessArena能有效区分LLMs的领域知识覆盖和推理链完整性。

Conclusion: GuessArena在可解释性、可扩展性和场景适应性方面优于传统基准测试。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on
static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined
test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2)
standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained
assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To
overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation
framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the
interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly
integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning
assessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five
vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology,
and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in
terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared
to conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in
interpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.

reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply
long or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length
dynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto
Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that
enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on
the complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm,
in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when
shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed
method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY>
token. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating
lengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs'
ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after
training. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of
reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM
reasoning.

### [103] [Understanding the learned look-ahead behavior of chess neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21552)
*Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了国际象棋神经网络的预见能力，特别是Leela Chess Zero策略网络，发现其预见行为高度依赖上下文，并能处理最多七步后的棋盘状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析神经网络在国际象棋任务中的预见能力，以理解AI在复杂领域中的推理机制。

Method: 基于Jenner等人的工作，分析模型对多步未来走法和替代序列的考虑能力。

Result: 网络能处理七步后的棋盘状态，并考虑多种可能的走法序列，而非单一线路。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络在战略任务中预见能力的涌现，为AI推理提供了新见解，并展示了可解释性技术的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks,
specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the
work of Jenner et al. (2024) by analyzing the model's ability to consider
future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our
findings reveal that the network's look-ahead behavior is highly
context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position.
We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to
seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different
future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers
multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play.
These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead
capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our
understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains. Our work also showcases the
effectiveness of interpretability techniques in uncovering cognitive-like
processes in artificial intelligence systems.

*Yongchao Chen,Yueying Liu,Junwei Zhou,Yilun Hao,Jingquan Wang,Yang Zhang,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R1-Code-Interpreter通过多轮监督微调和强化学习，使LLM在推理过程中自主生成代码查询，显著提升精确计算和符号推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在精确计算和符号推理任务中表现不足的问题，探索如何有效结合文本推理与代码生成。

Method: 采用多轮监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）训练Qwen-2.5模型，研究不同策略（如GRPO vs. PPO）和代码输出形式。

Result: R1-CI-14B模型在37个测试任务中平均准确率从44.0%提升至64.1%，接近GPT-4o（70.9%）。

Conclusion: SFT阶段对代码解释器训练至关重要，R1-Code-Interpreter在多样任务中表现出色，具备自检能力。

Abstract: Despite advances in reasoning and planning of R1-like models, Large Language
Models (LLMs) still struggle with tasks requiring precise computation, symbolic
manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic reasoning, in which textual
reasoning lacks the rigor of code execution. A key challenge is enabling LLMs
to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI
trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks
guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and
generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension
of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries
during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107
for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We
fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies,
investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models,
cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs.
Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training
is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code
execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model,
R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to
64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with
Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code
generation. Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at

Motivation: 解决在图上受限探索的序列决策问题，适用于接触追踪和机器人探索等场景。

Method: 设计了一种基于Gittins索引的策略，适用于一般图，在森林图中证明最优，实现复杂度为O(n²·|Σ|²)。

Result: 在合成和真实图上的实验中，该方法显著优于基线，例如在HIV测试中仅需检测一半人口即可发现几乎所有阳性病例。

Conclusion: 提出的策略在理论和实际中均表现优异，适用于受限探索场景。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem on a $n$-node graph $G$ where
each node has an unknown label from a finite set $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, drawn from
a joint distribution $P$ that is Markov with respect to $G$. At each step,
selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The
goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted
rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited
to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in
settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins
index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when
$G$ is a forest. Our implementation runs in $O(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^2)$
time while using $O(n \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^2)$ oracle calls to $P$ and
$O(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|)$ space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
graphs show that our method consistently outperforms natural baselines,
including in non-tree, budget-limited, and undiscounted settings. For example,
in HIV testing simulations on real-world sexual interaction networks, our
policy detects nearly all positive cases with only half the population tested,
substantially outperforming other baselines.

Abstract: In over sixty years since its inception, the field of planning has made
significant contributions to both the theory and practice of building planning
software that can solve a never-before-seen planning problem. This was done
through established practices of rigorous design and evaluation of planning
systems. It is our position that this rigor should be applied to the current
trend of work on planning with large language models. One way to do so is by
correctly incorporating the insights, tools, and data from the automated
planning community into the design and evaluation of LLM-based planners. The
experience and expertise of the planning community are not just important from
a historical perspective; the lessons learned could play a crucial role in
accelerating the development of LLM-based planners. This position is
particularly important in light of the abundance of recent works that replicate
and propagate the same pitfalls that the planning community has encountered and
learned from. We believe that avoiding such known pitfalls will contribute
greatly to the progress in building LLM-based planners and to planning in
general.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态优化框架，通过分割和优化推理路径中的思考模式，减少计算开销并提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在优化最终答案准确性的同时，可能因过度思考导致输出冗长和性能下降。作者假设这是由于LRMs无法动态选择适当的模块化推理策略。

Method: 提出动态优化框架，将推理路径分割为不同思考模式，系统识别并优化有益模式，同时移除有害模式。

Result: 优化后的推理路径更简洁且高效，减少注意力计算量达47%，同时保持准确性，并将部分错误答案转化为正确答案，提升15.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过偏好优化技术，该方法显著降低计算开销并提升推理准确性，在数学推理基准测试中实现12%的准确率提升，并将令牌使用量从约5,000减少到3,000。

Abstract: While recent success of large reasoning models (LRMs) significantly advanced
LLMs' reasoning capability by optimizing the final answer accuracy using
reinforcement learning, they may also drastically increase the output length
due to overthinking, characterized by unnecessarily complex reasoning paths
that waste computation and potentially degrade the performance. We hypothesize
that such inefficiencies stem from LRMs' limited capability to dynamically
select the proper modular reasoning strategies, termed thinking patterns at the
right position. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a dynamic
optimization framework that segments model-generated reasoning paths into
distinct thinking patterns, systematically identifying and promoting beneficial
patterns that improve the answer while removing detrimental ones. Empirical
analysis confirms that our optimized thinking paths yield more concise yet
sufficiently informative trajectories, enhancing reasoning efficiency by
reducing attention FLOPs by up to 47% while maintaining accuracy for originally
correct responses. Moreover, a non-trivial portion of originally incorrect
responses are transformed into correct ones, achieving a 15.6% accuracy
improvement with reduced length. Motivated by the improvement brought by the
optimized thinking paths, we apply a preference optimization technique
supported by a pairwise dataset contrasting suboptimal and optimal reasoning
paths. Experimental evaluations across multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks reveal that our method notably reduces computational overhead while
simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy, achieving up to a 12% accuracy
improvement and reducing token usage from approximately 5,000 to 3,000 tokens.

TL;DR: AIDSAFE提出了一种通过多代理迭代审议生成高质量安全推理数据的方法，显著提升了LLMs的安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全措施存在过度拒绝和越狱漏洞问题，安全推理范式需要高质量的政策嵌入思维链数据集。

Method: AIDSAFE利用多代理审议迭代扩展安全政策推理，并通过数据精炼阶段消除低质量输出。

Result: AIDSAFE生成的思维链数据在政策遵循和推理质量上表现优异，显著提升了LLMs的安全泛化能力。

Conclusion: AIDSAFE为LLMs的安全训练提供了高效的数据生成方法，同时保持了实用性和准确性。

Abstract: Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies
before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety
measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However,
implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process
of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while
ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy
conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation
for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent
deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner
stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive,
redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong
foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training.
Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such
as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief
augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our
evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy
adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning
open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization
and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal
accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能在用户提出天真问题时正确应用安全事实，以避免潜在危险。

Method: 引入SAGE-Eval基准，包含104个安全事实，生成10,428个测试场景，覆盖7个领域。

Result: 表现最佳的模型Claude-3.7-sonnet仅通过58%的安全事实测试，模型能力与训练计算量相关性弱。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs缺乏稳健的泛化能力，建议开发者使用SAGE-Eval评估模型可靠性。

Abstract: Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations?
Lacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance,
"I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other
foods would be good to include?" Before offering food options, the LLM should
warn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the
CDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even
death. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic
GEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly
apply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises
104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically
augmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g.,
Outdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet,
passes only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model
capabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on
SAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings
suggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend
developers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model
reliability in addressing salient risks. We publicly release SAGE-Eval at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval and our code is available

Conclusion: SVRPBench为可重复研究提供数据集和评估套件，推动设计能适应现实不确定性的求解器。

Abstract: Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most
benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first
open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing
at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it
simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal
delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for
residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse,
constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups.
Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade
by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic
methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset
and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that
generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: AI copilots, context-aware, AI-powered systems designed to assist users in
tasks such as software development and content creation, are becoming integral
to modern workflows. As these systems grow in capability and adoption,
personalization has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring usability, trust, and
productivity. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the
ability of AI copilots to detect, interpret, and align with individual user
preferences. While personalization techniques are well-established in domains
like recommender systems and dialogue agents, their adaptation to interactive,
real-time systems like AI copilots remains fragmented and underexplored. This
survey addresses this gap by synthesizing research on how user preferences are
captured, modeled, and refined within the design of AI copilots. We introduce a
unified definition of AI copilots and propose a phase-based taxonomy of
preference optimization strategies, structured around pre-interaction,
mid-interaction, and post-interaction stages. We analyze techniques for
acquiring preference signals, modeling user intent, and integrating feedback
loops, highlighting both established approaches and recent innovations. By
bridging insights from AI personalization, human-AI collaboration, and large
language model adaptation, this survey provides a structured foundation for
designing adaptive, preference-aware AI copilots. It offers a holistic view of
the available preference resources, how they can be leveraged, and which
technical approaches are most suited to each stage of system design.

Abstract: Since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts have largely
focused on improving their instruction-following and deductive reasoning
abilities, leaving open the question of whether these models can truly discover
new knowledge. In pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there is a
growing need for models that not only execute commands or retrieve information
but also learn, reason, and generate new knowledge by formulating novel
hypotheses and theories that deepen our understanding of the world. Guided by
Peirce's framework of abduction, deduction, and induction, this survey offers a
structured lens to examine LLM-based hypothesis discovery. We synthesize
existing work in hypothesis generation, application, and validation,
identifying both key achievements and critical gaps. By unifying these threads,
we illuminate how LLMs might evolve from mere ``information executors'' into
engines of genuine innovation, potentially transforming research, science, and
real-world problem solving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种功能性子图匹配方法，用于识别逻辑电路中隐含的功能性子图，克服了传统结构图同构方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构图同构，无法识别因合成变换导致拓扑变化的电路中的功能相关子图。

Method: 提出两阶段多模态框架：1）学习AIG和后映射网表中的功能嵌入；2）使用图分割方法识别模糊边界。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，功能性子图检测准确率达93.8%，模糊边界识别的Dice分数为91.3%。

Conclusion: 功能性子图匹配方法显著优于现有结构方法，适用于EDA应用。

Abstract: Subgraph matching in logic circuits is foundational for numerous Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) applications, including datapath optimization,
arithmetic verification, and hardware trojan detection. However, existing
techniques rely primarily on structural graph isomorphism and thus fail to
identify function-related subgraphs when synthesis transformations
substantially alter circuit topology. To overcome this critical limitation, we
introduce the concept of functional subgraph matching, a novel approach that
identifies whether a given logic function is implicitly present within a larger
circuit, irrespective of structural variations induced by synthesis or
technology mapping. Specifically, we propose a two-stage multi-modal framework:
(1) learning robust functional embeddings across AIG and post-mapping netlists
for functional subgraph detection, and (2) identifying fuzzy boundaries using a
graph segmentation approach. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (ITC99,
OpenABCD, ForgeEDA) demonstrate significant performance improvements over
existing structural methods, with average $93.8\%$ accuracy in functional
subgraph detection and a dice score of $91.3\%$ in fuzzy boundary
identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖计算成本高的端到端训练，要么缺乏持续学习能力，EHC旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，EHC性能优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EHC作为一种通用代理，能有效处理复杂多模态任务，且无需参数更新。

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating remarkable capabilities,
there has been a surge in research on leveraging LLMs to build general-purpose
multi-modal agents. However, existing approaches either rely on computationally
expensive end-to-end training using large-scale multi-modal data or adopt
tool-use methods that lack the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new
environments. In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of
learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory
Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL)
module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and
continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory
capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task
characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across
different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard
datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general
agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在静态感知任务中表现优异，但在交互环境中进行规划时，缺乏时间推理、空间理解和常识基础。

Method: 通过从闭源模型中提取高质量数据集进行监督微调（SFT），并设计基于规则的奖励函数，利用广义强化偏好优化（GRPO）优化策略。

Result: 在Embench基准测试中，该方法显著优于类似或更大规模的模型（如GPT-4o-mini和70B+开源基线），并展现出对未见环境的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，强化驱动的推理在具身AI的长时程规划中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based
on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent
vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle
with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding
needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement
into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful
closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model
with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward
function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via
Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is
evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks,
covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show
that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale,
including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong
generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of
reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.

Motivation: 当前辅助系统在实时导航中存在延迟与语义丰富性的矛盾，自然语言系统速度慢，而符号语言系统语义深度不足。

Method: VAG-EC框架利用知识图谱表示对象及其关系，结合注意力机制优先处理任务相关实体，生成紧凑、可解释且上下文敏感的符号语言。

Conclusion: VAG-EC展示了基于认知的符号语言在实时辅助技术中的潜力，提供快速、自适应且符合人类认知的解决方案。

Abstract: Assistive systems for visually impaired individuals must deliver rapid,
interpretable, and adaptive feedback to facilitate real-time navigation.
Current approaches face a trade-off between latency and semantic richness:
natural language-based systems provide detailed guidance but are too slow for
dynamic scenarios, while emergent communication frameworks offer low-latency
symbolic languages but lack semantic depth, limiting their utility in tactile
modalities like vibration. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
framework, Cognitively-Inspired Emergent Communication via Knowledge Graphs
(VAG-EC), which emulates human visual perception and cognitive mapping. Our
method constructs knowledge graphs to represent objects and their
relationships, incorporating attention mechanisms to prioritize task-relevant
entities, thereby mirroring human selective attention. This structured approach
enables the emergence of compact, interpretable, and context-sensitive symbolic
languages. Extensive experiments across varying vocabulary sizes and message
lengths demonstrate that VAG-EC outperforms traditional emergent communication

TL;DR: VIRAL是一个通过多模态大语言模型生成和优化奖励函数的流程，旨在解决AI中人与机器对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中奖励函数设计不当可能导致风险，而大语言模型在奖励生成上已超越人类表现。

Method: VIRAL利用多模态大语言模型自主生成奖励函数，并通过人类反馈或视频LLM生成的描述进行交互式优化。

Result: 在五个Gymnasium环境中测试，VIRAL加速了新行为的学习并提高了与用户意图的对齐。

Conclusion: VIRAL为奖励函数生成和优化提供了一种高效且对齐用户意图的方法。

Abstract: The alignment between humans and machines is a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence today. Reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize a
reward function, is particularly vulnerable to the risks associated with poorly
designed reward functions. Recent advancements has shown that Large Language
Models (LLMs) for reward generation can outperform human performance in this
context. We introduce VIRAL, a pipeline for generating and refining reward
functions through the use of multi-modal LLMs. VIRAL autonomously creates and
interactively improves reward functions based on a given environment and a goal
prompt or annotated image. The refinement process can incorporate human
feedback or be guided by a description generated by a video LLM, which explains
the agent's policy in video form. We evaluated VIRAL in five Gymnasium
environments, demonstrating that it accelerates the learning of new behaviors
while ensuring improved alignment with user intent. The source-code and demo
video are available at: https://github.com/VIRAL-UCBL1/VIRAL and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 动态屏蔽是一种运行时安全执行工具，能够根据参数化安全规范动态调整，避免传统静态屏蔽在安全需求变化时需重新计算的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏蔽工具针对特定安全需求静态设计，无法适应运行时安全需求的变化，可能导致致命延迟。动态屏蔽旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出动态屏蔽方法，基于参数化安全规范静态设计，运行时通过简单快速算法动态调整，利用标准安全屏蔽的特性（如最大允许性）。

Result: 在机器人导航实验中，动态屏蔽离线设计仅需几分钟，在线调整时间为几分之一秒至几秒，比暴力在线重计算方法快5倍。

Conclusion: 动态屏蔽有效解决了运行时安全需求变化的适应性问题，显著提升了效率和实用性。

Abstract: Shielding has emerged as a promising approach for ensuring safety of
AI-controlled autonomous systems. The algorithmic goal is to compute a shield,
which is a runtime safety enforcement tool that needs to monitor and intervene
the AI controller's actions if safety could be compromised otherwise.
Traditional shields are designed statically for a specific safety requirement.
Therefore, if the safety requirement changes at runtime due to changing
operating conditions, the shield needs to be recomputed from scratch, causing
delays that could be fatal. We introduce dynamic shields for parametric safety
specifications, which are succinctly represented sets of all possible safety
specifications that may be encountered at runtime. Our dynamic shields are
statically designed for a given safety parameter set, and are able to
dynamically adapt as the true safety specification (permissible by the
parameters) is revealed at runtime. The main algorithmic novelty lies in the
dynamic adaptation procedure, which is a simple and fast algorithm that
utilizes known features of standard safety shields, like maximal
permissiveness. We report experimental results for a robot navigation problem
in unknown territories, where the safety specification evolves as new obstacles
are discovered at runtime. In our experiments, the dynamic shields took a few
minutes for their offline design, and took between a fraction of a second and a
few seconds for online adaptation at each step, whereas the brute-force online
recomputation approach was up to 5 times slower.

<details>

Motivation: 探索VLLMs在认知灵活性方面的表现，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 使用威斯康星卡片分类测试（WCST）评估VLLMs的认知灵活性，并分析输入模态和提示策略的影响。

Result: VLLMs在文本输入下表现优异，且能通过角色扮演模拟认知灵活性缺陷。

Conclusion: VLLMs在认知灵活性方面接近人类水平，可用于模拟复杂大脑过程。

Abstract: Cognitive flexibility has been extensively studied in human cognition but
remains relatively unexplored in the context of Visual Large Language Models
(VLLMs). This study assesses the cognitive flexibility of state-of-the-art
VLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet) using the Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test (WCST), a classic measure of set-shifting ability. Our results
reveal that VLLMs achieve or surpass human-level set-shifting capabilities
under chain-of-thought prompting with text-based inputs. However, their
abilities are highly influenced by both input modality and prompting strategy.
In addition, we find that through role-playing, VLLMs can simulate various
functional deficits aligned with patients having impairments in cognitive
flexibility, suggesting that VLLMs may possess a cognitive architecture, at
least regarding the ability of set-shifting, similar to the brain. This study
reveals the fact that VLLMs have already approached the human level on a key
component underlying our higher cognition, and highlights the potential to use
them to emulate complex brain processes.

Result: 实验表明，Foreplan实现了至少四个数量级的加速。

Conclusion: Foreplan能够高效处理大规模不可区分对象和动作的规划问题，并提供了理论支持和实际验证。

Abstract: Decision making is a central problem in AI that can be formalized using a
Markov Decision Process. A problem is that, with increasing numbers of
(indistinguishable) objects, the state space grows exponentially. To compute
policies, the state space has to be enumerated. Even more possibilities have to
be enumerated if the size of the action space depends on the size of the state
space, especially if we allow concurrent actions. To tackle the exponential
blow-up in the action and state space, we present a first-order representation
to store the spaces in polynomial instead of exponential size in the number of
objects and introduce Foreplan, a relational forward planner, which uses this
representation to efficiently compute policies for numerous indistinguishable
objects and actions. Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate
version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent
should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions. Further, we provide
a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation of Foreplan, demonstrating a
speedup of at least four orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: LCoT2Tree是诊断、解释和改进LLM推理的强大工具，强调了推理链内部结构的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
popularized Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), a strategy that encourages deliberate
and step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer. While LCoTs have
enabled expert-level performance in complex tasks, how the internal structures
of their reasoning chains drive, or even predict, the correctness of final
answers remains a critical yet underexplored question. In this work, we present
LCoT2Tree, an automated framework that converts sequential LCoTs into
hierarchical tree structures and thus enables deeper structural analysis of LLM
reasoning. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we reveal that structural
patterns extracted by LCoT2Tree, including exploration, backtracking, and
verification, serve as stronger predictors of final performance across a wide
range of tasks and models. Leveraging an explainability technique, we further
identify critical thought patterns such as over-branching that account for
failures. Beyond diagnostic insights, the structural patterns by LCoT2Tree
support practical applications, including improving Best-of-N decoding
effectiveness. Overall, our results underscore the critical role of internal
structures of reasoning chains, positioning LCoT2Tree as a powerful tool for
diagnosing, interpreting, and improving reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现实场景中（如道路网络），双目标优化问题常涉及相关目标（如时间和油耗），传统方法计算复杂度高，需高效算法。

Result: 在DIMACS数据集上，算法运行速度提升至多5倍，且保证解的质量。

Conclusion: 该算法首次有效利用目标相关性，显著提升双目标搜索效率，并具有理论保证。

Abstract: The bi-objective shortest-path (BOSP) problem seeks to find paths between
start and target vertices of a graph while optimizing two conflicting objective
functions. We consider the BOSP problem in the presence of correlated
objectives. Such correlations often occur in real-world settings such as road
networks, where optimizing two positively correlated objectives, such as travel
time and fuel consumption, is common. BOSP is generally computationally
challenging as the size of the search space is exponential in the number of
objective functions and the graph size. Bounded sub-optimal BOSP solvers such
as A*pex alleviate this complexity by approximating the Pareto-optimal solution
set rather than computing it exactly (given a user-provided approximation
factor). As the correlation between objective functions increases, smaller
approximation factors are sufficient for collapsing the entire Pareto-optimal
set into a single solution. We leverage this insight to propose an efficient
algorithm that reduces the search effort in the presence of correlated
objectives. Our approach for computing approximations of the entire
Pareto-optimal set is inspired by graph-clustering algorithms. It uses a
preprocessing phase to identify correlated clusters within a graph and to
generate a new graph representation. This allows a natural generalization of
A*pex to run up to five times faster on DIMACS dataset instances, a standard
benchmark in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
algorithm proposed that efficiently and effectively exploits correlations in
the context of bi-objective search while providing theoretical guarantees on
solution quality.

Method: 提出一种层次化方法，计算ε值的层次结构，确保模型的层次性，并提供误差界限的层次结构。

Result: 该方法能够高效构建层次化模型，允许在压缩与准确性之间明确权衡，并提升模型解释性。

Conclusion: 层次化方法解决了ACP中超参数选择的问题，提供了更高效和可解释的模型构建方式。

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models that encode indistinguishable objects and
relations among them use first-order logic constructs to compress a
propositional factorised model for more efficient (lifted) inference. To obtain
a lifted representation, the state-of-the-art algorithm Advanced Colour Passing
(ACP) groups factors that represent matching distributions. In an approximate
version using $\varepsilon$ as a hyperparameter, factors are grouped that
differ by a factor of at most $(1\pm \varepsilon)$. However, finding a suitable
$\varepsilon$ is not obvious and may need a lot of exploration, possibly
requiring many ACP runs with different $\varepsilon$ values. Additionally,
varying $\varepsilon$ can yield wildly different models, leading to decreased
interpretability. Therefore, this paper presents a hierarchical approach to
lifted model construction that is hyperparameter-free. It efficiently computes
a hierarchy of $\varepsilon$ values that ensures a hierarchy of models, meaning
that once factors are grouped together given some $\varepsilon$, these factors
will be grouped together for larger $\varepsilon$ as well. The hierarchy of
$\varepsilon$ values also leads to a hierarchy of error bounds. This allows for
explicitly weighing compression versus accuracy when choosing specific
$\varepsilon$ values to run ACP with and enables interpretability between the
different models.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，现有评估范式低估了LLMs的真实潜力，需重新设计更全面的评估策略以充分挖掘其能力。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when
trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant
challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature
relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for
evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs'
deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance
ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of
in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find
that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with
internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on
tasks previously deemed "unsolvable" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%).
We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this
combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on
controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our
approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to
previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically,
we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling,
significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems.
These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs
on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically
underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment
of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that
fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a
better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world
deployments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted
critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and
communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and
agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing
interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among
multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and
solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In
this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery
system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and
securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and
technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS,
AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic
service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the
architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating
its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: AIM展示了LRMs在数学发现中的潜力，未来可能显著加速数学研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have made significant progress in mathematical
capabilities in recent times. However, these successes have been primarily
confined to competition-level problems. In this work, we propose AI
Mathematician (AIM) framework, which harnesses the reasoning strength of LRMs
to support frontier mathematical research. We have identified two critical
challenges of mathematical research compared to competition, {\it the intrinsic
complexity of research problems} and {\it the requirement of procedural rigor}.
To address these challenges, AIM incorporates two core strategies: an
exploration mechanism to foster longer solution paths, and the pessimistic
reasonable verification method to ensure reliability.
  This early version of AIM already exhibits strong capability in tackling
research-level tasks. We conducted extensive experiments across several
real-world mathematical topics and obtained promising results. AIM is able to
autonomously construct substantial portions of proofs and uncover non-trivial
insights within each research area. These findings highlight the potential of
LRMs in mathematical discovery and suggest that LRM-based agent systems could
significantly accelerate mathematical research in the future.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested
using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also
benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that
enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical
Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a
structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To
bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that
automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems.
HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting
multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This
paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting
the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym
interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also
provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym
framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from
International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain.
Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent
scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked
domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a
valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in
multi-agent contexts.

Motivation: 随着语言模型能力和自主性的提升，红队测试的漏洞识别对安全部署至关重要，但传统方法在能力差距下可能失效。

Method: 通过评估500多个攻击者-目标模型对，模拟人类红队行为，分析能力差距对攻击成功率的影响。

Result: 发现攻击成功率与攻击者能力正相关，目标能力超过攻击者时攻击成功率骤降，且与MMLU-Pro基准的社会科学表现相关。

Conclusion: 固定能力的攻击者（如人类）可能对未来的模型无效，开源模型能力提升会增加风险，需准确评估和控制模型的操纵能力。

Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying
vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However,
traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once
red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass
red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through
the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more
than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic
human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three
strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack
success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and
(iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science
splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking
scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on
attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability
attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models,
increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and
model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and
manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.

Motivation: 探索LLM与KG结合对用户信任、探索策略和决策的影响，解决LLM辅助KG分析系统的设计挑战。

Method: 开发LinkQ系统，通过LLM将自然语言问题转换为结构化查询，并设计五种可视化机制帮助用户评估准确性。

Result: 用户（包括KG专家）倾向于过度信任系统输出，且工作流因用户背景而异，挑战了通用设计的假设。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM辅助工具中虚假信任的风险，并指出可视化作为缓解技术的潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful data structures, but exploring them
effectively remains difficult for even expert users. Large language models
(LLMs) are increasingly used to address this gap, yet little is known
empirically about how their usage with KGs shapes user trust, exploration
strategies, or downstream decision-making - raising key design challenges for
LLM-based KG visual analysis systems. To study these effects, we developed
LinkQ, a KG exploration system that converts natural language questions into
structured queries with an LLM. We collaborated with KG experts to design five
visual mechanisms that help users assess the accuracy of both KG queries and
LLM responses: an LLM-KG state diagram that illustrates which stage of the
exploration pipeline LinkQ is in, a query editor displaying the generated query
paired with an LLM explanation, an entity-relation ID table showing extracted
KG entities and relations with semantic descriptions, a query structure graph
that depicts the path traversed in the KG, and an interactive graph
visualization of query results. From a qualitative evaluation with 14
practitioners, we found that users - even KG experts - tended to overtrust
LinkQ's outputs due to its "helpful" visualizations, even when the LLM was
incorrect. Users exhibited distinct workflows depending on their prior
familiarity with KGs and LLMs, challenging the assumption that these systems
are one-size-fits-all - despite often being designed as if they are. Our
findings highlight the risks of false trust in LLM-assisted data analysis tools
and the need for further investigation into the role of visualization as a
mitigation technique.

Motivation: 现有基准常忽视任务特定性能、上下文理解和变量范围等关键因素，SIMCOPILOT旨在填补这一空白，评估LLM在实际编码场景中的实用性。

Method: 通过SIMCOPILOTJ（Java）和SIMCOPILOTP（Python）子基准，覆盖不同规模和复杂度的代码库，进行多领域评估。

Result: 评估揭示了模型优势和在复杂依赖结构中保持逻辑一致性的挑战，同时指出了LLM当前在代码生成中的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce SIMCOPILOT, a benchmark that simulates the role of large
language models (LLMs) as interactive, "copilot"-style coding assistants.
Targeting both completion (finishing incomplete methods or code blocks) and
infill tasks (filling missing segments within existing code), SIMCOPILOT
provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM coding capabilities. The
benchmark comprises dedicated sub-benchmarks for Java (SIMCOPILOTJ) and Python
(SIMCOPILOTP), covering diverse codebases varying in size and complexity. Our
key contributions include: (a) establishing a realistic, detailed evaluation
environment to assess LLM utility in practical coding scenarios, and (b)
providing fine-grained analyses that address critical factors frequently
overlooked by existing benchmarks, such as task-specific performance nuances,
contextual understanding across code segments, and sensitivity to variable
scope. Evaluations conducted across domains-including algorithms, databases,
computer vision, and neural networks-offer insights into model strengths and
highlight persistent challenges in maintaining logical consistency within
complex dependency structures. Beyond benchmarking, our study sheds light on
the current limitations of LLM-driven code generation and underscores the
ongoing transition of LLMs from merely syntax-aware generators toward reliable,
intelligent software development partners.

TL;DR: TERSE是一种针对多变量时间序列（MTS）的无源域自适应（SFDA）方法，通过时空特征编码和任务设计，解决了现有方法忽略空间相关性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法在多变量时间序列（MTS）上表现不佳，主要因为它们未能考虑MTS数据固有的空间相关性，而这些相关性对跨域信息保持至关重要。

Method: 提出TERSE方法，包含定制的时空特征编码器，以及时间恢复和空间重连任务，以恢复被掩码的时间序列和空间结构。

Result: 在三个真实时间序列数据集上的实验表明，TERSE能有效建模和转移跨域时空依赖关系，实现隐式特征对齐。

Conclusion: TERSE是首个同时考虑时空一致性的MTS-SFDA方法，可作为通用模块集成到现有SFDA方法中，具有高效性和多功能性。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model from
an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain without accessing the
source data, thereby preserving data privacy. While existing SFDA methods have
proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform
well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the
intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations
are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant
information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal
Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method
tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized
spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying
spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and
spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally
masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the
target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and
temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source
pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore,
TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across
domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first
approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA,
TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into
established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Conclusion: ChemHAS能有效补偿工具预测误差，为科学研究中AI代理应用提供新可能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to
improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools.
However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors
of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how
LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the
tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking),
a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing
agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art
performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our
method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools.
Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking
behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new
possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research. Our code and

TL;DR: FCOS是一种新颖的两阶段剪枝框架，结合通道级剪枝和层崩溃诊断，实现高效压缩和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动调制识别方法难以满足现代场景需求，深度学习AMR方法虽提升精度，但模型复杂度过高，难以部署在资源受限设备上。

Method: FCOS采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段通过层次聚类和参数融合实现通道级剪枝；第二阶段通过层崩溃诊断模块移除崩溃层。

Result: FCOS在多个AMR基准测试中表现优异，实现95.51% FLOPs和95.31%参数减少，精度仅下降0.46%。

Conclusion: FCOS在保持高性能的同时实现极端压缩，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: With the rapid development of wireless communications and the growing
complexity of digital modulation schemes, traditional manual modulation
recognition methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet
real-time requirements in modern scenarios. Recently, deep learning based
Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) approaches have greatly improved
classification accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high
computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Model
pruning provides a general approach to reduce model complexity, but existing
weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques each present a trade-off between
compression rate, hardware acceleration, and accuracy preservation. To this
end, in this paper, we introduce FCOS, a novel Fine-to-COarse two-Stage pruning
framework that combines channel-level pruning with layer-level collapse
diagnosis to achieve extreme compression, high performance and efficient
inference. In the first stage of FCOS, hierarchical clustering and parameter
fusion are applied to channel weights to achieve channel-level pruning. Then a
Layer Collapse Diagnosis (LaCD) module uses linear probing to identify layer
collapse and removes the collapsed layers due to high channel compression
ratio. Experiments on multiple AMR benchmarks demonstrate that FCOS outperforms
existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, FCOS achieves 95.51%
FLOPs reduction and 95.31% parameter reduction while still maintaining
performance close to the original ResNet56, with only a 0.46% drop in accuracy
on Sig2019-12. Code is available at https://github.com/yaolu-zjut/FCOS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器需要精确的离散化和完整的PDE知识，而数据驱动的神经PDE求解器需要大量训练数据。SINO旨在解决这些限制，尤其是在数据稀缺和未知PDE项的情况下。

Method: SINO在频域中操作，引入频率到向量模块学习谱表示，设计了非线性算子块（包括低通滤波的Π块）以建模非线性物理交互，并采用算子蒸馏技术进行高效推理。

Result: SINO在多个PDE基准测试中表现优异，具有强离散不变性和对分布外初始条件的鲁棒性，能够准确模拟全局耦合系统（如Navier-Stokes方程）。

Conclusion: SINO是首个无需显式PDE项即可从有限数据中准确模拟全局耦合系统的物理感知方法，为未知PDE系统的快速推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern the spatiotemporal evolution of
various physical systems. Classical numerical solvers, while accurate, require
fine discretization and full knowledge of the governing PDEs, limiting their
applicability when the physics is unknown or fast inference is required.
Data-driven neural PDE solvers alleviate these constraints by learning from
data but demand large training datasets and perform poorly in data-scarce
regimes. Physics-aware methods mitigate data requirements by incorporating
physical knowledge yet rely on known PDE terms or local numerical schemes,
restricting their ability to handle unknown or globally coupled systems. In
this work, we propose the Spectral-inspired Neural Operator (SINO), a novel
framework that learns PDE operators from limited trajectories (as few as 2-5),
without any known PDE terms. SINO operates in the frequency domain and
introduces a Frequency-to-Vector module to learn spectral representations
analogous to derivative multipliers. To model nonlinear physical interactions,
we design a nonlinear operator block that includes a $\Pi$-Block with low-pass
filtering to prevent aliasing. Finally, we introduce an operator distillation
technique to distill the trained model for efficient inference. SINO achieves
state-of-the-art results across multiple PDE benchmarks, demonstrating strong
discretization invariance and robust generalization to out-of-distribution
initial conditions. To our knowledge, SINO is the first physics-aware method
capable of accurately simulating globally coupled systems (e.g., the
Navier-Stokes equations) from limited data without any explicit PDE terms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签分布学习（LDL）忽略了标签的绝对描述度，导致信息丢失和实例混淆。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了背景浓度的概念。

Method: 作者结合概率方法和神经网络，提出了一个新型模型，用于从现有LDL数据集中学习标签分布和背景浓度。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够从标签分布中提取背景浓度，并比现有LDL方法提供更准确的预测结果。

Conclusion: 通过引入背景浓度，本文提出的方法显著改进了标签分布学习的效果。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an effective method to predict the
relative label description degree (a.k.a. label distribution) of a sample.
However, the label distribution is not a complete representation of an instance
because it overlooks the absolute intensity of each label. Specifically, it's
impossible to obtain the total description degree of hidden labels that not in
the label space, which leads to the loss of information and confusion in
instances. To solve the above problem, we come up with a new concept named
background concentration to serve as the absolute description degree term of
the label distribution and introduce it into the LDL process, forming the
improved paradigm of concentration distribution learning. Moreover, we propose
a novel model by probabilistic methods and neural networks to learn label
distributions and background concentrations from existing LDL datasets.
Extensive experiments prove that the proposed approach is able to extract
background concentrations from label distributions while producing more
accurate prediction results than the state-of-the-art LDL methods. The code is
available in https://github.com/seutjw/CDL-LD.

Result: 分析揭示了现有方法的局限性，如架构视角单一、模拟与实际情况脱节、定义混淆系统与用户保护等。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究应更全面、情境感知，并关注多利益相关者的公平性需求。

Abstract: Fairness in federated learning has emerged as a rapidly growing area of
research, with numerous works proposing formal definitions and algorithmic
interventions. Yet, despite this technical progress, fairness in FL is often
defined and evaluated in ways that abstract away from the sociotechnical
contexts in which these systems are deployed. In this paper, we argue that
existing approaches tend to optimize narrow system level metrics, such as
performance parity or contribution-based rewards, while overlooking how harms
arise throughout the FL lifecycle and how they impact diverse stakeholders. We
support this claim through a critical analysis of the literature, based on a
systematic annotation of papers for their fairness definitions, design
decisions, evaluation practices, and motivating use cases. Our analysis reveals
five recurring pitfalls: 1) fairness framed solely through the lens of server
client architecture, 2) a mismatch between simulations and motivating use-cases
and contexts, 3) definitions that conflate protecting the system with
protecting its users, 4) interventions that target isolated stages of the
lifecycle while neglecting upstream and downstream effects, 5) and a lack of
multi-stakeholder alignment where multiple fairness definitions can be relevant
at once. Building on these insights, we propose a harm centered framework that
links fairness definitions to concrete risks and stakeholder vulnerabilities.
We conclude with recommendations for more holistic, context-aware, and
accountable fairness research in FL.

Result: 理论和实验验证表明，CellCLAT在自监督图学习任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CellCLAT为细胞复合体的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案，是该领域的重要尝试。

Abstract: Self-supervised topological deep learning (TDL) represents a nascent but
underexplored area with significant potential for modeling higher-order
interactions in simplicial complexes and cellular complexes to derive
representations of unlabeled graphs. Compared to simplicial complexes, cellular
complexes exhibit greater expressive power. However, the advancement in
self-supervised learning for cellular TDL is largely hindered by two core
challenges: \textit{extrinsic structural constraints} inherent to cellular
complexes, and intrinsic semantic redundancy in cellular representations. The
first challenge highlights that traditional graph augmentation techniques may
compromise the integrity of higher-order cellular interactions, while the
second underscores that topological redundancy in cellular complexes
potentially diminish task-relevant information. To address these issues, we
introduce Cellular Complex Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Trimming
(CellCLAT), a twofold framework designed to adhere to the combinatorial
constraints of cellular complexes while mitigating informational redundancy.
Specifically, we propose a parameter perturbation-based augmentation method
that injects controlled noise into cellular interactions without altering the
underlying cellular structures, thereby preserving cellular topology during
contrastive learning. Additionally, a cellular trimming scheduler is employed
to mask gradient contributions from task-irrelevant cells through a bi-level
meta-learning approach, effectively removing redundant topological elements
while maintaining critical higher-order semantics. We provide theoretical
justification and empirical validation to demonstrate that CellCLAT achieves
substantial improvements over existing self-supervised graph learning methods,
marking a significant attempt in this domain.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在4位浮点量化中表现优异，优于现有的4位整数量化方法。

Conclusion: MSFP框架成功解决了扩散模型中的4位量化挑战，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model quantization reduces the bit-width of weights and activations,
improving memory efficiency and inference speed in diffusion models. However,
achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily
based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning,
struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of
floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit
FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure
of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the
insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process
during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and
quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign
floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP
quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and
denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve
superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models,
outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.

Method: 提出Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop)，选择性遮挡输入中最相关的区域，促使模型利用其他特征。

Result: 实验表明，RelDrop提高了模型对遮挡的鲁棒性，使模型利用更多感兴趣区域的特征，并提升了推理时的泛化性能。

Conclusion: RelDrop是一种有效的数据增强方法，通过针对性遮挡相关区域，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Overfitting is a well-known issue extending even to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
Machine Learning (ML) models, resulting in reduced generalization, and a
significant train-test performance gap. Mitigation measures include a
combination of dropout, data augmentation, weight decay, and other
regularization techniques. Among the various data augmentation strategies,
occlusion is a prominent technique that typically focuses on randomly masking
regions of the input during training. Most of the existing literature
emphasizes randomness in selecting and modifying the input features instead of
regions that strongly influence model decisions. We propose Relevance-driven
Input Dropout (RelDrop), a novel data augmentation method which selectively
occludes the most relevant regions of the input, nudging the model to use other
important features in the prediction process, thus improving model
generalization through informed regularization. We further conduct qualitative
and quantitative analyses to study how Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop)
affects model decision-making. Through a series of experiments on benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness towards
occlusion, results in models utilizing more features within the region of
interest, and boosts inference time generalization performance. Our code is

Result: 前沿模型在SOSBench中表现出高比例的有害响应（如Deepseek-R1为79.1%，GPT-4.1为47.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型安全对齐的严重不足，强调了负责任部署强大LLM的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks,
such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience
against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks,
remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on
instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to
build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g.,
multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently,
they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive,
hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded,
hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains:
chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The
benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws,
systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that
introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive
synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate
frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench.
Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose
policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high
rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1).
These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and
underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful
LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著优于固定分布的经典经验风险最小化方法。

Conclusion: 分布感知训练是提升OOD泛化的有效框架。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in
machine learning. Models trained on one data distribution often experience
substantial performance degradation when evaluated on shifted or unseen
domains. To address this challenge, the present paper studies the design of
training data distributions that maximize average-case OOD performance. First,
a theoretical analysis establishes a family of generalization bounds that
quantify how the choice of training distribution influences OOD error across a
predefined family of target distributions. These insights motivate the
introduction of two complementary algorithmic strategies: (i) directly
formulating OOD risk minimization as a bilevel optimization problem over the
space of probability measures and (ii) minimizing a theoretical upper bound on
OOD error. Last, the paper evaluates the two approaches across a range of
function approximation and operator learning examples. The proposed methods
significantly improve OOD accuracy over standard empirical risk minimization
with a fixed distribution. These results highlight the potential of
distribution-aware training as a principled and practical framework for robust
OOD generalization.

Abstract: The relationship between inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and inverse
optimization (IO) for Markov decision processes (MDPs) has been relatively
underexplored in the literature, despite addressing the same problem. In this
work, we revisit the relationship between the IO framework for MDPs, IRL, and
apprenticeship learning (AL). We incorporate prior beliefs on the structure of
the cost function into the IRL and AL problems, and demonstrate that the
convex-analytic view of the AL formalism (Kamoutsi et al., 2021) emerges as a
relaxation of our framework. Notably, the AL formalism is a special case in our
framework when the regularization term is absent. Focusing on the suboptimal
expert setting, we formulate the AL problem as a regularized min-max problem.
The regularizer plays a key role in addressing the ill-posedness of IRL by
guiding the search for plausible cost functions. To solve the resulting
regularized-convex-concave-min-max problem, we use stochastic mirror descent
(SMD) and establish convergence bounds for the proposed method. Numerical
experiments highlight the critical role of regularization in learning cost
vectors and apprentice policies.

Conclusion: 新模型在对称流形上实现了高效且高质量的扩散生成，缩小了与欧几里得空间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models for
$d$-dimensional symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds, including the torus,
sphere, special orthogonal group and unitary group. Existing manifold diffusion
models often depend on heat kernels, which lack closed-form expressions and
require either $d$ gradient evaluations or exponential-in-$d$ arithmetic
operations per training step. We introduce a new diffusion model for symmetric
manifolds with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing us to leverage a
projection of Euclidean Brownian motion to bypass heat kernel computations. Our
training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's
Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and
nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap
between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold
symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz
condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirically, our
model outperforms prior methods in training speed and improves sample quality
on synthetic datasets on the torus, special orthogonal group, and unitary
group.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学等安全关键应用中，需要可靠的ATE推断和隐私保护，但现有方法难以同时满足这两点。

Method: PrivATE框架通过三步实现：差分私有ATE估计、差分私有方差估计和CI构建，同时考虑估计和隐私化的不确定性。

Result: PrivATE框架是模型无关且双重稳健的，能够生成有效的CI，并在合成和真实医学数据上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PrivATE是首个在差分隐私下提供双重稳健且通用ATE CI的框架。

Abstract: The average treatment effect (ATE) is widely used to evaluate the
effectiveness of drugs and other medical interventions. In safety-critical
applications like medicine, reliable inferences about the ATE typically require
valid uncertainty quantification, such as through confidence intervals (CIs).
However, estimating treatment effects in these settings often involves
sensitive data that must be kept private. In this work, we present PrivATE, a
novel machine learning framework for computing CIs for the ATE under
differential privacy. Specifically, we focus on deriving valid
privacy-preserving CIs for the ATE from observational data. Our PrivATE
framework consists of three steps: (i) estimating a differentially private ATE
through output perturbation; (ii) estimating the differentially private
variance through a truncated output perturbation mechanism; and (iii)
constructing the CIs while accounting for the uncertainty from both the
estimation and privatization steps. Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic,
doubly robust, and ensures valid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework using synthetic and real-world medical datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to derive a general, doubly robust framework for
valid CIs of the ATE under ($\varepsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy.

*Nikola Surjanovic,Alexandre Bouchard-Côté,Trevor Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSGD是一种自动调整学习率的SGD方法，无需用户手动调参，理论支持其收敛性，并在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率对SGD性能影响重大，但手动调参耗时费力，因此提出自动调整学习率的方法。

Method: AutoSGD通过判断当前迭代是否需要增减学习率，并采取相应行动，同时提供理论支持其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，AutoSGD在传统优化问题和机器学习任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: AutoSGD是一种高效且自动化的学习率调整方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: The learning rate is an important tuning parameter for stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) and can greatly influence its performance. However, appropriate
selection of a learning rate schedule across all iterations typically requires
a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort. To address this, we introduce
AutoSGD: an SGD method that automatically determines whether to increase or
decrease the learning rate at a given iteration and then takes appropriate
action. We introduce theory supporting the convergence of AutoSGD, along with
its deterministic counterpart for standard gradient descent. Empirical results
suggest strong performance of the method on a variety of traditional
optimization problems and machine learning tasks.

*Xiaojie Xu,Xinli Xu,Sirui Chen,Haoyu Chen,Fan Zhang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PreGenie是一个基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的模块化框架，用于生成高质量的视觉演示文稿，解决了传统自动化工具在布局、文本摘要和图像理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动化工具生成的演示文稿在布局、文本摘要和图像理解上存在问题，限制了其在正式场景（如商业和科研）中的应用。PreGenie旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PreGenie基于Slidev框架，分两阶段工作：分析与初始生成、审查与重新生成，利用多个协作的MLLMs迭代优化演示文稿。

Result: 实验表明，PreGenie在多模态理解和内容一致性上优于现有模型，更符合人类设计偏好。

Conclusion: PreGenie通过模块化和迭代优化，显著提升了自动化生成演示文稿的质量和适用性。

Abstract: Visual presentations are vital for effective communication. Early attempts to
automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly
organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image
understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations
restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific
research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and
modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for
generating high-quality visual presentations.
  PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are
rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and
Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial
code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate
code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each
stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal
understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content
consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.

TL;DR: SLCD是一种基于监督学习的可控扩散生成方法，通过迭代生成在线数据并训练小型分类器来指导扩散模型生成，避免了强化学习的复杂性和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习方法在可控生成中容易过拟合奖励函数且资源消耗大，因此需要一种更高效且简单的方法。

Method: SLCD通过训练小型分类器指导扩散模型生成，利用KL正则化目标函数优化生成分布，无需复杂强化学习或控制概念。

Result: SLCD在图像和生物序列生成中均能高效生成高质量样本，推理时间接近基础模型。

Conclusion: SLCD提供了一种简单高效的可控生成方法，理论证明其收敛性，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: The controllable generation of diffusion models aims to steer the model to
generate samples that optimize some given objective functions. It is desirable
for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation,
and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of
the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function
while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a
problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective
function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion,
which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide
the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard
classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification
and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction
to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the
output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the
KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can
generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base
model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological
sequence generation with discrete diffusion. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着社会对生成AI工具的依赖增加，理解模型间通过数据交互训练的潜在影响变得至关重要。

Method: 通过实证研究、理论建模和实验，分析了数据介导的模型交互过程及其长期效果。

Result: 数据介导的交互可能帮助模型学习新概念，但也可能导致任务表现的趋同。

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解模型间数据交互的重要性，并指出了其潜在的双重影响。

Abstract: The internet is full of AI-generated content while also serving as a common
source of training data for generative AI (genAI) models. This duality raises
the possibility that future genAI models may be trained on other models'
generated outputs. Prior work has studied consequences of models training on
their own generated outputs, but limited work has considered what happens if
models ingest content produced by other models. Given society's increasing
dependence on genAI tools, understanding downstream effects of such
data-mediated model interactions is critical. To this end, we provide empirical
evidence for how data-mediated interactions might unfold in practice, develop a
theoretical model for this interactive training process, and show
experimentally possible long-term results of such interactions. We find that
data-mediated interactions can benefit models by exposing them to novel
concepts perhaps missed in original training data, but also can homogenize
their performance on shared tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据常混合类别和数值，且记录间隔不规则。现有方法在数值表示或类别数据处理上存在局限。

Method: 采用自回归序列分解、嵌入方案和联合分布似然估计的损失函数，扩展Transformer模型。

Result: 在简单物理系统和复杂时间序列（如心电图和电子健康记录数据）中表现良好。

Conclusion: 扩展了Transformer模型在混合数据建模中的适用性。

Abstract: Real-world processes often generate data that are a mix of categorical and
numeric values that are recorded at irregular and informative intervals.
Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity
while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited
for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle
certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single
architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized
text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence
decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token
prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next
token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn
to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series
including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data.
This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes
of data.

Result: 成功训练了一个1.2B参数的模型，并通过真实代币奖励参与者，证明了激励系统的有效性。

Conclusion: Gauntlet系统在无需许可的分布式训练中表现出色，为类似场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We describe an incentive system for distributed deep learning of foundational
models where peers are rewarded for contributions. The incentive system,
\textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to
train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of
pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their
hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed
training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely
on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and
synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss
before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an
OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores
across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the
network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out
real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions,
yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates
the utility of our incentive system.

Result: GDA成为AMSFL框架的关键组件，为大规模多步自适应训练提供统一的误差建模策略。

Conclusion: GDA方法在联邦学习中有效平衡了通信效率和模型精度，适用于大规模自适应训练。

Abstract: Federated learning faces critical challenges in balancing communication
efficiency and model accuracy. One key issue lies in the approximation of
update errors without incurring high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a lightweight yet effective method called Gradient Difference
Approximation (GDA), which leverages first-order information to estimate local
error trends without computing the full Hessian matrix. The proposed method
forms a key component of the Adaptive Multi-Step Federated Learning (AMSFL)
framework and provides a unified error modeling strategy for large-scale
multi-step adaptive training environments.

TL;DR: LrcSSM是一种非线性循环模型，能高效处理长序列，速度与线性状态空间层相当，并提供梯度稳定性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型（如Liquid-S4和Mamba）在处理长序列时的效率与稳定性问题。

Method: 通过强制状态转移矩阵为对角矩阵并逐步学习，实现并行计算，降低时间和内存复杂度。

Result: 在长序列预测任务中，LrcSSM优于LRU、S5和Mamba。

Conclusion: LrcSSM是一种高效且稳定的长序列处理模型，适用于计算优化场景。

Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a \textit{nonlinear} recurrent model that processes long
sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the
state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full
sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving
$\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential
depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover,
LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying
systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth
$L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its
low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the
compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for
Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while
avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a
series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

Motivation: 探索GD在深度ReLU网络中的初始行为，特别是如何从参数空间中的鞍点逃离，并理解逃离方向的性质。

Method: 通过数学分析，研究逃离方向的特征，特别是其低秩偏置，并证明相关定理。

Result: 发现最优逃离方向在深层具有低秩偏置，第一奇异值显著大于其他奇异值。

Conclusion: 这是证明深度ReLU网络中GD动态从鞍点到鞍点（Saddle-to-Saddle）的第一步。

Abstract: When a deep ReLU network is initialized with small weights, GD is at first
dominated by the saddle at the origin in parameter space. We study the
so-called escape directions, which play a similar role as the eigenvectors of
the Hessian for strict saddles. We show that the optimal escape direction
features a low-rank bias in its deeper layers: the first singular value of the
$\ell$-th layer weight matrix is at least $\ell^{\frac{1}{4}}$ larger than any
other singular value. We also prove a number of related results about these
escape directions. We argue that this result is a first step in proving
Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics in deep ReLU networks, where GD visits a sequence of
saddles with increasing bottleneck rank.

Result: RL智能体在简化任务中性能大幅下降，依赖捷径行为。

Conclusion: 需新基准和方法以测试系统泛化能力，静态评估不足以实现人类智能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieve impressive results in a wide
variety of tasks, but they lack zero-shot adaptation capabilities. While most
robustness evaluations focus on tasks complexifications, for which human also
struggle to maintain performances, no evaluation has been performed on tasks
simplifications. To tackle this issue, we introduce HackAtari, a set of task
variations of the Arcade Learning Environments. We use it to demonstrate that,
contrary to humans, RL agents systematically exhibit huge performance drops on
simpler versions of their training tasks, uncovering agents' consistent
reliance on shortcuts. Our analysis across multiple algorithms and
architectures highlights the persistent gap between RL agents and human
behavioral intelligence, underscoring the need for new benchmarks and
methodologies that enforce systematic generalization testing beyond static
evaluation protocols. Training and testing in the same environment is not
enough to obtain agents equipped with human-like intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练基础模型（如ViTs和LLMs）计算成本高昂，低秩矩阵或张量分解虽参数高效，但性能受限。

Method: 提出LaX模块，通过信息流跨低秩子空间增强低秩模型能力，并在ViT和LLaMA模型上验证。

Result: LaX使低秩模型性能接近或超过全秩基线，参数减少2-3倍；在LLaMA微调任务中性能提升且成本极低。

Conclusion: LaX是一种高效且低成本的解决方案，适用于大规模模型的预训练和微调。

Abstract: Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous
computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a
parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the
restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing
(LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the
capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank
subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks
with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters.
LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank
baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with
low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently
improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with
negligible cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的交通安全学习方法，通过生成和分析未发生的危险场景（近失事件）来补充传统的事故数据，以实现更主动的预防措施。


<details>

Motivation: 传统的事故频率模型和替代安全指标依赖于稀疏、噪声大且报告不足的数据，难以有效预防罕见但严重的交通事故。

Method: 结合生成场景引擎、多样化驾驶员模型和因果学习，合成并解释近失事件；通过数字孪生测试平台和多目标验证器，将稀疏的事故数据转化为丰富的预测信号。

Result: 该方法能够生成大量未发生的危险场景，用于预测和测试车辆、道路及政策的安全性，从而更主动地预防事故。

Conclusion: 通过从“几乎发生的事故”中学习，交通安全可以从被动的事后分析转向主动预防，推动实现“零愿景”目标。

Abstract: Traffic safety science has long been hindered by a fundamental data paradox:
the crashes we most wish to prevent are precisely those events we rarely
observe. Existing crash-frequency models and surrogate safety metrics rely
heavily on sparse, noisy, and under-reported records, while even sophisticated,
high-fidelity simulations undersample the long-tailed situations that trigger
catastrophic outcomes such as fatalities. We argue that the path to achieving
Vision Zero, i.e., the complete elimination of traffic fatalities and severe
injuries, requires a paradigm shift from traditional crash-only learning to a
new form of counterfactual safety learning: reasoning not only about what
happened, but also about the vast set of plausible yet perilous scenarios that
could have happened under slightly different circumstances. To operationalize
this shift, our proposed agenda bridges macro to micro. Guided by crash-rate
priors, generative scene engines, diverse driver models, and causal learning,
near-miss events are synthesized and explained. A crash-focused digital twin
testbed links micro scenes to macro patterns, while a multi-objective validator
ensures that simulations maintain statistical realism. This pipeline transforms
sparse crash data into rich signals for crash prediction, enabling the
stress-testing of vehicles, roads, and policies before deployment. By learning
from crashes that almost happened, we can shift traffic safety from reactive
forensics to proactive prevention, advancing Vision Zero.

Result: 双线性操作是状态跟踪任务的天然归纳偏置，且其复杂性层次中线性循环网络位于最低复杂度中心。

Conclusion: 隐藏单元的双线性操作在状态跟踪任务中具有重要作用，为网络行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is typically seen as
modeling memory, with research focusing on enhancing information retention
through gating mechanisms. A less explored perspective views hidden units as
active participants in the computation performed by the network, rather than
passive memory stores. In this work, we revisit bi-linear operations, which
involve multiplicative interactions between hidden units and input embeddings.
We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that they constitute a natural
inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state
tracking tasks. These are the simplest type of task that require hidden units
to actively contribute to the behavior of the network. We also show that
bi-linear state updates form a natural hierarchy corresponding to state
tracking tasks of increasing complexity, with popular linear recurrent networks
such as Mamba residing at the lowest-complexity center of that hierarchy.

Motivation: HRL中低层策略随时间变化，导致高层策略难以生成有效的子目标。需要一种方法既能捕捉复杂的子目标分布，又能量化不确定性。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，该方法在样本效率和性能上优于现有HRL方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合扩散模型和GP先验，有效解决了HRL中子目标生成的挑战，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) learns to make decisions on
multiple levels of temporal abstraction. A key challenge in HRL is that the
low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level
policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level
policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for
uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional
diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a
complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty
quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects
subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach
outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on
challenging continuous control benchmarks.

Abstract: Consider the following task taught in introductory optimization courses which
addresses challenges articulated by the community at the intersection of
(generative) AI and OR: generate the dual of a linear program. LLMs, being
trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal
to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably
expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this
expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for
generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of
DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing
evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives
and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal
interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure
accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct
duals. This finding holds even for the smallest two-variable instances and for
derivative tasks, such as correctness, verification, and error classification.
The paper also discusses the implications for educators, students, and the
development of large reasoning systems.

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing
and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the
classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of
training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or
unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading
to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used
in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of
diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored
in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory
retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong
memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction
around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the
critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where
an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new
attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples.
Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to
emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the
same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings
provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in
diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of
spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used
diffusion models.

Result: 在标准数据集（Cora、Citeseer、Pubmed）上，泊松方法在后期训练阶段表现优于传统的Dropout、DropEdge和DropNode方法。

Conclusion: 基于泊松的节点选择策略能有效缓解GNN的过平滑问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a major challenge in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
where repeated message passing causes node representations to converge and lose
discriminative power. To address this, we propose a novel node selection
strategy based on Poisson processes, introducing stochastic but structure-aware
updates. Specifically, we equip each node with an independent Poisson clock,
enabling asynchronous and localized updates that preserve structural diversity.
We explore two applications of this strategy: as a replacement for
dropout-based regularization and as a dynamic subgraph training scheme.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed)
demonstrate that our Poisson-based method yields competitive or improved
accuracy compared to traditional Dropout, DropEdge, and DropNode approaches,
particularly in later training stages.

Method: 通过检索和复制任务家族，结合C-RASP框架，研究预训练模型的长度泛化能力，并进行机制分析和实验验证。

Conclusion: 预训练选择性增强了Transformer的某些能力，但未解决其长度泛化的根本限制，实际任务中存在可靠性风险。

Abstract: Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain
sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations
play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively
overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models
themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural
constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of
$\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al.
[2024]. We use the recently proposed C-RASP framework for studying length
generalization [Huang et al., 2025b] to provide guarantees for each of our
settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$
asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right
(induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This
asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is
guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is
connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction
circuits within pretrained Transformers. We validate our findings through
practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our
results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain Transformer
capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.

Abstract: We design new differentially private algorithms for the problems of
adversarial bandits and bandits with expert advice. For adversarial bandits, we
give a simple and efficient conversion of any non-private bandit algorithm to a
private bandit algorithm. Instantiating our conversion with existing
non-private bandit algorithms gives a regret upper bound of
$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right)$, improving upon the existing
upper bound $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT \log(KT)}}{\epsilon}\right)$ for all
$\epsilon \leq 1$. In particular, our algorithms allow for sublinear expected
regret even when $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, establishing the first
known separation between central and local differential privacy for this
problem. For bandits with expert advice, we give the first differentially
private algorithms, with expected regret
$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{NT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right),
O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT\log(N)}\log(KT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, and
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{N^{1/6}K^{1/2}T^{2/3}\log(NT)}{\epsilon ^{1/3}} +
\frac{N^{1/2}\log(NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $K$ and $N$ are the number of
actions and experts respectively. These rates allow us to get sublinear regret
for different combinations of small and large $K, N$ and $\epsilon.$

Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) lies at the intersection of two pivotal
research areas: leveraging complementary information from multiple modalities
to improve downstream inference performance and enabling distributed training
to enhance efficiency and preserve privacy. Despite the growing interest in
MFL, there is currently no comprehensive taxonomy that organizes MFL through
the lens of different Federated Learning (FL) paradigms. This perspective is
important because multimodal data introduces distinct challenges across various
FL settings. These challenges, including modality heterogeneity, privacy
heterogeneity, and communication inefficiency, are fundamentally different from
those encountered in traditional unimodal or non-FL scenarios. In this paper,
we systematically examine MFL within the context of three major FL paradigms:
horizontal FL (HFL), vertical FL (VFL), and hybrid FL. For each paradigm, we
present the problem formulation, review representative training algorithms, and
highlight the most prominent challenge introduced by multimodal data in
distributed settings. We also discuss open challenges and provide insights for
future research. By establishing this taxonomy, we aim to uncover the novel
challenges posed by multimodal data from the perspective of different FL
paradigms and to offer a new lens through which to understand and advance the
development of MFL.

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs中真假命题的多维结构，概念锥是研究抽象行为的有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong conversational abilities but
often generate falsehoods. Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple
propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's
internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry.
In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for
modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones
that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our
results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions
reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones
generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions
preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer,
multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and
highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.

Abstract: Operational deployment of a fully automated greenhouse gas (GHG) plume
detection system remains an elusive goal for imaging spectroscopy missions,
despite recent advances in deep learning approaches. With the dramatic increase
in data availability, however, automation continues to increase in importance
for natural and anthropogenic emissions monitoring. This work reviews and
addresses several key obstacles in the field: data and label quality control,
prevention of spatiotemporal biases, and correctly aligned modeling objectives.
We demonstrate through rigorous experiments using multicampaign data from
airborne and spaceborne instruments that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are able to achieve operational detection performance when these obstacles are
alleviated. We demonstrate that a multitask model that learns both instance
detection and pixelwise segmentation simultaneously can successfully lead
towards an operational pathway. We evaluate the model's plume detectability
across emission source types and regions, identifying thresholds for
operational deployment. Finally, we provide analysis-ready data, models, and
source code for reproducibility, and work to define a set of best practices and
validation standards to facilitate future contributions to the field.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world
applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models
achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability.
On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain
under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new
approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement
learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data.
Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only
toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons
for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves
promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most
existing LLMs.

Abstract: Data Augmentation (DA) has become an essential tool to improve robustness and
generalization of modern machine learning. However, when deciding on DA
strategies it is critical to choose parameters carefully, and this can be a
daunting task which is traditionally left to trial-and-error or expensive
optimization based on validation performance. In this paper, we counter these
limitations by proposing a novel framework for optimizing DA. In particular, we
take a probabilistic view of DA, which leads to the interpretation of
augmentation parameters as model (hyper)-parameters, and the optimization of
the marginal likelihood with respect to these parameters as a Bayesian model
selection problem. Due to its intractability, we derive a tractable Evidence
Lower BOund (ELBO), which allows us to optimize augmentation parameters jointly
with model parameters. We provide extensive theoretical results on variational
approximation quality, generalization guarantees, invariance properties, and
connections to empirical Bayes. Through experiments on computer vision tasks,
we show that our approach improves calibration and yields robust performance
over fixed or no augmentation. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for
optimizing DA through Bayesian principles with significant potential for robust
machine learning.

Motivation: 全球2型糖尿病（T2DM）患病率迅速上升，带来巨大的健康和经济负担。早期识别高风险人群至关重要，但传统监督学习方法因缺乏确诊阴性病例而受限。

Method: 结合非负矩阵分解（NMF）与统计技术，从确诊患者的共病和用药模式中提取潜在特征，并应用于未确诊人群的风险评估。

Result: 该方法提供了一种可解释且可扩展的解决方案，有助于医疗提供者及时干预，改善患者预后。

Conclusion: 该无监督框架为T2DM的早期识别和干预提供了新思路，有望减轻未来的健康和经济负担。

Abstract: The global prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), is rapidly increasing, posing significant health and economic
challenges. T2DM not only disrupts blood glucose regulation but also damages
vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels,
leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. In the US alone, the economic
burden of diagnosed diabetes exceeded \$400 billion in 2022. Early detection of
individuals at risk is critical to mitigating these impacts. While machine
learning approaches for T2DM prediction are increasingly adopted, many rely on
supervised learning, which is often limited by the lack of confirmed negative
cases. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised framework
that integrates Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with statistical
techniques to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM. Our method
identifies latent patterns of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among diagnosed
T2DM patients and applies these patterns to estimate the T2DM risk in
undiagnosed individuals. By leveraging data-driven insights from comorbidity
and medication usage, our approach provides an interpretable and scalable
solution that can assist healthcare providers in implementing timely
interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and potentially reducing
the future health and economic burden of T2DM.

Abstract: Inference-time computation has emerged as a promising scaling axis for
improving large language model reasoning. However, despite yielding impressive
performance, the optimal allocation of inference-time computation remains
poorly understood. A central question is whether to prioritize sequential
scaling (e.g., longer chains of thought) or parallel scaling (e.g., majority
voting across multiple short chains of thought). In this work, we seek to
illuminate the landscape of test-time scaling by demonstrating the existence of
reasoning settings where sequential scaling offers an exponential advantage
over parallel scaling. These settings are based on graph connectivity problems
in challenging distributions of graphs. We validate our theoretical findings
with comprehensive experiments across a range of language models, including
models trained from scratch for graph connectivity with different chain of
thought strategies as well as large reasoning models.

Result: 带符号动量的方法比SGD快，但表现不如Adam；约束Adam动量参数相等的方法在性能和理论分析上表现优异。

Conclusion: 约束Adam动量参数相等的方法不仅性能稳健，还提供了新的理论视角和统计解释。

Abstract: Understanding the remarkable efficacy of Adam when training transformer-based
language models has become a central research topic within the optimization
community. To gain deeper insights, several simplifications of Adam have been
proposed, such as the signed gradient and signed momentum methods. In this
work, we conduct an extensive empirical study - training over 1,300 language
models across different data configurations and scales - comparing Adam to
several known simplified variants. We find that signed momentum methods are
faster than SGD, but consistently underperform relative to Adam, even after
careful tuning of momentum, clipping setting and learning rates. However, our
analysis reveals a compelling option that preserves near-optimal performance
while allowing for new insightful reformulations: constraining the Adam
momentum parameters to be equal. Beyond robust performance, this choice affords
new theoretical insights, highlights the "secret sauce" on top of signed
momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in
this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and
variance of gradients-one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational
inference perspective.

Motivation: 传统方法中，顺序进行微调和压缩会导致性能损失，并产生不必要的中间模型。

Method: 联合微调和压缩，逐步将模型蒸馏为修剪后的低秩结构。

Result: 实验表明，联合方法显著优于其他顺序压缩方法。

Conclusion: 直接联合微调与压缩是更高效的方法。

Abstract: To reduce model size during post-training, compression methods, including
knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and pruning, are often applied
after fine-tuning the model. However, sequential fine-tuning and compression
sacrifices performance, while creating a larger than necessary model as an
intermediate step. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap, by directly
constructing a smaller model while guided by the downstream task. We propose to
jointly fine-tune and compress the model by gradually distilling it to a pruned
low-rank structure. Experiments demonstrate that joint fine-tuning and
compression significantly outperforms other sequential compression methods.

Result: OMDPD实现了O(sqrt(K))的最优遗憾和强约束违反，且在奖励和转移估计准确时可进一步改进。

Conclusion: 该算法为对抗性环境中的安全决策提供了实用保证。

Abstract: Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in dynamic
environments, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and
cybersecurity. The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards
while satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision
processes (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic
constraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are
unknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper,
we propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the
first to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD
achieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K))
without relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe
policy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and
transitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical
guarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.

Conclusion: PLS实现了从学习到操作全过程的策略安全性，同时获得高奖励。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in safe reinforcement learning (RL) is a method to ensure
the safety of a policy throughout the entire process, from learning to
operation. However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve
this objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS),
that integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this
challenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned
supervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously
optimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian
processes (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the
mathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that
PLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high
probability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in
safety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to
obtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the
lifetime from learning to operation.

Conclusion: 这些方法为集成基础模型提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于未来更具挑战性的分类任务。

Abstract: We revisit the classical, full-fledged Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
paradigm to ensemble pre-trained and/or lightly-finetuned foundation models to
enhance the classification performance on image and text data. To make BMA
tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers
that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The
model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and
frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a
principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally
cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize
the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior
distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of
the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid
development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the
incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to
enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.

Motivation: 联邦学习中，由于数据在客户端节点间非独立同分布，标准批归一化（BN）的性能下降，亟需一种替代方案。

Method: 开发了混合批归一化（HBN），通过分离统计参数和可学习参数的更新，并引入混合分布因子，使每个节点能自适应地结合当前批次统计参数与全局统计参数。

Result: HBN在多种联邦学习场景中表现优异，尤其适用于小批次和异构数据。

Conclusion: HBN是一种有效的插件方法，显著提升了联邦学习的性能，尤其在数据异构和小批次场景下。

Abstract: Batch Normalisation (BN) is widely used in conventional deep neural network
training to harmonise the input-output distributions for each batch of data.
However, federated learning, a distributed learning paradigm, faces the
challenge of dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data
among the client nodes. Due to the lack of a coherent methodology for updating
BN statistical parameters, standard BN degrades the federated learning
performance. To this end, it is urgent to explore an alternative normalisation
solution for federated learning. In this work, we resolve the dilemma of the BN
layer in federated learning by developing a customised normalisation approach,
Hybrid Batch Normalisation (HBN). HBN separates the update of statistical
parameters (i.e. , means and variances used for evaluation) from that of
learnable parameters (i.e. , parameters that require gradient updates),
obtaining unbiased estimates of global statistical parameters in distributed
scenarios. In contrast with the existing solutions, we emphasise the supportive
power of global statistics for federated learning. The HBN layer introduces a
learnable hybrid distribution factor, allowing each computing node to
adaptively mix the statistical parameters of the current batch with the global
statistics. Our HBN can serve as a powerful plugin to advance federated
learning performance. It reflects promising merits across a wide range of
federated learning settings, especially for small batch sizes and heterogeneous
data.

Abstract: In tennis tournaments, momentum, a critical yet elusive phenomenon, reflects
the dynamic shifts in performance of athletes that can decisively influence
match outcomes. Despite its significance, momentum in terms of effective
modeling and multi-granularity analysis across points, games, sets, and matches
in tennis tournaments remains underexplored. In this study, we define a novel
Momentum Score (MS) metric to quantify a player's momentum level in
multi-granularity tennis tournaments, and design HydraNet, a momentum-driven
state-space duality-based framework, to model MS by integrating thirty-two
heterogeneous dimensions of athletes performance in serve, return, psychology
and fatigue. HydraNet integrates a Hydra module, which builds upon a
state-space duality (SSD) framework, capturing explicit momentum with a
sliding-window mechanism and implicit momentum through cross-game state
propagation. It also introduces a novel Versus Learning method to better
enhance the adversarial nature of momentum between the two athletes at a macro
level, along with a Collaborative-Adversarial Attention Mechanism (CAAM) for
capturing and integrating intra-player and inter-player dynamic momentum at a
micro level. Additionally, we construct a million-level tennis cross-tournament
dataset spanning from 2012-2023 Wimbledon and 2013-2023 US Open, and validate
the multi-granularity modeling capability of HydraNet for the MS metric on this
dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the MS metric
constructed by the HydraNet framework provides actionable insights into how
momentum impacts outcomes at different granularities, establishing a new
foundation for momentum modeling and sports analysis. To the best of our
knowledge. The source code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出两种改进扩散模型偏好学习的方法：DPO-C&M和SDPO，解决了现有方法的不稳定性和策略偏差问题，实验证明其优于标准Diffusion-DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型偏好学习方法（如Diffusion-DPO）存在时间步依赖的不稳定性和策略偏差问题，影响了模型性能。

Method: 1. DPO-C&M：通过裁剪和掩蔽无信息时间步提高稳定性；2. SDPO：引入重要性采样以完全纠正策略偏差并强调信息性更新。

Result: 在多个模型（CogVideoX-2B、CogVideoX-5B、Wan2.1-1.3B）上实验，SDPO在VBench评分、人类偏好对齐和训练鲁棒性上表现最优。

Conclusion: 时间步感知和分布校正优化对扩散模型偏好学习至关重要，SDPO为当前最佳方法。

Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative
models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion
models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However,
existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges:
timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and
forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy
timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization
and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion
trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps
with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose
DPO-C\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking
uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on
this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a
principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective
to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during
the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and
Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO,
with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and
training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware,
distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在量化后的LoRA适配器中应用正弦变换以保持性能的方法，验证了其在语言、视觉和文本生成任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的低秩约束限制了表示能力，导致性能不如全秩微调。研究旨在探索正弦变换是否能在量化后仍保持性能提升。

Method: 将正弦变换框架扩展到量化LoRA适配器，并进行理论分析，证明量化适配器的稳定秩与其全精度版本紧密相关。

Result: 实验表明，正弦非线性带来的表达能力提升在量化后依然存在，实现了高压缩适配器且性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种任务中验证了其有效性，显著节省内存同时保持竞争力。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering substantial reductions in trainable
parameters by modeling updates as the product of two low-rank matrices. While
effective, the low-rank constraint inherently limits representational capacity,
often resulting in reduced performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning.
Recent work by Ji et al. (2025) has addressed this limitation by applying a
fixed-frequency sinusoidal transformation to low-rank adapters, increasing
their stable rank without introducing additional parameters. This raises a
crucial question: can the same sine-activated technique be successfully applied
within the context of Post-Training Quantization to retain benefits even after
model compression? In this paper, we investigate this question by extending the
sinusoidal transformation framework to quantized LoRA adapters. We develop a
theoretical analysis showing that the stable rank of a quantized adapter is
tightly linked to that of its full-precision counterpart, motivating the use of
such rank-enhancing functions even under quantization. Our results demonstrate
that the expressivity gains from a sinusoidal non-linearity persist after
quantization, yielding highly compressed adapters with negligible loss in
performance. We validate our approach across a range of fine-tuning tasks for
language, vision and text-to-image generation achieving significant memory
savings while maintaining competitive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRG编码对医院运营至关重要，但传统方法依赖人工且数据分布外问题导致大语言模型难以处理。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B模型，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和规则奖励进行强化学习训练。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV基准测试中达到最优准确率，并提供医生验证的解释性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，强化学习在知识密集型任务中的性能受基础模型知识限制，扩展监督微调比单独扩展强化学习更有效。

Abstract: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement
and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of
the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data.
We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL)
for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards,
DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific
challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates
physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing
explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying
RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales
approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally
constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks
like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion
prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and
computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的优化策略解决了Transformer训练中的谱能量集中问题，为大规模训练提供了稳定方案。

Abstract: Scaling Transformer to a large scale without using some technical tricks such
as learning rate warump and using an obviously lower learning rate is an
extremely challenging task, and is increasingly gaining more attention. In this
paper, we provide a theoretical analysis for the process of training
Transformer and reveal the rationale behind the model crash phenomenon in the
training process, termed \textit{spectral energy concentration} of
${\bW_q}^{\top} \bW_k$, which is the reason for a malignant entropy collapse,
where ${\bW_q}$ and $\bW_k$ are the projection matrices for the query and the
key in Transformer, respectively. To remedy this problem, motivated by
\textit{Weyl's Inequality}, we present a novel optimization strategy, \ie,
making the weight updating in successive steps smooth -- if the ratio
$\frac{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}$ is larger than a
threshold, we will automatically bound the learning rate to a weighted multiple
of $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}$, where $\nabla
\bW_t$ is the updating quantity in step $t$. Such an optimization strategy can
prevent spectral energy concentration to only a few directions, and thus can
avoid malignant entropy collapse which will trigger the model crash. We conduct
extensive experiments using ViT, Swin-Transformer and GPT, showing that our
optimization strategy can effectively and stably train these Transformers
without using learning rate warmup.

performance on the downstream task of human activity recognition. While this
task can be addressed using a vanilla Transformer, we propose an enhanced
n-dimensional numerical processing Transformer that incorporates three key
features: embedding n-dimensional numerical data through a linear layer,
binning-based pre-processing, and a linear transformation in the output layer.
We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed model across five different
datasets. Compared to the vanilla Transformer, our model demonstrated 10%-15%
improvements in accuracy.

Conclusion: FALCON为模拟电路设计提供了一个实用且可扩展的端到端自动化基础模型。

Abstract: Designing analog circuits from performance specifications is a complex,
multi-stage process encompassing topology selection, parameter inference, and
layout feasibility. We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework
that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis
through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target
performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a
performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it
employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit
topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter
inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a
differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing
parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We
train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave
circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20
expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99\%
accuracy in topology inference, <10\% relative error in performance prediction,
and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per
instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible
foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.

Abstract: This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to
multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are
efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets
of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to
design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to
use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per
task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$
groups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one
adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the
ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of
low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset
combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we
use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during
fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\%$ error
on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true
fine-tuning performances under $5\%$ error while speeding up computation
compared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama
and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to
$10\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\%$ more FLOPs. On
a Llama model with $34$ billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test
accuracy by $3\%$ compared to QLoRA, with only $8\%$ more FLOPs.

Method: 设计了高效的攻击策略，明确考虑奖励值的幅度约束和注入数据的时间约束。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，攻击能有效误导UCB和Thompson Sampling算法，以次线性攻击成本实现目标臂的选择。

Conclusion: 揭示了广泛使用的随机老虎机算法在实际对抗场景中的显著脆弱性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some
unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded
perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a
more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic
adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of
bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate
interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model,
explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and
temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our
theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in
nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies,
revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit
algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.

Result: SPARC在Seq-TinyImageNet上表现优异，与其他基于回放的方法在多个持续学习基准上表现相当，且参数效率显著。

Conclusion: SPARC是一种高效、可扩展的持续学习解决方案，适用于严格效率约束的场景。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has remained a significant challenge for deep neural
networks as learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge, either
partially or completely. Existing solutions often rely on experience rehearsal
or full model surrogates to mitigate CF. While effective, these approaches
introduce substantial memory and computational overhead, limiting their
scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose SPARC, a scalable CL approach that eliminates the need for experience
rehearsal and full-model surrogates. By effectively combining task-specific
working memories and task-agnostic semantic memory for cross-task knowledge
consolidation, SPARC results in a remarkable parameter efficiency, using only
6% of the parameters required by full-model surrogates. Despite its lightweight
design, SPARC achieves superior performance on Seq-TinyImageNet and matches
rehearsal-based methods on various CL benchmarks. Additionally, weight
re-normalization in the classification layer mitigates task-specific biases,
establishing SPARC as a practical and scalable solution for CL under stringent
efficiency constraints.

Conclusion: 该研究推动了TPAUC优化的前沿，并为实际机器学习应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Two-way partial AUC (TPAUC) is a critical performance metric for binary
classification with imbalanced data, as it focuses on specific ranges of the
true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). However, stochastic
algorithms for TPAUC optimization remain under-explored, with existing methods
either limited to approximated TPAUC loss functions or burdened by sub-optimal
complexities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two innovative
stochastic primal-dual double block-coordinate algorithms for TPAUC
maximization. These algorithms utilize stochastic block-coordinate updates for
both the primal and dual variables, catering to both convex and non-convex
settings. We provide theoretical convergence rate analyses, demonstrating
significant improvements over prior approaches. Our experimental results, based
on multiple benchmark datasets, validate the superior performance of our
algorithms, showcasing faster convergence and better generalization. This work
advances the state of the art in TPAUC optimization and offers practical tools
for real-world machine learning applications.

Conclusion: EnsemW2S方法在弱到强泛化问题上表现出色，为监督强大模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially
surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop
approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful
models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We
address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by
proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the
same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex,
super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a
token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts,
systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations.
By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their
collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively
evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts
and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question
difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our
empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\%
improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for
experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our
proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在使用LLM作为评委时，需更全面地量化不确定性，贝叶斯推断为此提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs)
is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common
practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of
this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework
that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex
can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges.
Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking
identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable
even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become
non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data,
absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how
uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e.,
inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding
which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until
now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to
encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking
estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings
and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the
importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification
when using LLMs as judges.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an efficient pipeline for optimizing
black-box functions with the help of a Gaussian process prior and an
acquisition function (AF). Recently, in the context of single-objective BO,
learning-based AFs witnessed promising empirical results given its favorable
non-myopic nature. Despite this, the direct extension of these approaches to
multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) suffer from the
\textit{hypervolume identifiability issue}, which results from the
non-Markovian nature of MOBO problems. To tackle this, inspired by the
non-Markovian RL literature and the success of Transformers in language
modeling, we present a generalized deep Q-learning framework and propose
\textit{BOFormer}, which substantiates this framework for MOBO via sequence
modeling. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BOFormer constantly
outperforms the benchmark rule-based and learning-based algorithms in various
synthetic MOBO and real-world multi-objective hyperparameter optimization
problems. We have made the source code publicly available to encourage further
research in this direction.

generating meaningful new features. Traditional feature generation methods
heavily rely on domain expertise and manual intervention, making the process
labor-intensive and challenging to adapt to different scenarios. Although
automated feature generation techniques address these issues to some extent,
they often face challenges such as feature redundancy, inefficiency in feature
space exploration, and limited adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. To
address these problems, we propose a Two-Stage Feature Generation (TSFG)
framework, which integrates a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture
with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The encoder-decoder model in TSFG
leverages the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to efficiently represent
and transform features, capturing complex dependencies within the data. PPO
further enhances TSFG by dynamically adjusting the feature generation strategy
based on task-specific feedback, optimizing the process for improved
performance and adaptability. TSFG dynamically generates high-quality feature
sets, significantly improving the predictive performance of machine learning
models. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of feature quality and adaptability.

*Zhendong Mi,Zhenglun Kong,Geng Yuan,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效且有效的大型语言模型剪枝方法，通过激活余弦相似度损失和激活方差引导的剪枝指标，显著提升了剪枝性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速扩展，对内存和计算资源的需求大幅增加。现有剪枝方法在性能或效率上存在不足，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 引入两种创新剪枝指标：1) 激活余弦相似度损失引导的剪枝指标，考虑密集模型与剪枝模型输出激活的角度偏差；2) 激活方差引导的剪枝指标，保留剪枝后输出激活的语义区分性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LLaMA、LLaMA-2和OPT等模型上实现了困惑度降低18%和剪枝时间减少63%。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率上均显著提升了大型语言模型的剪枝效果。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for
memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in
LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models.
However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning
performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we
propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves
high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration
efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation
cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular
deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An
activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic
distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning
with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to
enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show
that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63%
decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种近似归一化方法anTransformer，通过约束参数范数和标量乘法归一化表示，提升了GPT训练的收敛速度，同时保持了经典GPT架构的扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中的正则化和归一化问题，如过拟合和数值不稳定性，同时提高收敛速度。

Method: 提出anTransformer方法，约束参数范数并通过标量乘法归一化表示，利用高维随机向量范数的紧致性。

Result: 在GPT训练中，收敛速度比QK归一化快40%，额外运行时开销小于3%，支持更大批次和更少超参数训练。

Conclusion: anTransformer是一种高效且近似的方法，能够在不牺牲扩展性的情况下加速训练并减少超参数需求。

Abstract: In deep learning, regularization and normalization are common solutions for
challenges such as overfitting, numerical instabilities, and the increasing
variance in the residual stream. An alternative approach is to force all
parameters and representations to lie on a hypersphere. This removes the need
for regularization and increases convergence speed, but comes with additional
costs. In this work, we propose a more holistic but approximate normalization
(anTransformer). Our approach constrains the norm of parameters and normalizes
all representations via scalar multiplications motivated by the tight
concentration of the norms of high-dimensional random vectors. When applied to
GPT training, we observe a 40% faster convergence compared to models with QK
normalization, with less than 3% additional runtime. Deriving scaling laws for
anGPT, we found our method enables training with larger batch sizes and fewer
hyperparameters, while matching the favorable scaling characteristics of
classic GPT architectures.

*Zi-Hao Zhou,Jun-Jie Wang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于连续语义相似度的弱监督对比学习框架，解决了传统监督对比学习在标签模糊或不准确时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，数据标注往往模糊或不准确，限制了监督对比学习的应用。

Method: 通过连续语义相似度定义正负样本对，并基于图论框架实现弱监督对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在噪声标签和部分标签学习场景中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论上能够逼近监督对比学习的效果，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success in learning effective
representations, with supervised contrastive learning often outperforming
self-supervised approaches. However, in real-world scenarios, data annotations
are often ambiguous or inaccurate, meaning that class labels may not reliably
indicate whether two examples belong to the same class. This limitation
restricts the applicability of supervised contrastive learning. To address this
challenge, we introduce the concept of ``continuous semantic similarity'' to
define positive and negative pairs. Instead of directly relying on imprecise
class labels, we measure the semantic similarity between example pairs, which
quantifies how closely they belong to the same category by iteratively refining
weak supervisory signals. Based on this concept, we propose a graph-theoretic
framework for weakly-supervised contrastive learning, where semantic similarity
serves as the graph weights. Our framework is highly versatile and can be
applied to many weakly-supervised learning scenarios. We demonstrate its
effectiveness through experiments in two common settings, i.e., noisy label and
partial label learning, where existing methods can be easily integrated to
significantly improve performance. Theoretically, we establish an error bound
for our approach, showing that it can approximate supervised contrastive
learning under mild conditions. The implementation code is available at
https://github.com/Speechless-10308/WSC.

*Michael Grohs,Adrian Rebmann,Jana-Rebecca Rehse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，用于检测流程中的不良行为，无需专用流程模型或资源密集型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖流程模型或资源密集型微调，且微调后的模型泛化能力差。

Method: 使用RAG为LLM提供知识库访问，直接利用其他流程中的行为知识。

Result: 评估表明，该方法在检测不良行为上优于微调LLM。

Conclusion: RAG是资源密集型微调的有效替代方案，尤其在结合事件日志上下文时。

Abstract: Conformance checking techniques detect undesired process behavior by
comparing process executions that are recorded in event logs to desired
behavior that is captured in a dedicated process model. If such models are not
available, conformance checking techniques are not applicable, but
organizations might still be interested in detecting undesired behavior in
their processes. To enable this, existing approaches use Large Language Models
(LLMs), assuming that they can learn to distinguish desired from undesired
behavior through fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive
and the fine-tuned LLMs often do not generalize well. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that requires neither a dedicated process
model nor resource-intensive fine-tuning to detect undesired process behavior.
Instead, we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide an LLM with
direct access to a knowledge base that contains both desired and undesired
process behavior from other processes, assuming that the LLM can transfer this
knowledge to the process at hand. Our evaluation shows that our approach
outperforms fine-tuned LLMs in detecting undesired behavior, demonstrating that
RAG is a viable alternative to resource-intensive fine-tuning, particularly
when enriched with relevant context from the event log, such as frequent traces
and activities.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练样本顺序对大型语言模型（LLMs）性能和学习动态的影响，传统方法因计算成本高而不可行。

Method: 设计了一个基于一阶和二阶泰勒展开近似Adam优化器更新的框架，结合随机投影方法存储中间检查点。

Result: 框架能高效估计模型参数，验证了其在课程设计和记忆/泛化分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化LLM训练课程和分析其学习动态提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The order of training samples plays a crucial role in large language models
(LLMs), significantly impacting both their external performance and internal
learning dynamics. Traditional methods for investigating this effect generally
require retraining the model with various sample orders, which is
computationally infeasible for LLMs. In this work, we improve traditional
methods by designing a retraining-free framework. By approximating Adam
optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing
random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can
efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders.
Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training
curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose
a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with
estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2)
LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our
retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples
influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct
extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free
framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate
its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the
memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Optimal Transport（OT）在机器学习中广泛应用，但其计算复杂度高，切片方法如min-SWGG虽能提升效率，但仍存在维度爆炸和线性投影限制的问题。

Method: 将min-SWGG重新表述为双层优化问题，提出可微分近似方案以高效识别最优切片，并扩展至流形数据。

Result: 该方法在高维和流形数据中表现优异，适用于梯度流和图像生成等应用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了OT在高维和流形数据中的计算效率，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine
learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances
between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but
also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a
bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to
large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a
single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space,
finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an
approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical
advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the
number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii)
it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a
bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme
to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings.
We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data
living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our
approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and
high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow
matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is
essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ReLU因其简单性和稀疏性仍受欢迎，但其‘死亡’问题限制了其有效性。本文旨在通过改进ReLU的梯度处理，提升其性能。

Method: 提出SUGAR方法，保留ReLU的前向传播特性，但在反向传播中使用平滑的替代梯度以避免梯度消失。

Result: SUGAR在VGG-16、ResNet-18等架构中显著提升了泛化性能，并在现代架构中表现优于GELU。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适当的梯度处理，传统ReLU仍可在多种深度学习模型中表现出色，挑战了先进激活函数必要的观点。

Abstract: Modeling sophisticated activation functions within deep learning
architectures has evolved into a distinct research direction. Functions such as
GELU, SELU, and SiLU offer smooth gradients and improved convergence
properties, making them popular choices in state-of-the-art models. Despite
this trend, the classical ReLU remains appealing due to its simplicity,
inherent sparsity, and other advantageous topological characteristics. However,
ReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as
the dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this
work, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel,
plug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard
ReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the
backward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We
demonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function,
substantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network
architectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while
effectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern
architectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU
- substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior
performance. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that advanced
activation functions are necessary for optimal performance. Instead, they
suggest that the conventional ReLU, particularly with appropriate gradient
handling, can serve as a strong, versatile revived classic across a broad range
of deep learning vision models.

Method: 通过合成数据集定量评估Transformer的记忆偏差，并进行理论分析，探讨测试时策略（如提供额外信息）的效果。

Result: 实验表明，测试时提供额外信息可显著减轻记忆偏差，但减轻偏差不一定提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了NSR方法的局限性，为设计更鲁棒的符号回归方法提供了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical equations that fit given
numerical data. It has been applied in various fields of scientific research,
such as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena.
Recently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers
pre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While
these methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from
low performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In
this study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization
bias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative
evaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found
that Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data.
Additional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the
Transformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while
verifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time
strategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We
empirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at
test time can significantly mitigate memorization bias. On the other hand, we
also find that reducing memorization bias does not necessarily correlate with
improved performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the limitations of NSR approaches and offer a foundation for designing more
robust, generalizable symbolic regression methods. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公共数据集上比传统联邦学习提升15%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为全球医疗中的联邦学习提供了隐私、合规性和性能的平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI
models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world
adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints,
and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply
uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among
well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware
FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on
quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance
scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure,
inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating
under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions
yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work
advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a
viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.

Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph
representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact
key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce
GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying
sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal
Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and
leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with
the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on
Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both
graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and
molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training,
applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and
regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing,
matching, and prediction.

Conclusion: BiMi Sheets有望促进偏置缓解方法的标准化和广泛应用。

Abstract: Over the past 15 years, hundreds of bias mitigation methods have been
proposed in the pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML). However,
algorithmic biases are domain-, task-, and model-specific, leading to a
`portability trap': bias mitigation solutions in one context may not be
appropriate in another. Thus, a myriad of design choices have to be made when
creating a bias mitigation method, such as the formalization of fairness it
pursues, and where and how it intervenes in the ML pipeline. This creates
challenges in benchmarking and comparing the relative merits of different bias
mitigation methods, and limits their uptake by practitioners.
  We propose BiMi Sheets as a portable, uniform guide to document the design
choices of any bias mitigation method. This enables researchers and
practitioners to quickly learn its main characteristics and to compare with
their desiderata. Furthermore, the sheets' structure allow for the creation of
a structured database of bias mitigation methods. In order to foster the
sheets' adoption, we provide a platform for finding and creating BiMi Sheets at

Abstract: A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is
achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments.
In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL
to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed
retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of
implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline
auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex
coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy
trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior
works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and
continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves
state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets,
outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust
generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we
introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline
MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such
settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code
available upon publication.

Conclusion: 联合考虑所有节点表示是异质性图上不确定性估计的关键设计原则，该方法无需显式利用同质性即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: While uncertainty estimation for graphs recently gained traction, most
methods rely on homophily and deteriorate in heterophilic settings. We address
this by analyzing message passing neural networks from an information-theoretic
perspective and developing a suitable analog to data processing inequality to
quantify information throughout the model's layers. In contrast to non-graph
domains, information about the node-level prediction target can increase with
model depth if a node's features are semantically different from its neighbors.
Therefore, on heterophilic graphs, the latent embeddings of an MPNN each
provide different information about the data distribution - different from
homophilic settings. This reveals that considering all node representations
simultaneously is a key design principle for epistemic uncertainty estimation
on graphs beyond homophily. We empirically confirm this with a simple post-hoc
density estimator on the joint node embedding space that provides
state-of-the-art uncertainty on heterophilic graphs. At the same time, it
matches prior work on homophilic graphs without explicitly exploiting homophily
through post-processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度深度学习的快速发展暴露了对其理论局限性的需求，尤其是在梯度信息不足时，方法需要大量迭代才能成功。

Method: 通过测量目标函数类的成对独立性和输入分布的碰撞熵，提出了梯度方差的一般性界限。

Result: 界限表示为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon+e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}_c})$，并应用于LWE映射和高频函数。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了理论分析，还通过实验验证了深度学习攻击LWE的性质。

Abstract: In the past decade gradient-based deep learning has revolutionized several
applications. However, this rapid advancement has highlighted the need for a
deeper theoretical understanding of its limitations. Research has shown that,
in many practical learning tasks, the information contained in the gradient is
so minimal that gradient-based methods require an exceedingly large number of
iterations to achieve success. The informativeness of the gradient is typically
measured by its variance with respect to the random selection of a target
function from a hypothesis class.
  We use this framework and give a general bound on the variance in terms of a
parameter related to the pairwise independence of the target function class and
the collision entropy of the input distribution. Our bound scales as $
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon+e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}_c}) $, where $
\tilde{\mathcal{O}} $ hides factors related to the regularity of the learning
model and the loss function, $ \varepsilon $ measures the pairwise independence
of the target function class and $\mathcal{E}_c$ is the collision entropy of
the input distribution.
  To demonstrate the practical utility of our bound, we apply it to the class
of Learning with Errors (LWE) mappings and high-frequency functions. In
addition to the theoretical analysis, we present experiments to understand
better the nature of recent deep learning-based attacks on LWE.

machine learning and computer vision to learn meaningful representations from
unlabeled data. Meanwhile, its empirical success has encouraged many
theoretical studies to reveal the learning mechanisms. However, in the existing
theoretical research, the role of data augmentation is still under-exploited,
especially the effects of specific augmentation types. To fill in the blank, we
for the first time propose an augmentation-aware error bound for
self-supervised contrastive learning, showing that the supervised risk is
bounded not only by the unsupervised risk, but also explicitly by a trade-off
induced by data augmentation. Then, under a novel semantic label assumption, we
discuss how certain augmentation methods affect the error bound. Lastly, we
conduct both pixel- and representation-level experiments to verify our proposed
theoretical results.

Conclusion: BNDL通过贝叶斯非负因子分析有效解决了深度神经网络的不确定性估计和可解释性问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的模型。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have demonstrated significant success due to
their powerful expressiveness, most models struggle to meet practical
requirements for uncertainty estimation. Concurrently, the entangled nature of
deep neural networks leads to a multifaceted problem, where various localized
explanation techniques reveal that multiple unrelated features influence the
decisions, thereby undermining interpretability. To address these challenges,
we develop a Bayesian Non-negative Decision Layer (BNDL), which reformulates
deep neural networks as a conditional Bayesian non-negative factor analysis. By
leveraging stochastic latent variables, the BNDL can model complex dependencies
and provide robust uncertainty estimation. Moreover, the sparsity and
non-negativity of the latent variables encourage the model to learn
disentangled representations and decision layers, thereby improving
interpretability. We also offer theoretical guarantees that BNDL can achieve
effective disentangled learning. In addition, we developed a corresponding
variational inference method utilizing a Weibull variational inference network
to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Our
experimental results demonstrate that with enhanced disentanglement
capabilities, BNDL not only improves the model's accuracy but also provides
reliable uncertainty estimation and improved interpretability.

Motivation: 研究验证器的可靠性及其对强化学习训练的影响，以数学推理为例，揭示现有验证器的局限性。

Result: 规则验证器对等效答案格式不敏感，模型验证器易被攻击导致虚假奖励。

Conclusion: 验证器的局限性需关注，以开发更稳健的奖励系统。

Abstract: Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning
with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like
mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in
previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of
these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly
understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and
conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation
and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based
verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different
formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in
non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL
training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets
stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential
solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that
model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy,
further analysis and RL training results imply that they are highly susceptible
to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct
(i.e., false positives). This vulnerability is exploited during policy model
optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore
the unique risks inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers, aiming
to offer valuable insights to develop more robust reward systems in
reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NNP在计算材料科学中替代DFT计算，但预训练和微调方法计算成本高，主要因DFT标注和大规模预训练中的负载不平衡。

Method: 提出LaMM方法，结合改进的去噪自监督学习和负载均衡算法，用于高效多节点训练。

Result: 利用3亿半标记样本训练单一NNP模型，显著提升了微调的速度和准确性。

Conclusion: LaMM方法有效解决了NNP训练中的计算成本和负载不平衡问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) are crucial for accelerating computational
materials science by surrogating density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Improving their accuracy is possible through pre-training and fine-tuning,
where an NNP model is first pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and then
fine-tuned on a smaller target dataset. However, this approach is
computationally expensive, mainly due to the cost of DFT-based dataset labeling
and load imbalances during large-scale pre-training. To address this, we
propose LaMM, a semi-supervised pre-training method incorporating improved
denoising self-supervised learning and a load-balancing algorithm for efficient
multi-node training. We demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages a
large-scale dataset of $\sim$300 million semi-labeled samples to train a single
NNP model, resulting in improved fine-tuning performance in terms of both speed
and accuracy.

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is a fundamental tool for decision-making in a wide
range of applications. However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of
the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from
contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a
machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make
decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning
(DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce
predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy.
While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving
the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation.
In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization
problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world
applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the
geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with
minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight
that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that
is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope.
Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth
optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this
as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.

Conclusion: 该方法在核基估计中提供了有效的紧致不确定性界限，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Non-conservative uncertainty bounds are key for both assessing an estimation
algorithm's accuracy and in view of downstream tasks, such as its deployment in
safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we derive a tight, non-asymptotic
uncertainty bound for kernel-based estimation, which can also handle correlated
noise sequences. Its computation relies on a mild norm-boundedness assumption
on the unknown function and the noise, returning the worst-case function
realization within the hypothesis class at an arbitrary query input location.
The value of this function is shown to be given in terms of the posterior mean
and covariance of a Gaussian process for an optimal choice of the measurement
noise covariance. By rigorously analyzing the proposed approach and comparing
it with other results in the literature, we show its effectiveness in returning
tight and easy-to-compute bounds for kernel-based estimates.

Through a comprehensive evaluation using B-XAIC, we reveal limitations of

Abstract: Co-branding has become a vital strategy for businesses aiming to expand
market reach within recommendation systems. However, identifying effective
cross-industry partnerships remains challenging due to resource imbalances,
uncertain brand willingness, and ever-changing market conditions. In this
paper, we provide the first systematic study of this problem and propose a
unified online-offline framework to enable co-branding recommendations. Our
approach begins by constructing a bipartite graph linking ``initiating'' and
``target'' brands to quantify co-branding probabilities and assess market
benefits. During the online learning phase, we dynamically update the graph in
response to market feedback, while striking a balance between exploring new
collaborations for long-term gains and exploiting established partnerships for
immediate benefits. To address the high initial co-branding costs, our
framework mitigates redundant exploration, thereby enhancing short-term
performance while ensuring sustainable strategic growth. In the offline
optimization phase, our framework consolidates the interests of multiple
sub-brands under the same parent brand to maximize overall returns, avoid
excessive investment in single sub-brands, and reduce unnecessary costs
associated with over-prioritizing a single sub-brand. We present a theoretical
analysis of our approach, establishing a highly nontrivial sublinear regret
bound for online learning in the complex co-branding problem, and enhancing the
approximation guarantee for the NP-hard offline budget allocation optimization.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world co-branding datasets demonstrate
the practical effectiveness of our framework, with at least 12\% improvement.

Result: KronSAE显著减少了计算和内存需求，同时mAND激活函数提高了模型的解释性和性能。

Conclusion: KronSAE和mAND为大规模稀疏自编码器的训练提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated significant promise in
interpreting the hidden states of language models by decomposing them into
interpretable latent directions. However, training SAEs at scale remains
challenging, especially when large dictionary sizes are used. While decoders
can leverage sparse-aware kernels for efficiency, encoders still require
computationally intensive linear operations with large output dimensions. To
address this, we propose KronSAE, a novel architecture that factorizes the
latent representation via Kronecker product decomposition, drastically reducing
memory and computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce mAND, a
differentiable activation function approximating the binary AND operation,
which improves interpretability and performance in our factorized framework.

Result: off-policy GRPO在奖励表现上显著优于或与on-policy GRPO相当。

Conclusion: 研究支持在off-policy版本中使用裁剪替代目标，并验证了off-policy GRPO的优越性。

Abstract: We revisit Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in both on-policy and
off-policy optimization regimes. Our motivation comes from recent work on
off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which improves training
stability, sampling efficiency, and memory usage. In addition, a recent
analysis of GRPO suggests that estimating the advantage function with
off-policy samples could be beneficial. Building on these observations, we
adapt GRPO to the off-policy setting. We show that both on-policy and
off-policy GRPO objectives yield an improvement in the reward. This result
motivates the use of clipped surrogate objectives in the off-policy version of
GRPO. We then compare the empirical performance of reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards in post-training using both GRPO variants. Our results show
that off-policy GRPO either significantly outperforms or performs on par with
its on-policy counterpart.

Abstract: Novel techniques in evolutionary optimization, simulation and machine
learning allow for a broad analysis of domains like fluid dynamics, in which
computation is expensive and flow behavior is complex. Under the term of full
domain analysis we understand the ability to efficiently determine the full
space of solutions in a problem domain, and analyze the behavior of those
solutions in an accessible and interactive manner. The goal of full domain
analysis is to deepen our understanding of domains by generating many examples
of flow, their diversification, optimization and analysis. We define a formal
model for full domain analysis, its current state of the art, and requirements
of subcomponents. Finally, an example is given to show what we can learn by
using full domain analysis. Full domain analysis, rooted in optimization and
machine learning, can be a helpful tool in understanding complex systems in

Abstract: Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG),
electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated
and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system.
However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by
diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened
invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion
transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded
signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a
specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in
generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying
modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular
signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal
denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the
performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and
estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability
for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue
for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.

Conclusion: 合成数据可以分离知识获取与推理过程，有望提升模型的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Pretraining on large, semantically rich datasets is key for developing
language models. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that even synthetic
data, generated procedurally through simple semantic-free algorithms, can yield
some of the same benefits as natural language pretraining. It is unclear what
specific capabilities such simple synthetic data instils in a model, where
these capabilities reside in the architecture, and how they manifest within its
weights. In this short paper, we identify several beneficial forms of
procedural data, together with specific algorithmic reasoning skills that
improve in small transformers. Our core finding is that different procedural
rules instil distinct but complementary inductive structures in the model. With
extensive ablations and partial-transfer experiments, we discover that these
structures reside in different parts of the model. Attention layers often carry
the most transferable information, but some pretraining rules impart useful
structure to MLP blocks instead. Most interestingly, the structures induced by
multiple rules can be composed to jointly reinforce multiple capabilities.
These results suggest an exciting possibility of disentangling the acquisition
of knowledge from reasoning in language models, with the goal of improving
their robustness and data efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出基于权重空间特性的新方法，显著提升抵抗重新学习攻击的能力，达到当前最优水平。

Abstract: Recent unlearning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to relearning attacks:
knowledge believed-to-be-unlearned re-emerges by fine-tuning on a small set of
(even seemingly-unrelated) examples. We study this phenomenon in a controlled
setting for example-level unlearning in vision classifiers. We make the
surprising discovery that forget-set accuracy can recover from around 50%
post-unlearning to nearly 100% with fine-tuning on just the retain set -- i.e.,
zero examples of the forget set. We observe this effect across a wide variety
of unlearning methods, whereas for a model retrained from scratch excluding the
forget set (gold standard), the accuracy remains at 50%. We observe that
resistance to relearning attacks can be predicted by weight-space properties,
specifically, $L_2$-distance and linear mode connectivity between the original
and the unlearned model. Leveraging this insight, we propose a new class of
methods that achieve state-of-the-art resistance to relearning attacks.

perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training

investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting
entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is
critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully
open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPS模型评估方法存在两个主要问题：一是将模拟视为预测问题，无法准确评估模型对当前流程的捕捉能力；二是依赖基于Earth Mover's Distance的指标，可能掩盖时间模式。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过评估模拟数据在下游分析任务（如预测性流程监控）中的表现，来判断模拟质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架不仅能识别差异来源，还能区分模型准确性和数据复杂性，提供更有效的BPS质量评估方法。

Conclusion: 新框架为BPS模型评估提供了更准确和实用的方法，有助于优化业务流程模拟的可靠性。

Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a key tool for analyzing and optimizing
organizational workflows, supporting decision-making by estimating the impact
of process changes. The reliability of such estimates depends on the ability of
a BPS model to accurately mimic the process under analysis, making rigorous
accuracy evaluation essential. However, the state-of-the-art approach to
evaluating BPS models has two key limitations. First, it treats simulation as a
forecasting problem, testing whether models can predict unseen future events.
This fails to assess how well a model captures the as-is process, particularly
when process behavior changes from train to test period. Thus, it becomes
difficult to determine whether poor results stem from an inaccurate model or
the inherent complexity of the data, such as unpredictable drift. Second, the
evaluation approach strongly relies on Earth Mover's Distance-based metrics,
which can obscure temporal patterns and thus yield misleading conclusions about
simulation quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that
evaluates simulation quality based on its ability to generate representative
process behavior. Instead of comparing simulated logs to future real-world
executions, we evaluate whether predictive process monitoring models trained on
simulated data perform comparably to those trained on real data for downstream
analysis tasks. Empirical results show that our framework not only helps
identify sources of discrepancies but also distinguishes between model accuracy
and data complexity, offering a more meaningful way to assess BPS quality.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了表格扩散模型中记忆化现象的分布及其动态特性，并提出了一种名为DynamicCut的两阶段缓解方法，以减少隐私泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量表格数据时存在隐私风险，可能复制训练样本。目前研究主要集中在数据集级别的增强以减少记忆化，但对个体样本的贡献知之甚少。

Method: 通过相对距离比量化每个真实样本的记忆化程度，分析记忆化动态，并提出DynamicCut方法：按记忆化强度排序样本、剪枝部分样本并重新训练。

Result: 实验表明记忆化分布呈现重尾特性，少数样本贡献了大部分泄露。DynamicCut能有效减少记忆化，同时保持数据多样性和下游性能。

Conclusion: DynamicCut是一种模型无关的缓解方法，可跨模型转移，适用于多种表格数据集和生成模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality
tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training
samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce
memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most.
We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular
diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how
many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance
ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of
memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately
to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we
divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their
training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and
monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized
slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these
insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method:
(a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and
(c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and
models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity
and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses.
Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked
samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective
for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.

Motivation: 探索PEFT在复杂任务中表现不佳的原因，并通过理论分析揭示其与FFT的关系。

Method: 基于优化理论比较PEFT和FFT的表征能力和鲁棒性，并通过实验验证理论。

Result: PEFT的表征能力受限于参数空间，对扰动更敏感，实验在15个数据集和11个对抗测试集上验证了这一点。

Conclusion: PEFT在复杂任务中存在局限性，未来研究需超越现有PEFT框架。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods achieve performance comparable
to Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) while requiring significantly fewer computing
resources, making it the go-to choice for researchers. We find that although
PEFT can achieve competitive results on some benchmarks, its performance falls
short of FFT in complex tasks, such as reasoning and instruction-based
fine-tuning. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of PEFT and FFT in
terms of representational capacity and robustness based on optimization theory.
We theoretically demonstrate that PEFT is a strict subset of FFT. By providing
theoretical upper bounds for PEFT, we show that the limited parameter space
constrains the model's representational ability, making it more susceptible to
perturbations. Experiments on 15 datasets encompassing classification,
generation, reasoning, instruction fine-tuning tasks and 11 adversarial test
sets validate our theories. We hope that these results spark further research
beyond the realms of well established PEFT. The source code is in the anonymous

Conclusion: 该方法能主动预防高风险应用中的潜在失败，适用于多种模型和领域。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in safety-critical domains poses a key
challenge: ensuring reliable model performance on downstream user data without
access to ground truth labels for direct validation. We propose the suitability
filter, a novel framework designed to detect performance deterioration by
utilizing suitability signals -- model output features that are sensitive to
covariate shifts and indicative of potential prediction errors. The suitability
filter evaluates whether classifier accuracy on unlabeled user data shows
significant degradation compared to the accuracy measured on the labeled test
dataset. Specifically, it ensures that this degradation does not exceed a
pre-specified margin, which represents the maximum acceptable drop in accuracy.
To achieve reliable performance evaluation, we aggregate suitability signals
for both test and user data and compare these empirical distributions using
statistical hypothesis testing, thus providing insights into decision
uncertainty. Our modular method adapts to various models and domains. Empirical
evaluations across different classification tasks demonstrate that the
suitability filter reliably detects performance deviations due to covariate
shift. This enables proactive mitigation of potential failures in high-stakes
applications.

TL;DR: OA-Adapter是一种参数高效的方法，通过动态预算分配和正交子空间学习结合，解决了大语言模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在持续学习中常因灾难性遗忘导致性能下降，现有方法存在预算分配固定或多阶段优化不对齐的问题。

Method: 提出OA-Adapter，通过动态瓶颈维度适应机制和正交约束，统一预算分配与任务优化。

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，OA-Adapter在准确率和参数效率上均优于现有方法，参数减少58.5%。

Conclusion: OA-Adapter通过端到端动态预算分配和正交学习，有效提升了持续学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in
continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned
tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although
pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task
interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the
varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive
tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple
optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential
misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies
dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single
end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic
bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an
efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.
To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with
the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically
between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically
allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on
continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving
higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL
benchmark.

Motivation: 探索多类设置下梯度下降的泛化性能，填补了以往主要研究二元分类的空白。

Method: 分析了损失函数衰减至零时梯度下降的收敛速率，特别关注损失模板的几何形状（基于p-范数）。

Result: 发现风险上界与损失模板的平滑性相关，且在不同p-范数下风险对类别数k的依赖不同（p=∞时为对数依赖，p=2时为线性依赖）。

Conclusion: 损失模板的几何形状在多类分类中起关键作用，且某些情况下对k的多项式依赖是不可避免的。

Abstract: We study the generalization performance of unregularized gradient methods for
separable linear classification. While previous work mostly deal with the
binary case, we focus on the multiclass setting with $k$ classes and establish
novel population risk bounds for Gradient Descent for loss functions that decay
to zero. In this setting, we show risk bounds that reveal that convergence
rates are crucially influenced by the geometry of the loss template, as
formalized by Wang and Scott (2024), rather than of the loss function itself.
Particularly, we establish risk upper bounds that holds for any decay rate of
the loss whose template is smooth with respect to the $p$-norm. In the case of
exponentially decaying losses, our results indicates a contrast between the
$p=\infty$ case, where the risk exhibits a logarithmic dependence on $k$, and
$p=2$ where the risk scales linearly with $k$. To establish this separation
formally, we also prove a lower bound in the latter scenario, demonstrating
that the polynomial dependence on $k$ is unavoidable. Central to our analysis
is a novel bound on the Rademacher complexity of low-noise vector-valued linear
predictors with a loss template smooth w.r.t.~general $p$-norms.

Conclusion: 提出的算法和分析框架在强盗优化和运营管理问题中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper studies a bandit optimization problem where the goal is to
maximize a function $f(x)$ over $T$ periods for some unknown strongly concave
function $f$. We consider a new pairwise comparison oracle, where the
decision-maker chooses a pair of actions $(x, x')$ for a consecutive number of
periods and then obtains an estimate of $f(x)-f(x')$. We show that such a
pairwise comparison oracle finds important applications to joint pricing and
inventory replenishment problems and network revenue management. The challenge
in this bandit optimization is twofold. First, the decision-maker not only
needs to determine a pair of actions $(x, x')$ but also a stopping time $n$
(i.e., the number of queries based on $(x, x')$). Second, motivated by our
inventory application, the estimate of the difference $f(x)-f(x')$ is biased,
which is different from existing oracles in stochastic optimization literature.
To address these challenges, we first introduce a discretization technique and
local polynomial approximation to relate this problem to linear bandits. Then
we developed a tournament successive elimination technique to localize the
discretized cell and run an interactive batched version of LinUCB algorithm on
cells. We establish regret bounds that are optimal up to poly-logarithmic
factors. Furthermore, we apply our proposed algorithm and analytical framework
to the two operations management problems and obtain results that improve
state-of-the-art results in the existing literature.

Conclusion: DHGNN通过门控机制捕捉方向性同质性差异，为复杂图结构上的消息传递行为提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various
learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to
generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the
directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on
directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed
Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses
these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive
components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate
message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a
structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node
representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments
on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that
DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link
prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to
15.07% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism
captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers,
providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph
structures.

Result: 实验表明，SplitLoRA在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SplitLoRA通过优化梯度空间划分，有效平衡了持续学习中的稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while
maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks,
and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged
as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient
space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary
subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the
minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired
knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an
optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to
appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a
continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained
considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and
propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first
provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model
stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an
effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for
previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and
plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在20个不同流程的实验中，AT-KDE比现有方法更准确、稳健且高效。

Conclusion: AT-KDE显著提升了业务流程模拟的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a critical tool for analyzing and
improving organizational processes by estimating the impact of process changes.
A key component of BPS is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern
of new case entries into a process. Although accurate case-arrival modeling is
essential for reliable simulations, as it influences waiting and overall cycle
times, existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of
inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal
complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate
and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose Auto Time Kernel
Density Estimation (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival
times of processes by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations,
and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability.
Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is
far more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining
sensible execution time efficiency.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法仅依赖最新任务的参数进行推理，容易导致灾难性遗忘。受模型合并技术启发，提出P&M框架以整合模型合并到持续学习中。

Method: P&M在每项任务训练后，通过凸组合构建新模型，优化合并系数，并引入基于任务向量和Hessian矩阵的正则化项，利用二阶对称有限差分高效近似。

Result: P&M在多个持续学习基准数据集上实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: P&M通过模型合并和正则化策略有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，结合LoRA进一步降低了内存开销，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new
knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned
information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the
most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic
forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we
propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework
that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting.
Specifically, after training on each task, P\&M constructs a new model by
forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained
task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss
increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal
merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we
observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a
regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the
loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently
approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic
perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised
which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an
effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&M
with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead.
Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
continual learning benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 扩散模型在物理系统建模中具有优势，但直接对干净样本施加PDE约束存在Jensen's Gap问题，导致生成精度与约束满足之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中，PIDDM显著优于现有方法（如PIDM、DiffusionPDE等），计算开销更低。

Conclusion: PIDDM为在扩散模型中高效融入物理约束提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages,
including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse
solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion
models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems,
particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate
steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are
typically applied to the expectation of clean samples
$\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the
learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation
does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's
Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the
cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are
not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a
post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed
Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only
facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also
support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from
randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE
benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over
several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and
ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on
more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints
into diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However,
these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during
inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant
deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we
aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from
the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the
tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in
the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the
activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau
and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore
systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking
phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that
the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional
steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a
novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the
low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the
interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models
validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining
and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method
also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token
reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks. Code is

Abstract: The construction of confidence intervals for the mean of a bounded random
variable is a classical problem in statistics with numerous applications in
machine learning and virtually all scientific fields. In particular, obtaining
the tightest possible confidence intervals is vital every time the sampling of
the random variables is expensive. The current state-of-the-art method to
construct confidence intervals is by using betting algorithms. This is a very
successful approach for deriving optimal confidence sequences, even matching
the rate of law of iterated logarithms. However, in the fixed horizon setting,
these approaches are either sub-optimal or based on heuristic solutions with
strong empirical performance but without a finite-time guarantee. Hence, no
betting-based algorithm guaranteeing the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\log\frac1\delta}{n}})$ width of the
confidence intervals are known. This work bridges this gap. We propose a
betting-based algorithm to compute confidence intervals that empirically
outperforms the competitors. Our betting strategy uses the optimal strategy in
every step (in a certain sense), whereas the standard betting methods choose a
constant strategy in advance. Leveraging this fact results in strict
improvements even for classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones of
Hoeffding or Bernstein. Moreover, we also prove that the width of our
confidence intervals is optimal up to an $1+o(1)$ factor diminishing with $n$.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in complex
reasoning tasks, yet they remain bottlenecked by two core challenges:
architectural inefficiency due to reliance on Transformers, and a lack of
structured fine-tuning for high-difficulty domains. We introduce \ourmodel, an
attention-free language model that addresses both issues through architectural
and data-centric innovations. Built on the state space dual (SSD) layers of
Mamba-2, our model eliminates the need for self-attention and key-value
caching, enabling fixed-memory, constant-time inference. To train it for
complex reasoning, we propose a two-phase curriculum fine-tuning strategy based
on the \textsc{PromptCoT} synthesis paradigm, which generates pedagogically
structured problems via abstract concept selection and rationale-guided
generation. On benchmark evaluations, \ourmodel-7B outperforms strong
Transformer and hybrid models of comparable scale, and even surpasses the much
larger Gemma3-27B by 2.6\% on AIME 24, 0.6\% on AIME 25, and 3.0\% on

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless technologies necessitates automated design
frameworks to address antenna miniaturization and performance optimization
within constrained development cycles. This study demonstrates a machine
learning enhanced workflow integrating Quantum-Behaved Dynamic Particle Swarm
Optimization (QDPSO) with ANSYS HFSS simulations to accelerate antenna design.
The QDPSO algorithm autonomously optimized loop dimensions in 11.53 seconds,
achieving a resonance frequency of 1.4208 GHz a 12.7 percent reduction compared
to conventional 1.60 GHz designs. Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest,
XGBoost, and Stacked ensembles) predicted resonance frequencies in 0.75 seconds
using 936 simulation datasets, with stacked models showing superior training
accuracy (R2=0.9825) and SVM demonstrating optimal validation performance
(R2=0.7197). The complete design cycle, encompassing optimization, prediction,
and ANSYS validation, required 12.42 minutes on standard desktop hardware
(Intel i5-8500, 16GB RAM), contrasting sharply with the 50-hour benchmark of
PSADEA-based approaches. This 240 times of acceleration eliminates traditional
trial-and-error methods that often extend beyond seven expert-led days. The
system enables precise specifications of performance targets with automated
generation of fabrication-ready parameters, particularly benefiting compact
consumer devices requiring rapid frequency tuning. By bridging AI-driven
optimization with CAD validation, this framework reduces engineering workloads
while ensuring production-ready designs, establishing a scalable paradigm for
next-generation RF systems in 6G and IoT applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种算法（SOReL和TOReL），旨在解决离线强化学习中样本效率低和超参数调优依赖在线交互的问题，推动离线RL在实际应用中的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习（RL）在实际应用中面临样本效率低和超参数调优依赖在线交互的问题，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 1. SOReL：基于贝叶斯方法，利用离线数据推断环境动态的后验分布，通过后验预测不确定性估计在线性能，完全离线调优超参数。2. TOReL：扩展信息率基础的离线超参数调优方法，适用于通用离线RL算法。

Result: 实验表明，SOReL能准确估计贝叶斯设置下的遗憾值，TOReL的离线超参数调优表现与最佳在线调优方法相当。

Conclusion: SOReL和TOReL为离线RL的安全性和可靠性提供了重要进展，推动了RL在现实世界中的应用。

Abstract: Sample efficiency remains a major obstacle for real world adoption of
reinforcement learning (RL): success has been limited to settings where
simulators provide access to essentially unlimited environment interactions,
which in reality are typically costly or dangerous to obtain. Offline RL in
principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal
policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely
on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no
reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two
issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe
offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach
infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of
the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all
hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a
tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our
information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline
RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately
estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter
tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter
tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a
significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential
for RL in the real world. Our implementations are publicly available:

Result: 研究发现所有当前的生成保真度和多样性指标均存在缺陷，严重阻碍了合成数据的实际应用。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区更多关注指标开发，并为实践者提供当前指标的使用指南。

Abstract: Any method's development and practical application is limited by our ability
to measure its reliability. The popularity of generative modeling emphasizes
the importance of good synthetic data metrics. Unfortunately, previous works
have found many failure cases in current metrics, for example lack of outlier
robustness and unclear lower and upper bounds. We propose a list of desiderata
for synthetic data metrics, and a suite of sanity checks: carefully chosen
simple experiments that aim to detect specific and known generative modeling
failure modes. Based on these desiderata and the results of our checks, we
arrive at our position: all current generative fidelity and diversity metrics
are flawed. This significantly hinders practical use of synthetic data. Our aim
is to convince the research community to spend more effort in developing
metrics, instead of models. Additionally, through analyzing how current metrics
fail, we provide practitioners with guidelines on how these metrics should
(not) be used.

general setting. Finally, we present a framework, Sticky-Sequence
Track-and-Stop, which generalizes both Track-and-Stop and Sticky

our analysis also highlights special cases where existing methods enjoy
optimality.

Abstract: The forecasting of multivariate urban data presents a complex challenge due
to the intricate dependencies between various urban metrics such as weather,
air pollution, carbon intensity, and energy demand. This paper introduces a
novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that utilizes advanced Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture spatial dependencies among different
time-series variables. The proposed model incorporates a decomposition-based
preprocessing step, isolating trend, seasonal, and residual components to
enhance the accuracy and interpretability of forecasts. By leveraging the
dynamic capabilities of GNNs, the model effectively captures interdependencies
and improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets, including electricity usage, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and
air pollution data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
across various forecasting scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
the model to optimize smart infrastructure systems, contributing to
energy-efficient urban development and enhanced public well-being.

Result: 结果表明两种算法在非渐近性条件下仍具有良好性能。

Conclusion: 结论是这些算法不仅在渐近性条件下最优，在非渐近性条件下也表现优异。

Abstract: In pure exploration problems, a statistician sequentially collects
information to answer a question about some stochastic and unknown environment.
The probability of returning a wrong answer should not exceed a maximum risk
parameter $\delta$ and good algorithms make as few queries to the environment
as possible. The Track-and-Stop algorithm is a pioneering method to solve these
problems. Specifically, it is well-known that it enjoys asymptotic optimality
sample complexity guarantees for $\delta\to 0$ whenever the map from the
environment to its correct answers is single-valued (e.g., best-arm
identification with a unique optimal arm). The Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithm
extends these results to settings where, for each environment, there might
exist multiple correct answers (e.g., $\epsilon$-optimal arm identification).
Although both methods are optimal in the asymptotic regime, their
non-asymptotic guarantees remain unknown. In this work, we fill this gap and
provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both algorithms.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效防止模态崩溃，适用于处理缺失模态的场景。

Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a
recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal
fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We
show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are
entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive
features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the
predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We
further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles
such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder,
denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive
features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an
algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation,
with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on
multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page:

Motivation: 通过能量视角理解对抗训练中的分类器行为，特别是灾难性过拟合（CO）和鲁棒过拟合（RO）现象。

Method: 分析对抗样本与自然样本的能量差异，提出DER正则化器平滑能量景观，并结合局部类PCA改进生成能力。

Conclusion: 能量视角为对抗训练提供了新见解，DER和生成改进技术展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We aim at using Energy-based Model (EBM) framework to better understand
adversarial training (AT) in classifiers, and additionally to analyze the
intrinsic generative capabilities of robust classifiers. By viewing standard
classifiers through an energy lens, we begin by analyzing how the energies of
adversarial examples, generated by various attacks, differ from those of the
natural samples. The central focus of our work is to understand the critical
phenomena of Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) in AT
from an energy perspective. We analyze the impact of existing AT approaches on
the energy of samples during training and observe that the behavior of the
``delta energy' -- change in energy between original sample and its adversarial
counterpart -- diverges significantly when CO or RO occurs. After a thorough
analysis of these energy dynamics and their relationship with overfitting, we
propose a novel regularizer, the Delta Energy Regularizer (DER), designed to
smoothen the energy landscape during training. We demonstrate that DER is
effective in mitigating both CO and RO across multiple benchmarks. We further
show that robust classifiers, when being used as generative models, have limits
in handling trade-off between image quality and variability. We propose an
improved technique based on a local class-wise principal component analysis
(PCA) and energy-based guidance for better class-specific initialization and
adaptive stopping, enhancing sample diversity and generation quality.
Considering that we do not explicitly train for generative modeling, we achieve
a competitive Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID)
compared to hybrid discriminative-generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了标准参数化（SP）在训练大规模视觉和语言模型时的理论与实践的差异，发现交叉熵损失（CE）下存在一个稳定的“受控发散”机制，而均方误差（MSE）损失则不具备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论无法解释标准参数化在实际训练中的成功，尤其是在大学习率下的稳定性问题。

Method: 通过分析神经网络训练动态，证明交叉熵损失下存在受控发散机制，并验证了不同优化器、架构和数据模态下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，交叉熵损失下网络能在受控发散状态下稳定训练，而均方误差损失则不行。

Conclusion: 交叉熵损失是实现稳定训练的关键，宽度缩放对预测最优学习率有指导意义。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is
He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard
parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization
remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing
infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and
vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically
optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically
predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we
demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width
phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and
incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be
fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to
Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an
intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits
diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training
under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all
hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments
across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities
(vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled
divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence
suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for
predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis
clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise
learning rate scalings for standard initialization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习中的离策略评估（OPE），重点探讨了行为策略估计对重要性采样的影响。研究发现，历史依赖的行为策略估计可以降低均方误差（MSE），并通过理论分析揭示了其背后的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明，即使真实行为策略是马尔可夫的，历史依赖的行为策略估计也能降低MSE，但其原因尚不明确。本文旨在从理论上解释这一现象。

Method: 通过推导普通重要性采样（IS）估计器的MSE的偏差-方差分解，分析了历史依赖行为策略估计对渐近方差和有限样本偏差的影响，并将结果扩展到其他OPE估计器。

Result: 研究发现，历史依赖的行为策略估计会降低渐近方差，但增加有限样本偏差；随着历史长度的增加，方差持续减小。

Conclusion: 本文为历史依赖行为策略估计在OPE中的优势提供了理论支持，并验证了其在多种估计器中的适用性。

Abstract: This paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning with
a focus on behavior policy estimation for importance sampling. Prior work has
shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead
to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is
Markovian. However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE
remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by
deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance
sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy
estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their
finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions
on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these
findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS
estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with
the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.

Conclusion: ProSpero为高效蛋白质工程提供了一种新方法，突破了野生型邻域的限制，同时保持了生物可行性。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences of both high fitness and novelty is a challenging
task in data-efficient protein engineering. Exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on
surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose
ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative
model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating
fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential
Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our
framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero
consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein
engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.

Result: GNN在固定纯度下表现出更高的分段效率，且通过GPU批量处理实现显著加速。

Conclusion: GNN是核物理实验中粒子轨迹追踪的有效替代方案，尤其在处理大数据时具有速度和效率优势。

Abstract: Nuclear physics experiments are aimed at uncovering the fundamental building
blocks of matter. The experiments involve high-energy collisions that produce
complex events with many particle trajectories. Tracking charged particles
resulting from collisions in the presence of a strong magnetic field is
critical to enable the reconstruction of particle trajectories and precise
determination of interactions. It is traditionally achieved through
combinatorial approaches that scale worse than linearly as the number of hits
grows. Since particle hit data naturally form a 3-dimensional point cloud and
can be structured as graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an
intuitive and effective choice for this task. In this study, we evaluate the
GNN model for track finding on the data from the GlueX experiment at Jefferson
Lab. We use simulation data to train the model and test on both simulation and
real GlueX measurements. We demonstrate that GNN-based track finding
outperforms the currently used traditional method at GlueX in terms of
segment-based efficiency at a fixed purity while providing faster inferences.
We show that the GNN model can achieve significant speedup by processing
multiple events in batches, which exploits the parallel computation capability
of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, we compare the GNN
implementation on GPU and FPGA and describe the trade-off.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a predominant tool in mechanistic
interpretability, aiming to identify interpretable monosemantic features.
However, how does sparse encoding organize the representations of activation
vector from language models? What is the relationship between this
organizational paradigm and feature disentanglement as well as reconstruction
performance? To address these questions, we propose the SAEMA, which validates
the stratified structure of the representation by observing the variability of
the rank of the symmetric semipositive definite (SSPD) matrix corresponding to
the modal tensor unfolded along the latent tensor with the level of noise added
to the residual stream. To systematically investigate how sparse encoding
alters representational structures, we define local and global representations,
demonstrating that they amplify inter-feature distinctions by merging similar
semantic features and introducing additional dimensionality. Furthermore, we
intervene the global representation from an optimization perspective, proving a
significant causal relationship between their separability and the
reconstruction performance. This study explains the principles of sparsity from
the perspective of representational geometry and demonstrates the impact of
changes in representational structure on reconstruction performance.
Particularly emphasizes the necessity of understanding representations and
incorporating representational constraints, providing empirical references for
developing new interpretable tools and improving SAEs. The code is available at

Conclusion: 可微分停止时间为优化问题提供了新的可微框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Optimization is an important module of modern machine learning applications.
Tremendous efforts have been made to accelerate optimization algorithms. A
common formulation is achieving a lower loss at a given time. This enables a
differentiable framework with respect to the algorithm hyperparameters. In
contrast, its dual, minimizing the time to reach a target loss, is believed to
be non-differentiable, as the time is not differentiable. As a result, it
usually serves as a conceptual framework or is optimized using zeroth-order
methods. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable stopping time
and theoretically justify it based on differential equations. An efficient
algorithm is designed to backpropagate through it. As a result, the proposed
differentiable stopping time enables a new differentiable formulation for
accelerating algorithms. We further discuss its applications, such as online
hyperparameter tuning and learning to optimize. Our proposed methods show
superior performance in comprehensive experiments across various problems,
which confirms their effectiveness.

Conclusion: 模型选择需根据具体风险容忍度和操作需求，强调平衡召回率和精度的重要性。

Abstract: Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as
finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to
significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the
performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset.
While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior
performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression
offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong
recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision,
highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation
emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and
F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting
rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the
importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and
operational needs of fraud detection systems.

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练即可实现约束条件下的高效生成。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various
domains. However, real-world applications often require the generative process
to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this
end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to
sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our
approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal,
obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address
the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a
Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation
within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic
datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 开放式学习（OEL）在AI领域显示出潜力，但将其应用于现实网络安全仍具挑战性。论文旨在通过OEL开发更鲁棒和通用的网络防御代理。

Method: 提出了一种任务表示方法，确保在多样化网络条件、攻击者行为和防御目标下保持一致的接口，使代理能基于先前知识持续学习。

Result: 结果表明，OEL原则能成功应用于网络防御领域，提升代理的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文为网络安全领域的AI研究提供了工具和框架，强调了任务多样性和表示一致性的重要性。

Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve
broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop
artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization.
However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL,
applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity
applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous
network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL
principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber
defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several
technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task
representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a
consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the
learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors,
and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that
applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers
develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they
consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we
propose in our work.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum generative model for synthesizing
tabular data. Synthetic data is valuable in scenarios where real-world data is
scarce or private, it can be used to augment or replace existing datasets.
Real-world enterprise data is predominantly tabular and heterogeneous, often
comprising a mixture of categorical and numerical features, making it highly
relevant across various industries such as healthcare, finance, and software.
We propose a quantum generative adversarial network architecture with flexible
data encoding and a novel quantum circuit ansatz to effectively model tabular
data. The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult
Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models,
CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model
outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall
similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of
the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities
of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of
the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first demonstrations of a successful quantum
generative model for handling tabular data, indicating that this task could be
well-suited to quantum computers.

Motivation: 解决不确定性量化问题，提出基于严格适当评分规则的总、随机和认知不确定性度量方法。

Method: 通过将严格适当评分规则分解为发散和熵分量，构建灵活框架，适用于不同损失函数。

Result: 在选择性预测任务中，评分规则应与任务损失匹配；在分布外检测中，互信息表现最佳；在主动学习中，基于零一损失的认知不确定性度量优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架灵活且实用，能够根据不同任务需求定制不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification and propose measures of
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on a known decomposition of
(strictly) proper scoring rules, a specific type of loss function, into a
divergence and an entropy component. This leads to a flexible framework for
uncertainty quantification that can be instantiated with different losses
(scoring rules), which makes it possible to tailor uncertainty quantification
to the use case at hand. We show that this flexibility is indeed advantageous.
In particular, we analyze the task of selective prediction and show that the
scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. In addition, we perform
experiments on two other common tasks. For out-of-distribution detection, our
results confirm that a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, mutual
information, performs best. Moreover, in the setting of active learning, our
measure of epistemic uncertainty based on the zero-one-loss consistently
outperforms other uncertainty measures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks form the backbone of artificial intelligence research,
with potential to transform the human experience in areas ranging from
autonomous driving to personal assistants, healthcare to education. However,
their integration into the daily routines of real-world classrooms remains
limited. It is not yet common for a teacher to assign students individualized
homework targeting their specific weaknesses, provide students with instant
feedback, or simulate student responses to a new exam question. While these
models excel in predictive performance, this lack of adoption can be attributed
to a significant weakness: the lack of explainability of model decisions,
leading to a lack of trust from students, parents, and teachers. This thesis
aims to bring human needs to the forefront of eXplainable AI (XAI) research,
grounded in the concrete use case of personalized learning and teaching. We
frame the contributions along two verticals: technical advances in XAI and
their aligned human studies. We investigate explainability in AI for education,
revealing systematic disagreements between post-hoc explainers and identifying
a need for inherently interpretable model architectures. We propose four novel
technical contributions in interpretability with a multimodal modular
architecture (MultiModN), an interpretable mixture-of-experts model
(InterpretCC), adversarial training for explainer stability, and a
theory-driven LLM-XAI framework to present explanations to students
(iLLuMinaTE), which we evaluate in diverse settings with professors, teachers,
learning scientists, and university students. By combining empirical
evaluations of existing explainers with novel architectural designs and human
studies, our work lays a foundation for human-centric AI systems that balance
state-of-the-art performance with built-in transparency and trust.

Motivation: 分布式数据并行（DDP）方法在基础模型训练中存在带宽限制，现有方法如Local SGD无法直接应用于自适应优化器。

Method: 提出DES-LOC，为参数和动量分配独立的同步周期，降低通信成本。

Result: 实验表明，DES-LOC通信量比DDP少170倍，比Local ADAM少2倍，且适用于易发生系统故障的实际场景。

Conclusion: DES-LOC为大规模模型训练提供了可扩展、高效且容错的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling foundation model training with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)
methods is bandwidth-limited. Existing infrequent communication methods like
Local SGD were designed to synchronize only model parameters and cannot be
trivially applied to adaptive optimizers due to additional optimizer states.
Current approaches extending Local SGD either lack convergence guarantees or
require synchronizing all optimizer states, tripling communication costs. We
propose Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers (DES-LOC), a family of
optimizers assigning independent synchronization periods to parameters and
momenta, enabling lower communication costs while preserving convergence.
Through extensive experiments on language models of up to 1.7B, we show that
DES-LOC can communicate 170x less than DDP and 2x less than the previous
state-of-the-art Local ADAM. Furthermore, unlike previous heuristic approaches,
DES-LOC is suited for practical training scenarios prone to system failures.
DES-LOC offers a scalable, bandwidth-efficient, and fault-tolerant solution for
foundation model training.

Motivation: 在建模生物、化学和物理系统时，处理全局几何上下文并保持等变性至关重要，但现有方法在计算复杂性和全局信息保留上存在不足。

Method: 受状态空间和长卷积模型的启发，提出Geometric Hyena模型，通过长卷积在次二次复杂度下捕获全局几何上下文。

Result: 在大型RNA分子和蛋白质分子动力学的全原子性质预测中，Geometric Hyena优于现有等变模型，计算和内存需求显著降低。

Conclusion: Geometric Hyena在保持等变性的同时，高效处理大规模几何上下文，为相关领域提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Processing global geometric context while preserving equivariance is crucial
when modeling biological, chemical, and physical systems. Yet, this is
challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context
at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from
quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message
passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of
state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the
first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric
Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while
maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom
property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics,
Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring
significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably,
our model processes the geometric context of 30k tokens 20x faster than the
equivariant transformer and allows 72x longer context within the same budget.

Result: FNOPE能以较低的计算成本实现函数值参数的推理，并支持任意离散化和向量值参数的估计。

Conclusion: FNOPE扩展了SBI方法的应用范围，使其能够处理函数值参数的推理问题。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is an established approach for performing
Bayesian inference on scientific simulators. SBI so far works best on
low-dimensional parametric models. However, it is difficult to infer
function-valued parameters, which frequently occur in disciplines that model
spatiotemporal processes such as the climate and earth sciences. Here, we
introduce an approach for efficient posterior estimation, using a Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO) architecture with a flow matching objective. We show that
our approach, FNOPE, can perform inference of function-valued parameters at a
fraction of the simulation budget of state of the art methods. In addition,
FNOPE supports posterior evaluation at arbitrary discretizations of the domain,
as well as simultaneous estimation of vector-valued parameters. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks and a challenging
spatial inference task from glaciology. FNOPE extends the applicability of SBI
methods to new scientific domains by enabling the inference of function-valued
parameters.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The optimization of neural networks under weight decay remains poorly
understood from a theoretical standpoint. While weight decay is standard
practice in modern training procedures, most theoretical analyses focus on
unregularized settings. In this work, we investigate the loss landscape of the
$\ell_2$-regularized training loss for two-layer ReLU networks. We show that
the landscape becomes benign -- i.e., free of spurious local minima -- under
large overparametrization, specifically when the network width $m$ satisfies $m
\gtrsim \min(n^d, 2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $d$ the
input dimension. More precisely in this regime, almost all constant activation
regions contain a global minimum and no spurious local minima. We further show
that this level of overparametrization is not only sufficient but also
necessary via the example of orthogonal data. Finally, we demonstrate that such
loss landscape results primarily hold relevance in the large initialization
regime. In contrast, for small initializations -- corresponding to the feature
learning regime -- optimization can still converge to spurious local minima,
despite the global benignity of the landscape.

Result: 为不同模型类提供了精确和近似的遗忘保证，实验表明该框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的新框架在过参数化设置下有效解决了机器遗忘问题，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the influence of specific
training samples, ideally recovering the model that would have resulted from
training on the remaining data alone. We study unlearning in the
overparameterized setting, where many models interpolate the data, and defining
the unlearning solution as any loss minimizer over the retained
set$\unicode{x2013}$as in prior work in the underparameterized
setting$\unicode{x2013}$is inadequate, since the original model may already
interpolate the retained data and satisfy this condition. In this regime, loss
gradients vanish, rendering prior methods based on gradient perturbations
ineffective, motivating both new unlearning definitions and algorithms. For
this setting, we define the unlearning solution as the minimum-complexity
interpolator over the retained data and propose a new algorithmic framework
that only requires access to model gradients on the retained set at the
original solution. We minimize a regularized objective over perturbations
constrained to be orthogonal to these model gradients, a first-order relaxation
of the interpolation condition. For different model classes, we provide exact
and approximate unlearning guarantees, and we demonstrate that an
implementation of our framework outperforms existing baselines across various
unlearning experiments.

Abstract: Sequential learning -- where complex tasks are broken down into simpler,
hierarchical components -- has emerged as a paradigm in AI. This paper views
sequential learning through the lens of low-rank linear regression, focusing
specifically on how errors propagate when learning rank-1 subspaces
sequentially. We present an analysis framework that decomposes the learning
process into a series of rank-1 estimation problems, where each subsequent
estimation depends on the accuracy of previous steps. Our contribution is a
characterization of the error propagation in this sequential process,
establishing bounds on how errors -- e.g., due to limited computational budgets
and finite precision -- affect the overall model accuracy. We prove that these
errors compound in predictable ways, with implications for both algorithmic
design and stability guarantees.

Abstract: This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with
LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently
observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy
entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished
exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy
performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b
between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly
indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus
bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0,
R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration
toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics
both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change
in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and
the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy
Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance
term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical
conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout
training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically.
Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to
control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens.
Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov
and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances
respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus
helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream
performance.

Result: 所有提示类型均产生正向转向效果，但效果方差大且有时相反；激活差异余弦相似度高时转向更有效。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method to control language model behavior
by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although
steering demonstrates promising performance, recent work shows that it can be
unreliable or even counterproductive in some cases. This paper studies the
influence of prompt types and the geometry of activation differences on
steering reliability. First, we find that all seven prompt types used in our
experiments produce a net positive steering effect, but exhibit high variance
across samples, and often give an effect opposite of the desired one. No prompt
type clearly outperforms the others, and yet the steering vectors resulting
from the different prompt types often differ directionally (as measured by
cosine similarity). Second, we show that higher cosine similarity between
training set activation differences predicts more effective steering. Finally,
we observe that datasets where positive and negative activations are better
separated are more steerable. Our results suggest that vector steering is
unreliable when the target behavior is not represented by a coherent direction.

Abstract: Survival analysis is widely deployed in a diverse set of fields, including

is a semi-parametric model often encountered in the literature. Despite its
popularity, wide deployment, and numerous variants, scaling CoxPH to large

high-dimensional regime. We identify a fundamental connection between rank
regression and the CoxPH model: this allows us to adapt and extend the
so-called spectral method for rank regression to survival analysis. Our
approach is versatile, naturally generalizing to several CoxPH variants,
including deep models. We empirically verify our method's scalability on
multiple real-world high-dimensional datasets; our method outperforms legacy

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
complex mathematical and logical problems. However, it can often veer off track
through incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences. Formal mathematical reasoning,
which can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this
issue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex
problems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem
statement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider
the problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step
solution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output [Yes] if the
reasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise. In this work
we give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose
and analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of
strength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for
learning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and
impossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives
without additional assumptions.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong
outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully
prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to
quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this
traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and
interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user,
and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel
scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose
their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel
research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer
interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide
all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning,
to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current
context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech
space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these
new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent
interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.

Motivation: 强化学习中的奖励函数设计是一个难题，尤其是在缺乏外部监督的情况下。本文旨在探索一种无需外部奖励的无监督强化学习方法。

Method: 提出RENT方法，利用模型生成答案的熵作为内在奖励，通过强化高置信度的思维链来提升推理能力。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500等推理基准测试中，模型表现显著提升，且方法适用于不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: RENT方法在无监督环境下具有广泛适用性，尤其在外部监督有限或不可得的领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve
significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier
language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems.
However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward
engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we
propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully
unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth
answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as
an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that
yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its
reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an
extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K,
MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and
Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends
itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision
is limited or unavailable.

### [269] [VietASR: Achieving Industry-level Vietnamese ASR with 50-hour labeled data and Large-Scale Speech Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21527)
*Jianheng Zhuo,Yifan Yang,Yiwen Shao,Yong Xu,Dong Yu,Kai Yu,Xie Chen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VietASR提出了一种基于自监督学习的低成本、高效ASR训练方法，适用于低资源语言如越南语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言ASR系统依赖大规模标注数据的问题，同时降低训练成本和延迟。

Method: 利用大规模未标注数据和少量标注数据，通过多轮自监督学习训练ASR模型。

Result: 在7万小时未标注数据和50小时标注数据上训练的轻量模型，性能优于Whisper Large-v3和商业ASR系统。

Conclusion: VietASR为低资源ASR提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made remarkable progress but heavily
relies on large-scale labeled data, which is scarce for low-resource languages
like Vietnamese. While existing systems such as Whisper, USM, and MMS achieve
promising performance, their efficacy remains inadequate in terms of training
costs, latency, and accessibility. To address these issues, we propose VietASR,
a novel ASR training pipeline that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data and
a small set of labeled data. Through multi-iteration ASR-biased self-supervised
learning on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, VietASR offers a cost-effective
and practical solution for enhancing ASR performance. Experiments demonstrate
that pre-training on 70,000-hour unlabeled data and fine-tuning on merely
50-hour labeled data yield a lightweight but powerful ASR model. It outperforms
Whisper Large-v3 and commercial ASR systems on real-world data. Our code and
models will be open-sourced to facilitate research in low-resource ASR.

*Emmanuel Akinrintoyo,Nadine Abdelhalim,Nicole Salomons*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Whisper模型在转录痴呆症患者语音时表现不佳，但通过微调DementiaBank和内部数据集，显著降低了词错误率（WER），并提高了填充词识别率（FIR）和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症患者（PwDs）的语音模式不规则且不流畅，导致标准语音训练的Whisper模型转录效果差，而准确的转录对低成本诊断和辅助技术开发至关重要。

Method: 使用开源痴呆症语音数据集（DementiaBank）和内部数据集对Whisper进行微调，包括填充词以评估FIR和F1分数。

Result: 微调后的模型显著优于现成模型，中等大小模型的WER为0.24，且对未见数据和语音模式具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 微调Whisper模型能有效提升其对痴呆症患者语音的转录准确性，为诊断和辅助技术提供支持。

Abstract: Whisper fails to correctly transcribe dementia speech because persons with
dementia (PwDs) often exhibit irregular speech patterns and disfluencies such
as pauses, repetitions, and fragmented sentences. It was trained on standard
speech and may have had little or no exposure to dementia-affected speech.
However, correct transcription is vital for dementia speech for cost-effective
diagnosis and the development of assistive technology. In this work, we
fine-tune Whisper with the open-source dementia speech dataset (DementiaBank)
and our in-house dataset to improve its word error rate (WER). The fine-tuning
also includes filler words to ascertain the filler inclusion rate (FIR) and F1
score. The fine-tuned models significantly outperformed the off-the-shelf
models. The medium-sized model achieved a WER of 0.24, outperforming previous
work. Similarly, there was a notable generalisability to unseen data and speech
patterns.

*Yuan Tseng,Titouan Parcollet,Rogier van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究发现LibriSpeech和Common Voice评估集中的大量数据出现在LLM预训练语料中，质疑了基于这些数据集的结论可靠性。实验表明，受污染的LLM更倾向于生成训练中见过的句子，且语音识别系统对训练见过的转录赋予更高概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLM在语音任务中性能提升的可靠性，尤其是评估数据是否被预训练污染。

Method: 比较受污染和未受污染的LLM，分析其对测试句子生成和语音识别性能的影响。

Result: 受污染的LLM更易生成训练见过的句子，语音识别系统对见过的转录赋予更高概率，但错误率差异较小。

Conclusion: 数据污染会显著影响LLM输出，强调需使用独立数据评估LLM语音系统。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve
performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their
claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this
work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice
evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into
question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure
the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are
compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test
sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated
LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly
higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that
LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting
the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM-Dys数据集，利用LLM增强的模拟方法生成更自然的语音不流畅数据，并基于此改进端到端检测框架，取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音不流畅检测方法受限于高质量标注数据的稀缺性，且现有合成数据集存在不自然的韵律和有限的上下文多样性。

Method: 提出LLM-Dys数据集，涵盖11种不流畅类别，结合LLM增强模拟方法生成更自然的数据，并改进端到端检测框架。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: LLM-Dys数据集和检测框架为语音不流畅检测提供了更全面的解决方案，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Speech dysfluency detection is crucial for clinical diagnosis and language
assessment, but existing methods are limited by the scarcity of high-quality
annotated data. Although recent advances in TTS model have enabled synthetic
dysfluency generation, existing synthetic datasets suffer from unnatural
prosody and limited contextual diversity. To address these limitations, we
propose LLM-Dys -- the most comprehensive dysfluent speech corpus with
LLM-enhanced dysfluency simulation. This dataset captures 11 dysfluency
categories spanning both word and phoneme levels. Building upon this resource,
we improve an end-to-end dysfluency detection framework. Experimental
validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. All data, models, and
code are open-sourced at https://github.com/Berkeley-Speech-Group/LLM-Dys.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型语言模型（LLM）中键值缓存（KVC）管理的效率问题，强调需要针对LLM工作负载优化的分布式缓存系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，键值缓存（KVC）管理对推理性能优化至关重要，但目前缺乏针对KVC预填充的专用存储解决方案。

Method: 通过分析公开的真实KVC访问模式，评估了Redis等商业键值存储及RDMA系统（如CHIME和Sherman）在KVC元数据管理中的表现。

Result: 研究发现现有系统在KVC管理上存在不足，亟需优化元数据管理的分布式缓存系统。

Conclusion: 论文为设计高效、低延迟的KVC管理系统提供了见解，以满足LLM工作负载的需求。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) with extended context
windows necessitates efficient Key-Value Cache (KVC) management to optimize
inference performance. Inference workloads like Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and agents exhibit high cache reusability, making efficient caching
critical to reducing redundancy and improving speed. We analyze real-world KVC
access patterns using publicly available traces and evaluate commercial
key-value stores like Redis and state-of-the-art RDMA-based systems (CHIME [1]
and Sherman [2]) for KVC metadata management. Our work demonstrates the lack of
tailored storage solution for KVC prefilling, underscores the need for an
efficient distributed caching system with optimized metadata management for LLM
workloads, and provides insights into designing improved KVC management systems
for scalable, low-latency inference.

*Dhruv Agarwal,Anya Shukla,Sunayana Sitaram,Aditya Vashistha*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，印度本地化的大型语言模型（LLMs）在文化价值观和实践上与全球模型相比并未更贴近印度文化，甚至不如普通美国人对印度文化的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在文化上的西方倾向问题，探讨本地化模型是否能真正反映当地文化。

Method: 以印度为例，评估五个印度本地和五个全球LLMs，通过价值观和实践两个维度（使用Inglehart-Welzel地图、GlobalOpinionQA、CulturalBench和NormAd）。

Result: 印度本地模型在文化对齐上未优于全球模型，且区域微调反而可能损害文化能力。

Conclusion: 高质量、未翻译且文化相关的训练数据稀缺是主要原因，呼吁加强文化代表性数据的投入。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used around the world but exhibit Western
cultural tendencies. To address this cultural misalignment, many countries have
begun developing "regional" LLMs tailored to local communities. Yet it remains
unclear whether these models merely speak the language of their users or also
reflect their cultural values and practices. Using India as a case study, we
evaluate five Indic and five global LLMs along two key dimensions: values (via
the Inglehart-Welzel map and GlobalOpinionQA) and practices (via CulturalBench
and NormAd). Across all four tasks, we find that Indic models do not align more
closely with Indian cultural norms than global models. In fact, an average
American person is a better proxy for Indian cultural values than any Indic
model. Even prompting strategies fail to meaningfully improve alignment.
Ablations show that regional fine-tuning does not enhance cultural competence
and may in fact hurt it by impeding recall of existing knowledge. We trace this
failure to the scarcity of high-quality, untranslated, and culturally grounded
pretraining and fine-tuning data. Our study positions cultural evaluation as a
first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offers a reusable
methodology for developers. We call for deeper investments in culturally
representative data to build and evaluate truly sovereign LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了印度-雅利安语系（如印地语、古吉拉特语和孟加拉语）中数字系统的高度非透明性，并通过跨语言数据量化其复杂性，探讨了导致这种复杂性的语言和非语言因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度-雅利安语系的数字系统在1-99范围内表现出高度非透明性，无法通过简单规则构建。论文旨在解释这种复杂性为何在这些语言中持续存在。

Method: 利用跨语言数据库数据，开发并应用量化数字系统复杂性的指标，比较印度-雅利安语系与其他语言的差异，并分析影响因素（如宗教、地理隔离等）。

Result: 印度-雅利安语系的数字系统比其他语言更复杂，但内部差异显著。研究发现这些系统仍遵循跨语言的效率原则。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在讨论跨语言数字系统变异时，应重视这种被忽视的复杂性维度。

Abstract: The numeral systems of Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, and
Bengali are highly unusual in that unlike most numeral systems (e.g., those of
English, Chinese, etc.), forms referring to 1--99 are highly non-transparent
and are cannot be constructed using straightforward rules. As an example,
Hindi/Urdu *iky\=anve* `91' is not decomposable into the composite elements
*ek* `one' and *nave* `ninety' in the way that its English counterpart is. This
paper situates Indo-Aryan languages within the typology of cross-linguistic
numeral systems, and explores the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that
may be responsible for the persistence of complex systems in these languages.
Using cross-linguistic data from multiple databases, we develop and employ a
number of cross-linguistically applicable metrics to quantifies the complexity
of languages' numeral systems, and demonstrate that Indo-Aryan languages have
decisively more complex numeral systems than the world's languages as a whole,
though individual Indo-Aryan languages differ from each other in terms of the
complexity of the patterns they display. We investigate the factors (e.g.,
religion, geographic isolation, etc.) that underlie complexity in numeral
systems, with a focus on South Asia, in an attempt to develop an account of why
complex numeral systems developed and persisted in certain Indo-Aryan languages
but not elsewhere. Finally, we demonstrate that Indo-Aryan numeral systems
adhere to certain general pressures toward efficient communication found
cross-linguistically, despite their high complexity. We call for this somewhat
overlooked dimension of complexity to be taken seriously when discussing
general variation in cross-linguistic numeral systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出Align-DA方法，通过生成过程和奖励信号优化数据同化中的背景先验，替代传统手动调整方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据同化方法依赖经验性简化背景先验，需手动调整，效率低且适应性差。

Method: Align-DA将数据同化建模为生成过程，利用三种奖励信号（同化精度、预报技能、物理一致性）训练基于分数的模型。

Result: 实验表明，多奖励信号显著提升分析质量，适应不同评估指标和观测策略。

Conclusion: 偏好对齐作为软约束，能自动优化复杂背景先验，为数据同化领域提供新方向。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) aims to estimate the full state of a dynamical system
by combining partial and noisy observations with a prior model forecast,
commonly referred to as the background. In atmospheric applications, this
problem is fundamentally ill-posed due to the sparsity of observations relative
to the high-dimensional state space. Traditional methods address this challenge
by simplifying background priors to regularize the solution, which are
empirical and require continual tuning for application. Inspired by alignment
techniques in text-to-image diffusion models, we propose Align-DA, which
formulates DA as a generative process and uses reward signals to guide
background priors, replacing manual tuning with data-driven alignment.
Specifically, we train a score-based model in the latent space to approximate
the background-conditioned prior, and align it using three complementary reward
signals for DA: (1) assimilation accuracy, (2) forecast skill initialized from
the assimilated state, and (3) physical adherence of the analysis fields.
Experiments with multiple reward signals demonstrate consistent improvements in
analysis quality across different evaluation metrics and observation-guidance
strategies. These results show that preference alignment, implemented as a soft
constraint, can automatically adapt complex background priors tailored to DA,
offering a promising new direction for advancing the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法在零样本VC场景下效果不佳，无法追踪未经训练的克隆模型生成的音频。

Method: 提出VoiceMark，利用说话者特定潜在特征作为水印载体，并引入VC模拟增强和基于VAD的损失以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个零样本VC模型上，VoiceMark的水印检测准确率超过95%，显著优于现有方法的50%。

Conclusion: VoiceMark是首个适用于零样本VC场景的水印方法，具有高准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Voice cloning (VC)-resistant watermarking is an emerging technique for
tracing and preventing unauthorized cloning. Existing methods effectively trace
traditional VC models by training them on watermarked audio but fail in
zero-shot VC scenarios, where models synthesize audio from an audio prompt
without training. To address this, we propose VoiceMark, the first zero-shot
VC-resistant watermarking method that leverages speaker-specific latents as the
watermark carrier, allowing the watermark to transfer through the zero-shot VC
process into the synthesized audio. Additionally, we introduce VC-simulated
augmentations and VAD-based loss to enhance robustness against distortions.
Experiments on multiple zero-shot VC models demonstrate that VoiceMark achieves
over 95% accuracy in watermark detection after zero-shot VC synthesis,
significantly outperforming existing methods, which only reach around 50%. See

TL;DR: 论文提出音乐源修复（MSR）任务，填补了理想化源分离与真实音乐制作之间的差距，并发布了RawStems数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音乐源分离（MSS）方法假设混合物是简单源信号之和，忽略了音乐制作中的信号退化（如均衡、压缩、混响）。MSR旨在恢复原始未退化的信号。

Method: MSR将混合物建模为退化源信号的退化总和，提出U-Former作为基线方法，并利用RawStems数据集（包含578首歌的未处理源信号）进行实验。

Result: 实验表明MSR在RawStems数据集上可行，并公开了数据集、退化模拟管道、训练代码和预训练模型。

Conclusion: MSR任务和RawStems数据集的提出为音乐信号处理提供了新方向，公开资源将促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Music Source Restoration (MSR), a novel task addressing the gap
between idealized source separation and real-world music production. Current
Music Source Separation (MSS) approaches assume mixtures are simple sums of
sources, ignoring signal degradations employed during music production like
equalization, compression, and reverb. MSR models mixtures as degraded sums of
individually degraded sources, with the goal of recovering original, undegraded
signals. Due to the lack of data for MSR, we present RawStems, a dataset
annotation of 578 songs with unprocessed source signals organized into 8
primary and 17 secondary instrument groups, totaling 354.13 hours. To the best
of our knowledge, RawStems is the first dataset that contains unprocessed music
stems with hierarchical categories. We consider spectral filtering, dynamic
range compression, harmonic distortion, reverb and lossy codec as possible
degradations, and establish U-Former as a baseline method, demonstrating the
feasibility of MSR on our dataset. We release the RawStems dataset annotations,
degradation simulation pipeline, training code and pre-trained models to be
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PTTM在噪声环境中的表现，以提升人机交互的自然性。

Method: 分析PTTM在不同噪声类型下的表现，并训练多模态PTTM（结合视觉特征）。

Result: PTTM在噪声中性能下降（从84%降至52%），多模态PTTM在10 dB音乐噪声中达到72%准确率。

Conclusion: 多模态PTTM优于纯音频模型，但泛化能力有限；训练依赖准确转录，限制了ASR的应用。

Abstract: Accurate predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) are essential for naturalistic
human-robot interaction. However, little is known about their performance in
noise. This study therefore explores PTTM performance in types of noise likely
to be encountered once deployed. Our analyses reveal PTTMs are highly sensitive
to noise. Hold/shift accuracy drops from 84% in clean speech to just 52% in 10
dB music noise. Training with noisy data enables a multimodal PTTM, which
includes visual features to better exploit visual cues, with 72% accuracy in 10
dB music noise. The multimodal PTTM outperforms the audio-only PTTM across all
noise types and SNRs, highlighting its ability to exploit visual cues; however,
this does not always generalise to new types of noise. Analysis also reveals
that successful training relies on accurate transcription, limiting the use of
ASR-derived transcriptions to clean conditions. We make code publicly available
for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试难以全面评估听力损失对语音理解的功能影响，尤其是在老年性耳聋等情况下。

Method: 利用ASR模拟中度倾斜听力损失的感知效果，通过控制语音刺激的声学退化并分析音素级混淆模式。

Result: 模拟听力损失导致特定的音素混淆（如高频辅音的替换和删除），测试电池在模拟中有效区分正常听力和听力受损者。

Conclusion: ASR方法为开发客观、精细和频率特异性的听力评估工具提供了新途径，未来将验证人类参与者并探索AI模型的集成。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often fails to fully characterize the functional
impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly supra-threshold
deficits and frequency-specific perception challenges in conditions like
presbycusis. This paper presents the development and simulated evaluation of a
novel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-based frequency-specific speech test
designed to provide granular diagnostic insights. Our approach leverages ASR to
simulate the perceptual effects of moderate sloping hearing loss by processing
speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation and subsequently analyzing
phoneme-level confusion patterns. Key findings indicate that simulated hearing
loss introduces specific phoneme confusions, predominantly affecting
high-frequency consonants (e.g., alveolar/palatal to labiodental substitutions)
and leading to significant phoneme deletions, consistent with the acoustic cues
degraded in presbycusis. A test battery curated from these ASR-derived
confusions demonstrated diagnostic value, effectively differentiating between
simulated normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in a comprehensive
simulation. This ASR-driven methodology offers a promising avenue for
developing objective, granular, and frequency-specific hearing assessment tools
that complement traditional audiometry. Future work will focus on validating
these findings with human participants and exploring the integration of
advanced AI models for enhanced diagnostic precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音模型实际使用的上下文长度（有效上下文），以优化模型性能和应用。

Method: 提出两种测量有效上下文的方法，并应用于不同语音Transformer模型。

Result: 监督模型的有效上下文与任务性质相关，自监督模型的有效上下文主要在早期层增加且较短。

Conclusion: HuBERT可在不修改架构或微调的情况下以流模式运行，因其预测时无需长上下文。

Abstract: Modern neural speech models benefit from having longer context, and many
approaches have been proposed to increase the maximum context a model can use.
However, few have attempted to measure how much context these models actually
use, i.e., the effective context. Here, we propose two approaches to measuring
the effective context, and use them to analyze different speech Transformers.
For supervised models, we find that the effective context correlates well with
the nature of the task, with fundamental frequency tracking, phone
classification, and word classification requiring increasing amounts of
effective context. For self-supervised models, we find that effective context
increases mainly in the early layers, and remains relatively short -- similar
to the supervised phone model. Given that these models do not use a long
context during prediction, we show that HuBERT can be run in streaming mode
without modification to the architecture and without further fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 呼吸音数据集规模和质量有限，导致高性能难以实现，而集成模型虽有效但推理成本高。

Method: 采用软标签训练和知识蒸馏，将多个教师模型的知识传递给学生模型，探索不同变体。

Result: 在ICHBI上达到64.39的新最高分，超越之前最佳0.85分，平均分提升超过1.16。

Conclusion: 软标签知识蒸馏对呼吸音分类有效，不受模型大小或架构限制。

Abstract: Respiratory sound datasets are limited in size and quality, making high
performance difficult to achieve. Ensemble models help but inevitably increase
compute cost at inference time. Soft label training distills knowledge
efficiently with extra cost only at training. In this study, we explore soft
labels for respiratory sound classification as an architecture-agnostic
approach to distill an ensemble of teacher models into a student model. We
examine different variations of our approach and find that even a single
teacher, identical to the student, considerably improves performance beyond its
own capability, with optimal gains achieved using only a few teachers. We
achieve the new state-of-the-art Score of 64.39 on ICHBI, surpassing the
previous best by 0.85 and improving average Scores across architectures by more
than 1.16. Our results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge distillation
with soft labels for respiratory sound classification, regardless of size or
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在音频生成中表现优异但推理速度慢，修正流方法虽提升速度但需从头训练且低步数下性能不佳。

Method: 提出AudioTurbo，利用预训练TTA模型生成确定性噪声样本对，学习一阶ODE路径。

Result: 在AudioCaps数据集上，仅需10步采样即优于现有模型，推理步数降至3步。

Conclusion: AudioTurbo有效结合预训练模型与修正扩散方法，显著提升生成效率与性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly improved the quality and diversity of
audio generation but are hindered by slow inference speed. Rectified flow
enhances inference speed by learning straight-line ordinary differential
equation (ODE) paths. However, this approach requires training a flow-matching
model from scratch and tends to perform suboptimally, or even poorly, at low
step counts. To address the limitations of rectified flow while leveraging the
advantages of advanced pre-trained diffusion models, this study integrates
pre-trained models with the rectified diffusion method to improve the
efficiency of text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Specifically, we propose
AudioTurbo, which learns first-order ODE paths from deterministic noise sample
pairs generated by a pre-trained TTA model. Experiments on the AudioCaps
dataset demonstrate that our model, with only 10 sampling steps, outperforms
prior models and reduces inference to 3 steps compared to a flow-matching-based
acceleration model.

TL;DR: 论文开发并评估了七个语音质量维度的模型，展示了其在多种语音任务中的强泛化能力和零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过语音质量维度描述非典型语音和其他语音调制特征，以提升语音相关任务的实用性。

Method: 利用预训练模型的嵌入特征，在公共Speech Accessibility项目数据集上训练探针模型。

Result: 模型在SAP数据集中表现优异，并在未见过的语言和任务（如意大利语非典型语音和情感语音）中展示了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 语音质量维度在语音风格相关任务中具有实用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Perceptual voice quality dimensions describe key characteristics of atypical
speech and other speech modulations. Here we develop and evaluate voice quality
models for seven voice and speech dimensions (intelligibility, imprecise
consonants, harsh voice, naturalness, monoloudness, monopitch, and
breathiness). Probes were trained on the public Speech Accessibility (SAP)
project dataset with 11,184 samples from 434 speakers, using embeddings from
frozen pre-trained models as features. We found that our probes had both strong
performance and strong generalization across speech elicitation categories in
the SAP dataset. We further validated zero-shot performance on additional
datasets, encompassing unseen languages and tasks: Italian atypical speech,
English atypical speech, and affective speech. The strong zero-shot performance
and the interpretability of results across an array of evaluations suggests the
utility of using voice quality dimensions in speaking style-related tasks.

Motivation: 解决语音基础模型压缩中参数冗余和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 采用紧凑的层级自压缩门和细粒度神经元剪枝，结合无压缩模型联合训练。

Result: 在LibriSpeech-100hr上，wav2vec2.0-base和HuBERT-large参数分别减少65%和60%，WER无显著增加，且压缩时间减少25%。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效压缩模型的同时保持了性能优势，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for speech foundation models compression
that tightly integrates model pruning and parameter update into a single stage.
Highly compact layer-level tied self-pinching gates each containing only a
single learnable threshold are jointly trained with uncompressed models and
used in fine-grained neuron level pruning. Experiments conducted on the
LibriSpeech-100hr corpus suggest that our approach reduces the number of
parameters of wav2vec2.0-base and HuBERT-large models by 65% and 60%
respectively, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate
(WER) increase on the test-clean dataset. Compared to previously published
methods on the same task, our approach not only achieves the lowest WER of
7.05% on the test-clean dataset under a comparable model compression ratio of
4.26x, but also operates with at least 25% less model compression time.

TL;DR: RepoMaster是一个自主代理框架，旨在通过探索和重用GitHub仓库解决复杂任务，显著提升了任务完成率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务需要完整的代码仓库而非简单脚本，但现有框架难以有效利用GitHub资源，主要障碍是信息过载和依赖关系复杂。

Method: RepoMaster构建函数调用图、模块依赖图及分层代码树，识别核心组件，并通过探索工具逐步优化上下文使用。

Result: 在MLE-bench上，RepoMaster比基线OpenHands提升了110%的有效提交；在GitTaskBench上，任务通过率从24.1%提升至62.9%，同时减少95%的token使用。

Conclusion: RepoMaster通过高效利用GitHub资源，显著提升了代码代理解决复杂任务的能力。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously.
Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code
generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories
rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a
major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of
open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular
components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and
SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources.
Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper
exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled
dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows
of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous
agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving
complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call
graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify
essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs
rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it
progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and
prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted
MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over
the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench,
RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 24.1% to 62.9% while reducing token
usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at
https://github.com/wanghuacan/RepoMaster.

operations. To address this issue, we present GitGoodBench, a novel benchmark
for evaluating AI agent performance on VCS tasks. GitGoodBench covers three
core Git scenarios extracted from permissive open-source Python, Java, and
Kotlin repositories. Our benchmark provides three datasets: a comprehensive
evaluation suite (900 samples), a rapid prototyping version (120 samples), and
a training corpus (17,469 samples). We establish baseline performance on the
prototyping version of our benchmark using GPT-4o equipped with custom tools,
achieving a 21.11% solve rate overall. We expect GitGoodBench to serve as a
crucial stepping stone toward truly comprehensive SE agents that go beyond mere

*Mathew J. Walter,Aaron Barrett,Kimberly Tam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DFCR的方法，通过多输入和数据融合增强AI系统的抗对抗攻击能力，显著提升了海上自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性AI攻击对依赖AI的自主运输系统构成重大威胁，传统防御方法范围有限，安全指标不足，需要更强的韧性。

Method: 提出DFCR方法，利用多输入和数据融合构建防御组件，并开发AI安全指标。通过实际演示和定量分析评估其效果。

Result: DFCR方法显著提升了抗攻击能力，对抗多角度扰动攻击的损失减少35%，对抗补丁攻击和欺骗攻击的损失减少100%。

Conclusion: DFCR方法为开发更安全、更具韧性的AI系统提供了新途径，尤其在对抗性攻击环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI) attacks pose a significant threat to
autonomous transportation, such as maritime vessels, that rely on AI
components. Malicious actors can exploit these systems to deceive and
manipulate AI-driven operations. This paper addresses three critical research
challenges associated with adversarial AI: the limited scope of traditional
defences, inadequate security metrics, and the need to build resilience beyond
model-level defences. To address these challenges, we propose building defences
utilising multiple inputs and data fusion to create defensive components and an
AI security metric as a novel approach toward developing more secure AI
systems. We name this approach the Data Fusion Cyber Resilience (DFCR) method,
and we evaluate it through real-world demonstrations and comprehensive
quantitative analyses, comparing a system built with the DFCR method against
single-input models and models utilising existing state-of-the-art defences.
The findings show that the DFCR approach significantly enhances resilience
against adversarial machine learning attacks in maritime autonomous system
operations, achieving up to a 35\% reduction in loss for successful
multi-pronged perturbation attacks, up to a 100\% reduction in loss for
successful adversarial patch attacks and up to 100\% reduction in loss for
successful spoofing attacks when using these more resilient systems. We
demonstrate how DFCR and DFCR confidence scores can reduce adversarial AI
contact confidence and improve decision-making by the system, even when typical
adversarial defences have been compromised. Ultimately, this work contributes
to the development of more secure and resilient AI-driven systems against
adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文介绍了VideoMarkBench，首个系统性评估视频水印在去除和伪造攻击下鲁棒性的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频生成模型的快速发展，合成视频的真实性引发伦理问题，现有视频水印方法的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过统一数据集（三种视频生成模型生成，三种视频风格）和四种水印方法，评估12种扰动类型在不同威胁模型下的表现。

Result: 研究发现当前水印方法存在显著漏洞，亟需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Conclusion: VideoMarkBench揭示了现有水印技术的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The rapid development of video generative models has led to a surge in highly
realistic synthetic videos, raising ethical concerns related to disinformation
and copyright infringement. Recently, video watermarking has been proposed as a
mitigation strategy by embedding invisible marks into AI-generated videos to
enable subsequent detection. However, the robustness of existing video
watermarking methods against both common and adversarial perturbations remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMarkBench, the first systematic
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of video watermarks under
watermark removal and watermark forgery attacks. Our study encompasses a
unified dataset generated by three state-of-the-art video generative models,
across three video styles, incorporating four watermarking methods and seven
aggregation strategies used during detection. We comprehensively evaluate 12
types of perturbations under white-box, black-box, and no-box threat models.
Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in current watermarking
approaches and highlight the urgent need for more robust solutions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/zhengyuan-jiang/VideoMarkBench.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在同行评审中使用大语言模型（LLM）的可行性，并提出了一种基于主题的水印技术（TBW）来检测LLM生成的文本，以维护评审过程的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作中的应用增加，其在同行评审中的使用仍被禁止，主要因保密性、内容幻觉和评价不一致等问题。需要一种可靠的归属机制来确保评审的公正性。

Method: 研究评估了主题水印技术（TBW），这是一种轻量级、语义感知的方法，用于在LLM生成的文本中嵌入可检测信号。实验覆盖多种LLM配置，并使用真实同行评审数据。

Result: 结果显示，TBW在保持评审质量的同时，对基于改写的规避表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TBW是一种低干扰且实用的解决方案，可用于在同行评审中规范LLM的使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic
workflows, with many conferences and journals permitting their use for tasks
such as language refinement and literature summarization. However, their use in
peer review remains prohibited due to concerns around confidentiality breaches,
hallucinated content, and inconsistent evaluations. As LLM-generated text
becomes more indistinguishable from human writing, there is a growing need for
reliable attribution mechanisms to preserve the integrity of the review
process. In this work, we evaluate topic-based watermarking (TBW), a
lightweight, semantic-aware technique designed to embed detectable signals into
LLM-generated text. We conduct a comprehensive assessment across multiple LLM
configurations, including base, few-shot, and fine-tuned variants, using
authentic peer review data from academic conferences. Our results show that TBW
maintains review quality relative to non-watermarked outputs, while
demonstrating strong robustness to paraphrasing-based evasion. These findings
highlight the viability of TBW as a minimally intrusive and practical solution
for enforcing LLM usage in peer review.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于无监督自编码器的方法，用于检测IoV网络中的未知攻击，通过加权重建和三重边际损失训练模型，在实验中表现出高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoV系统的高度互联性带来了显著的安全漏洞，传统安全机制难以应对复杂的数据和攻击，因此需要一种新的检测方法。

Method: 采用无监督自编码器，结合加权重建和三重边际损失训练，生成良性数据的多样化表示，用于检测未知攻击。

Result: 实验表明，该方法对未知攻击类型的检测准确率高达97%-100%，对良性数据的准确率为99%，且具备跨领域适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法在IoV网络安全中表现出高效性和适应性，为复杂攻击检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, while offering significant advancements
in transportation efficiency and safety, introduce substantial security
vulnerabilities due to their highly interconnected nature. These dynamic
systems produce massive amounts of data between vehicles, infrastructure, and
cloud services and present a highly distributed framework with a wide attack
surface. In considering network-centered attacks on IoV systems, attacks such
as Denial-of-Service (DoS) can prohibit the communication of essential physical
traffic safety information between system elements, illustrating that the
security concerns for these systems go beyond the traditional confidentiality,
integrity, and availability concerns of enterprise systems. Given the
complexity and volume of data generated by IoV systems, traditional security
mechanisms are often inadequate for accurately detecting sophisticated and
evolving cyberattacks. Here, we present an unsupervised autoencoder method
trained entirely on benign network data for the purpose of unseen attack
detection in IoV networks. We leverage a weighted combination of reconstruction
and triplet margin loss to guide the autoencoder training and develop a diverse
representation of the benign training set. We conduct extensive experiments on
recent network intrusion datasets from two different application domains,
industrial IoT and home IoT, that represent the modern IoV task. We show that
our method performs robustly for all unseen attack types, with roughly 99%
accuracy on benign data and between 97% and 100% performance on anomaly data.
We extend these results to show that our model is adaptable through the use of
transfer learning, achieving similarly high results while leveraging domain
features from one domain to another.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TIM的通用防御框架，能够自适应地抵御多种越狱攻击，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法通常针对特定类型的越狱攻击，无法应对多样化的对抗策略，因此需要一种更通用的防御方案。

Method: TIM通过训练一个关键令牌进行高效检测，并在推理时识别越狱行为；随后使用检测到的越狱指令与拒绝回答进行安全微调。为避免检测器性能下降，微调过程与检测模块解耦。

Result: 在大型语言模型和多模态语言模型上的广泛实验表明，TIM能够有效防御多种越狱攻击。

Conclusion: TIM作为一种自适应的通用防御框架，显著提升了模型对多样化越狱攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: While (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread
attention due to their exceptional capabilities, they remain vulnerable to
jailbreak attacks. Various defense methods are proposed to defend against
jailbreak attacks, however, they are often tailored to specific types of
jailbreak attacks, limiting their effectiveness against diverse adversarial
strategies. For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text
adversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time
IMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak
attacks in a self-evolving way. Specifically, TIM initially trains a gist token
for efficient detection, which it subsequently applies to detect jailbreak
activities during inference. When jailbreak attempts are identified, TIM
implements safety fine-tuning using the detected jailbreak instructions paired
with refusal answers. Furthermore, to mitigate potential performance
degradation in the detector caused by parameter updates during safety
fine-tuning, we decouple the fine-tuning process from the detection module.
Extensive experiments on both LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrate the efficacy
of TIM.

TL;DR: 论文提出SimProcess框架，通过机器学习评估ICS模拟的真实性，提升蜜罐的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICS蜜罐难以模拟真实物理过程，易被攻击者识破，需提高模拟保真度以增强防御。

Method: 提出SimProcess框架，利用随机森林等模型估计噪声分布，仅需真实系统的时间序列数据。

Result: 在电力网格案例中，模型召回率达1.0，确定高斯和高斯混合分布为最佳模拟方法。

Conclusion: SimProcess能有效提升蜜罐模拟的真实性，适用于复杂动态系统，代码已开源。

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power
grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations,
causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example,
undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake.
ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed
to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive
mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS
physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating
the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors
produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.
  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity
of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy
physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by
estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random
Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or
are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of
measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of
complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a
case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare
the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative
noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of
up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best
distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution
provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot
fidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.

Result: 女性中神经递质运输和线粒体应激反应基因显著，男性中免疫和炎症相关基因占主导。共享基因如GMNC和OSTN在神经结构维持中起核心作用。

Conclusion: 性别分层研究对衰老研究至关重要，并提供了针对年龄相关认知衰退的潜在遗传靶点。

Abstract: Brain aging trajectories differ between males and females, yet the genetic
factors underlying these differences remain underexplored. Using structural MRI
and genotyping data from 40,940 UK Biobank participants (aged 45-83), we
computed Brain Age Gap Estimates (BrainAGE) for total brain, hippocampal, and
ventricular volumes. We conducted sex-stratified genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and Post-GWAS analyses to identify genetic variants associated
with accelerated brain aging. Distinct gene sets emerged by sex: in females,
neurotransmitter transport and mitochondrial stress response genes were
implicated; in males, immune and inflammation-related genes dominated. Shared
genes, including GMNC and OSTN, were consistently linked to brain volumes
across sexes, suggesting core roles in neurostructural maintenance. Tissue
expression analyses revealed sex-specific enrichment in pathways tied to
neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the importance of sex-stratified
approaches in aging research and suggest genetic targets for personalized
interventions against age-related cognitive decline.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在动态复杂交通环境中需要更准确的轨迹预测，传统方法依赖静态图结构，无法充分捕捉车辆间的动态交互。

Method: HiT采用动态框架，结合行为感知模块和动态中心性度量，捕捉车辆间的直接和间接交互。

Result: 在多个真实数据集（NGSIM、HighD等）上，HiT表现优于其他模型，尤其在激进驾驶行为场景中。

Conclusion: HiT为轨迹预测提供了更可靠和可解释的方法，有助于提升自动驾驶系统的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of
autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic
environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory
Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by
incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike
traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT
leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect
interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the
subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more
accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we
conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world
datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results
demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple
metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving
behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory
prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing
the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的边缘设备提供了实时LLM和VLM应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable various applications on edge devices such
as smartphones, wearables, and embodied robots. However, their deployment often
depends on expensive cloud-based APIs, creating high operational costs, which
limit access for smaller organizations and raise sustainability concerns.
Certain LLMs can be deployed on-device, offering a cost-effective solution with
reduced latency and improved privacy. Yet, limited computing resources
constrain the size and accuracy of models that can be deployed, necessitating a
collaborative design between edge and cloud. We propose a fast and
cost-effective speculative edge-cloud decoding framework with a large target
model on the server and a small draft model on the device. By introducing early
exits in the target model, tokens are generated mid-verification, allowing the
client to preemptively draft subsequent tokens before final verification, thus
utilizing idle time and enhancing parallelism between edge and cloud. Using an
NVIDIA Jetson Nano (client) and an A100 GPU (server) with Vicuna-68M (draft)
and Llama2-7B (target) models, our method achieves up to a 35% reduction in
latency compared to cloud-based autoregressive decoding, with an additional 11%
improvement from preemptive drafting. To demonstrate real-world applicability,
we deploy our method on the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot using Vision-Language
Model (VLM) based control, achieving a 21% speedup over traditional cloud-based
autoregressive decoding. These results demonstrate the potential of our
framework for real-time LLM and VLM applications on resource-constrained edge
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏细粒度机器人操作任务的大规模数据集，尤其是带有部件级标注和指令的数据集，限制了模型在部件级任务中的表现。

Method: 提出了PartInstruct数据集，包含部件级标注的3D对象实例和任务，并通过模拟器生成了10,000多个专家演示。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在部件概念理解和3D空间动作预测方面表现不佳，尤其在长时程任务中。

Conclusion: PartInstruct为细粒度机器人操作提供了重要基准，揭示了当前方法的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-grained robot manipulation, such as lifting and rotating a bottle to
display the label on the cap, requires robust reasoning about object parts and
their relationships with intended tasks. Despite recent advances in training
general-purpose robot manipulation policies guided by language instructions,
there is a notable lack of large-scale datasets for fine-grained manipulation
tasks with part-level instructions and diverse 3D object instances annotated
with part-level labels. In this work, we introduce PartInstruct, the first
large-scale benchmark for training and evaluating fine-grained robot
manipulation models using part-level instructions. PartInstruct comprises 513
object instances across 14 categories, each annotated with part-level
information, and 1302 fine-grained manipulation tasks organized into 16 task
classes. Our training set consists of over 10,000 expert demonstrations
synthesized in a 3D simulator, where each demonstration is paired with a
high-level task instruction, a chain of base part-based skill instructions, and
ground-truth 3D information about the object and its parts. Additionally, we
designed a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the generalizability of learned
policies across new states, objects, and tasks. We evaluated several
state-of-the-art robot manipulation approaches, including end-to-end
vision-language policy learning and bi-level planning models for robot
manipulation on our benchmark. The experimental results reveal that current
models struggle to robustly ground part concepts and predict actions in 3D
space, and face challenges when manipulating object parts in long-horizon
tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散/流匹配策略计算成本高，需等待完整采样后才能执行动作，限制了实时性。

Method: 算法从最后动作的窄高斯分布采样，逐步积分流匹配学习的速度场，生成动作序列。

Result: 该方法支持实时动作流传输，保持多模态行为建模能力，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 流式流策略提高了策略执行速度和传感器-运动闭环效率，适用于基于学习的机器人控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation
learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are
computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a
diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate
action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before
any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies
by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from
pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last
action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow
matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory.
This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow
sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution.
Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal
behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to
reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming
flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution
and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control. Project

Conclusion: BLADE为长时程机器人操作提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Behavior from Language and Demonstration (BLADE), a framework
for long-horizon robotic manipulation by integrating imitation learning and
model-based planning. BLADE leverages language-annotated demonstrations,
extracts abstract action knowledge from large language models (LLMs), and
constructs a library of structured, high-level action representations. These
representations include preconditions and effects grounded in visual perception
for each high-level action, along with corresponding controllers implemented as
neural network-based policies. BLADE can recover such structured
representations automatically, without manually labeled states or symbolic
definitions. BLADE shows significant capabilities in generalizing to novel
situations, including novel initial states, external state perturbations, and
novel goals. We validate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation
and on real robots with a diverse set of objects with articulated parts,
partial observability, and geometric constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端VLA系统在微调时会丢失VLM的关键能力，因此需要一种既能继承VLM知识又能实现机器人任务可操作推理的通用模型。

Method: 提出ChatVLA-2，采用混合专家模型和三阶段训练流程，保留VLM的开放世界推理能力并实现动作推理。

Result: 模型在数学推理、OCR和空间推理任务中表现优异，超越现有模仿学习方法。

Conclusion: ChatVLA-2显著推进了具有强大推理能力的通用机器人基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as the next generation of
models in robotics. However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key
capabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks.
We argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's
core competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit
the knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize,
capable of solving math problems, possessing visual-spatial intelligence, 2)
Reasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into
actionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel
mixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized three-stage training
pipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling
actionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task
wherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks
corresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our
method exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities,
despite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning
skills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving
previously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and
comprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation
learning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero. This work represents a
substantial advancement toward developing truly generalizable robotic
foundation models endowed with robust reasoning capacities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭服务机器人在陌生环境中的自适应导航需要低层路径规划和高层场景理解，但现有视觉语言模型方法存在时空不连续性、记忆表示不足和任务理解不足的局限性。

Method: 提出DORAEMON框架，包含Dorsal Stream（处理时空不连续性）和Ventral Stream（提升决策能力），并开发Nav-Ensurance确保导航安全高效。

Result: 在HM3D、MP3D和GOAT数据集上，DORAEMON在成功率和路径长度加权成功率上均优于现有方法，并引入新评估指标AORI。

Conclusion: DORAEMON在无需预训练或地图构建的情况下，实现了零样本自主导航的高效性和安全性。

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household
service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path
planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model
(VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and
scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal
discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations,
and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose
DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory
Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of
Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The
Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology
Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines
RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops
Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON
on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL)
metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new
evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot
autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.

Result: 实验表明定位模块能减少控制误差，性能优于现有算法，并在真实嵌入式平台上验证。

Conclusion: MIND-Stack表现良好，未来可扩展更多模块以提升稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Developing robust, efficient navigation algorithms is challenging. Rule-based
methods offer interpretability and modularity but struggle with learning from
large datasets, while end-to-end neural networks excel in learning but lack
transparency and modularity. In this paper, we present MIND-Stack, a modular
software stack consisting of a localization network and a Stanley Controller
with intermediate human interpretable state representations and end-to-end
differentiability. Our approach enables the upstream localization module to
reduce the downstream control error, extending its role beyond state
estimation. Unlike existing research on differentiable algorithms that either
lack modules of the autonomous stack to span from sensor input to actuator
output or real-world implementation, MIND-Stack offers both capabilities. We
conduct experiments that demonstrate the ability of the localization module to
reduce the downstream control loss through its end-to-end differentiability
while offering better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms. We showcase
sim-to-real capabilities by deploying the algorithm on a real-world embedded
autonomous platform with limited computation power and demonstrate simultaneous
training of both the localization and controller towards one goal. While
MIND-Stack shows good results, we discuss the incorporation of additional
modules from the autonomous navigation pipeline in the future, promising even
greater stability and performance in the next iterations of the framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在连续机器人控制任务中面临探索不足和训练不稳定的问题，ReinFlow旨在通过改进流匹配策略来解决这些问题。

Method: ReinFlow通过注入可学习噪声到流策略的确定性路径中，将其转化为离散时间马尔可夫过程，便于精确计算似然。该方法支持多种流模型变体，如Rectified Flow和Shortcut Models。

Result: 在挑战性任务中，Rectified Flow策略的奖励平均增长135.36%，节省了82.63%的计算时间；Shortcut Model策略的成功率平均提高40.34%，节省23.20%的计算时间。

Conclusion: ReinFlow在连续机器人控制任务中表现出色，显著提升了性能并节省了计算资源。

Abstract: We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for
continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects
learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow
into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood
computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training
stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants,
including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very
few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative
locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual
input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained
an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged
locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate
of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved
an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or
even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM
policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%. Project

Motivation: 现实应用中，具身智能体需与不熟悉的智能体及人类用户协作，但用户目标常模糊且隐含，因此快速准确的需求对齐成为关键能力。

Method: 开发了HA-Desire仿真环境，结合LLM驱动的用户代理；提出FAMER框架，包括需求心理推理机制、反思式通信模块和目标相关信息提取与记忆持久化。

Result: 实验表明，FAMER显著提升了任务执行和沟通效率，使智能体能快速适应复杂环境中的用户需求。

Conclusion: FAMER框架为具身智能体在模糊指令和隐含需求场景下的高效协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex
physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution.
The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals
are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous
instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective
assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical
capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home
assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven human
user agent exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication.
The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the
user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for
fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning
mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We
further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant
inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory
persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances
both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to
quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.

Central to our approach is the integration of a dual LiDAR system, which
combines forward-facing and downward-angled LiDAR sensors to enable
comprehensive scene understanding, specifically tailored for industrial
material handling tasks. The dual configuration improves the detection and
segmentation of dynamic and static obstacles with high spatial precision. Using
high-resolution 3D point clouds captured from two sensors, our method employs a
lightweight yet robust approach that segments the point clouds into
safety-critical instance classes such as pedestrians, vehicles, and forklifts,
as well as environmental classes such as driveable ground, lanes, and

Conclusion: SCIZOR为模仿学习提供了一种高效的数据筛选方法，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Imitation learning advances robot capabilities by enabling the acquisition of
diverse behaviors from human demonstrations. However, large-scale datasets used
for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which
can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets
by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing
robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform
curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level,
failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address
this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that
filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of
imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of
low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable
actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns.
SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data
to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module
operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant
patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies
to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement
of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks. More information is available at:

Abstract: Network models have been widely used to study diverse systems and analyze
their dynamic behaviors. Given the structural variability of networks, an
intriguing question arises: Can we infer the type of system represented by a
network based on its structure? This classification problem involves extracting
relevant features from the network. Existing literature has proposed various
methods that combine structural measurements and dynamical processes for
feature extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to
characterize networks using statistics from random walks, which can be
particularly informative about network properties. We present the employed
statistical metrics and compare their performance on multiple datasets with
other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. Our results demonstrate that

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DSE方法在HLS设计优化中存在探索成本高和结果次优的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: iDSE利用LLM的设计质量感知能力，智能剪枝设计空间，并通过多路径优化提升设计质量和多样性。

Result: iDSE在接近参考Pareto前沿方面比启发式方法快5.1~16.6倍，仅需探索4.6%的设计即可匹配NSGA-II。

Conclusion: iDSE展示了LLM在HLS设计优化中的潜力，为多目标优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) serves as an agile hardware development tool that
streamlines the circuit design by abstracting the register transfer level into
behavioral descriptions, while allowing designers to customize the generated
microarchitectures through optimization directives. However, the combinatorial
explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design
space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting
heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal
design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and
suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first
LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to
effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design
space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs,
expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent
and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization,
iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE
methods by 5.1$\times$$\sim$16.6$\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto
front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs. Our work
demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS
design optimization, offering new insights into multiobjective optimization
challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渲染方法通常基于物理模拟，计算复杂且耗时。RenderFormer旨在通过序列到序列的转换简化渲染过程，提高效率。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：视图无关阶段建模三角形间光传输，视图相关阶段将光线束转换为像素值。基于Transformer架构，无强先验约束。

Result: 在形状和光传输复杂度不同的场景中进行了验证，展示了RenderFormer的有效性。

Conclusion: RenderFormer提供了一种高效、无需逐场景训练的渲染方法，为神经渲染开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present RenderFormer, a neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an
image from a triangle-based representation of a scene with full global
illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or
fine-tuning. Instead of taking a physics-centric approach to rendering, we
formulate rendering as a sequence-to-sequence transformation where a sequence
of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to a
sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer
follows a two stage pipeline: a view-independent stage that models
triangle-to-triangle light transport, and a view-dependent stage that
transforms a token representing a bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel
values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both
stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal
prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with

TL;DR: 比较了三种深度学习模型（CNN-LSTM、Transformer和BioSerenity-E1）在脑电图（EEG）正常与异常分类任务中的表现，结果显示预训练模型BioSerenity-E1表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EEG数据量大且需要专业知识，开发AI工具辅助分析是必要的。

Method: 在2,500个EEG记录上训练或微调三种模型，并在三个数据集上评估性能。

Result: BioSerenity-E1微调后在多个数据集上表现最佳，平衡准确率最高达94.63%。

Conclusion: 预训练模型能高效、稳健地分类EEG数据，减少资源需求并提高适用性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used by physicians for the diagnosis
of numerous neurological disorders. Due to the large volume of EEGs requiring
interpretation and the specific expertise involved, artificial
intelligence-based tools are being developed to assist in their visual
analysis. In this paper, we compare two deep learning models (CNN-LSTM and
Transformer-based) with BioSerenity-E1, a recently proposed foundation model,
in the task of classifying entire EEG recordings as normal or abnormal. The
three models were trained or finetuned on 2,500 EEG recordings and their
performances were evaluated on two private and one public datasets: a large
multicenter dataset annotated by a single specialist (dataset A composed of n =
4,480 recordings), a small multicenter dataset annotated by three specialists
(dataset B, n = 198), and the Temple University Abnormal (TUAB) EEG corpus
evaluation dataset (n = 276). On dataset A, the three models achieved at least
86% balanced accuracy, with BioSerenity-E1 finetuned achieving the highest
balanced accuracy (89.19% [88.36-90.41]). BioSerenity-E1 finetuned also
achieved the best performance on dataset B, with 94.63% [92.32-98.12] balanced
accuracy. The models were then validated on TUAB evaluation dataset, whose
corresponding training set was not used during training, where they achieved at
least 76% accuracy. Specifically, BioSerenity-E1 finetuned outperformed the
other two models, reaching an accuracy of 82.25% [78.27-87.48]. Our results
highlight the usefulness of leveraging pre-trained models for automatic EEG
classification: enabling robust and efficient interpretation of EEG data with
fewer resources and broader applicability.

Motivation: 解决代理分组问题中团队规模受限的挑战，同时考虑代理的偏好，以提升分组的效率。

Method: 通过系统算法研究，提出多个精确算法（FPT），特别针对树状结构（有限树宽）和小规模团队设计了一种高效算法。

Result: 证明了所提算法在树状结构中的高效性，并表明其渐近最优，即在合理理论假设下无法大幅改进。

Conclusion: 该算法在团队规模受限的分组问题中具有实用价值，尤其在树状结构和小规模团队中表现优异。

Abstract: Imagine we want to split a group of agents into teams in the most
\emph{efficient} way, considering that each agent has their own preferences
about their teammates. This scenario is modeled by the extensively studied
\textsc{Coalition Formation} problem. Here, we study a version of this problem
where each team must additionally be of bounded size.
  We conduct a systematic algorithmic study, providing several intractability
results as well as multiple exact algorithms that scale well as the input grows
(FPT), which could prove useful in practice.
  Our main contribution is an algorithm that deals efficiently with tree-like
structures (bounded \emph{treewidth}) for ``small'' teams. We complement this
result by proving that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Particularly,
there can be no algorithm that vastly outperforms the one we present, under
reasonable theoretical assumptions, even when considering star-like structures
(bounded \emph{vertex cover number}).

Motivation: 近年来，机器学习技术被广泛应用于难以采样的系统模拟，但缺乏理论支持可能导致次优实现。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用Sequential Tempering方法，结合浅层MADE架构和Curie-Weiss模型，分析最优权重及梯度下降训练过程，并比较有无局部Metropolis Monte Carlo步骤的效果。

Result: 给出了最优权重的描述和梯度下降训练的理论预测，明确了Sequential Tempering的最佳应用方式。

Conclusion: 本研究为机器学习与蒙特卡洛采样的结合奠定了清晰的理论基础。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning
techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be
studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different
architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still
lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to
address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used
Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the
Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a
description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent
optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with
and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus
able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this
case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of
machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Abstract: Predicting the risk of developing breast cancer is an important clinical tool
to guide early intervention and tailoring personalized screening strategies.
Early risk models have limited performance and recently machine learning-based
analysis of mammogram images showed encouraging risk prediction effects. These
models however are limited to the use of a single exam or tend to overlook
nuanced breast tissue evolvement in spatial and temporal details of
longitudinal imaging exams that are indicative of breast cancer risk. In this
paper, we propose STA-Risk (Spatial and Temporal Asymmetry-based Risk
Prediction), a novel Transformer-based model that captures fine-grained
mammographic imaging evolution simultaneously from bilateral and longitudinal
asymmetries for breast cancer risk prediction. STA-Risk is innovative by the
side encoding and temporal encoding to learn spatial-temporal asymmetries,
regulated by a customized asymmetry loss. We performed extensive experiments
with two independent mammogram datasets and achieved superior performance than
four representative SOTA models for 1- to 5-year future risk prediction. Source
codes will be released upon publishing of the paper.

Conclusion: 该轻量级隐私保护框架为医疗AI协作开发提供了新途径，同时确保数据机密性。

Abstract: The automated generation of radiology reports from chest X-ray images holds
significant promise in enhancing diagnostic workflows while preserving patient
privacy. Traditional centralized approaches often require sensitive data
transfer, posing privacy concerns. To address this, the study proposes a
Multimodal Federated Learning framework for chest X-ray report generation using
the IU-Xray dataset. The system utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the
encoder and GPT-2 as the report generator, enabling decentralized training
without sharing raw data. Three Federated Learning (FL) aggregation strategies:
FedAvg, Krum Aggregation and a novel Loss-aware Federated Averaging (L-FedAvg)
were evaluated. Among these, Krum Aggregation demonstrated superior performance
across lexical and semantic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore
and RaTEScore. The results show that FL can match or surpass centralized models
in generating clinically relevant and semantically rich radiology reports. This
lightweight and privacy-preserving framework paves the way for collaborative
medical AI development without compromising data confidentiality.

Method: 开发Digepath模型，采用双阶段迭代优化策略（预训练+精细筛查），基于超过353万个图像块和20万张H&E染色切片进行训练。

Conclusion: Digepath填补了病理学实践的关键空白，为AI驱动的精准病理学提供了可推广的范式。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden,
necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes.
Conventional histopathological diagnosis, heavily reliant on the subjective
interpretation of pathologists, suffers from limited reproducibility and
diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations and address the lack of
pathology-specific foundation models for GI diseases, we develop Digepath, a
specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a
dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with
fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely
distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on more
than 353 million image patches from over 200,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained
slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34
tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, molecular
prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation, particularly in
diagnostically ambiguous cases and resolution-agnostic tissue classification.We
further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and
achieve near-perfect 99.6% sensitivity across 9 independent medical
institutions nationwide. The outstanding performance of Digepath highlights its
potential to bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice. This work not
only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also
establishes a transferable paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.

Motivation: 解决Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)在处理高维特征时性能提升有限且计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出TaylorKAN，采用泰勒展开作为可学习激活函数，结合网络深度减少和特征维度压缩。

Result: 在五个数据库上实验表明，TaylorKAN性能优于其他KAN相关模型，验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: TaylorKAN是一种高效且鲁棒的高维分数回归模型，局部逼近比全局逼近更有效。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has attracted growing interest for its strong
function approximation capability. In our previous work, KAN and its variants
were explored in score regression for blind image quality assessment (BIQA).
However, these models encounter challenges when processing high-dimensional
features, leading to limited performance gains and increased computational
cost. To address these issues, we propose TaylorKAN that leverages the Taylor
expansions as learnable activation functions to enhance local approximation
capability. To improve the computational efficiency, network depth reduction
and feature dimensionality compression are integrated into the TaylorKAN-based
score regression pipeline. On five databases (BID, CLIVE, KonIQ, SPAQ, and
FLIVE) with authentic distortions, extensive experiments demonstrate that
TaylorKAN consistently outperforms the other KAN-related models, indicating
that the local approximation via Taylor expansions is more effective than
global approximation using orthogonal functions. Its generalization capacity is
validated through inter-database experiments. The findings highlight the
potential of TaylorKAN as an efficient and robust model for high-dimensional
score regression.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型（如ResNet50）在皮肤癌分类中计算开销大，难以在资源受限环境中部署。

Method: 设计了一种自定义CNN模型，大幅减少参数和FLOPs。

Result: 模型参数减少96.7%，FLOPs大幅降低，分类精度偏差小于0.022%。

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在资源受限环境中更具实用性，为移动和边缘设备提供了可行的皮肤癌诊断方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning in medical image analysis has greatly
enhanced the accuracy of skin cancer classification. However, current
state-of-the-art models, especially those based on transfer learning like
ResNet50, come with significant computational overhead, rendering them
impractical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This study
proposes a custom CNN model that achieves a 96.7\% reduction in parameters
(from 23.9 million in ResNet50 to 692,000) while maintaining a classification
accuracy deviation of less than 0.022\%. Our empirical analysis of the HAM10000
dataset reveals that although transfer learning models provide a marginal
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.022\%, they result in a staggering
13,216.76\% increase in FLOPs, considerably raising computational costs and
inference latency. In contrast, our lightweight CNN architecture, which
encompasses only 30.04 million FLOPs compared to ResNet50's 4.00 billion,
significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and inference time.
These findings underscore the trade-off between the complexity of deep models
and their real-world feasibility, positioning our optimized CNN as a practical
solution for mobile and edge-based skin cancer diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG到ECG的重建任务具有挑战性，尤其是如何准确捕捉细粒度波形特征。

Method: 采用四通道信号图像表示（原始PPG、一阶差分、二阶差分和曲线下面积），结合ViT的自注意力机制，捕捉PPG的时空和生理变化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有1D卷积方法，PRD降低29%，RMSE降低15%，并在其他评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 多通道信号图像表示与ViT的结合为PPG到ECG的重建提供了更有效的方法，并为循环信号分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent
advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG
reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a
key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction
method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a
four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its
first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This
multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal
and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention
mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and
intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29%
reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces
improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and
effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a
clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including
QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude
difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal
image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more
effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of
beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the
potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our
approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely
focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a
general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus
on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device
deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel
optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using
iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order
algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for
controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model
composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs.
Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach
outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including
scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work
establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to
retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为3D超声重建提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，能够量化重建不确定性并提高异常数据的召回率。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of
anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces the
reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more
accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving
automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high
volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D
diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue
harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image
quality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging
unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of
transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full
3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of
elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation
techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound
reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion
models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare
both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a
3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction
consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task
performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal
consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the
robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of
diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and
demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic
anomalies under strong subsampling.

Research shows data-driven approaches help VC firms reduce bias and improve
decision-making. Machine learning models have outperformed human investors in
deal screening, helping identify high-potential startups. Incorporating AI
aimed to ensure more equitable and objective evaluations.
  The methodology included three phases: initial AI review, semi-finals judged
by humans, and finals using a hybrid weighting. In phase one, 57 applications
were scored by an AI tool built with StackAI and OpenAI's GPT-4o, and the top
36 advanced. In the semi-finals, human judges, unaware of AI scores, evaluated
startups on team quality, market potential, and technological innovation. Each
score - human or AI - was weighted equally, resulting in 75 percent human and
25 percent AI influence. In the finals, with five human judges, weighting
shifted to 83.3 percent human and 16.7 percent AI. There was a moderate
positive correlation between AI and human scores - Spearman's = 0.47 -
indicating general alignment with key differences. Notably, the final four
startups, selected mainly by humans, were among those rated highest by the AI.
This highlights the complementary nature of AI and human judgment. The study
shows that hybrid models can streamline and improve startup assessments. The
ClimaTech approach offers a strong framework for future competitions by
combining human expertise with AI capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文主张将验证作为AI监管的核心支柱，替代传统的可解释性，提出基于有效性和可解释性的分类法，并设计了一个前瞻性政策框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在关键领域的应用日益增多，但其不透明性导致监管挑战，传统的可解释性方法不足以应对。

Method: 提出基于有效性和可解释性的分类法，比较分析多国监管方法，设计以验证为中心的政策框架。

Result: 验证能提升社会信任、公平性和安全性，尤其在可解释性受限的高风险场景中。

Conclusion: 验证为中心的政策框架能平衡创新与责任，为高性能但不透明的AI系统提供治理路径。

Abstract: Artificial Knowledge (AK) systems are transforming decision-making across
critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However,
their growing opacity presents governance challenges that current regulatory
approaches, focused predominantly on explainability, fail to address
adequately. This article argues for a shift toward validation as a central
regulatory pillar. Validation, ensuring the reliability, consistency, and
robustness of AI outputs, offers a more practical, scalable, and risk-sensitive
alternative to explainability, particularly in high-stakes contexts where
interpretability may be technically or economically unfeasible. We introduce a
typology based on two axes, validity and explainability, classifying AK systems
into four categories and exposing the trade-offs between interpretability and
output reliability. Drawing on comparative analysis of regulatory approaches in
the EU, US, UK, and China, we show how validation can enhance societal trust,
fairness, and safety even where explainability is limited. We propose a
forward-looking policy framework centered on pre- and post-deployment
validation, third-party auditing, harmonized standards, and liability
incentives. This framework balances innovation with accountability and provides
a governance roadmap for responsibly integrating opaque, high-performing AK
systems into society.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在电气工程特定问题上的不足，提供个性化学习支持。

Method: 采用基于图的相似性度量、检索增强生成方法和并行Spice模拟，结合苏格拉底式对话。

Result: AITEE在领域知识应用上显著优于基线方法，中型LLM模型表现良好。

Conclusion: 代理式辅导系统在电气工程教育中具有规模化、个性化和高效学习的潜力。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems combined with large language models offer a
promising approach to address students' diverse needs and promote
self-efficacious learning. While large language models possess good
foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain
insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical
circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for
electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning
process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning.
AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit
reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel
graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture
materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel
Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies.
The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through
guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE
significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge
application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance.
Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable,
personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering
education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体是重要的信息传播平台，但数据获取困难且存在伦理问题，需要更可控的研究机制。

Method: 提出PDS平台，支持人机及机机对话研究，提供安全实验环境，并开源代码。

Result: PDS为研究者提供了安全的研究空间，支持AI行为理解和干预效果测试。

Conclusion: PDS是一个有效的工具，填补了社交媒体研究的空白，促进了对AI行为的理解。

Abstract: Social media serves as a primary communication and information dissemination
platform for major global events, entertainment, and niche or topically focused
community discussions. Therefore, it represents a valuable resource for
researchers who aim to understand numerous questions. However, obtaining data
can be difficult, expensive, and often unreliable due to the presence of bots,
fake accounts, and manipulated content. Additionally, there are ethical
concerns if researchers decide to conduct an online experiment without
explicitly notifying social media users about their intent. There is a need for
more controlled and scalable mechanisms to evaluate the impacts of digital
discussion interventions on audiences. We introduce the Public Discourse
Sandbox (PDS), which serves as a digital discourse research platform for
human-AI as well as AI-AI discourse research, testing, and training. PDS
provides a safe and secure space for research experiments that are not viable
on public, commercial social media platforms. Its main purpose is to enable the
understanding of AI behaviors and the impacts of customized AI participants via
techniques such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
and fine-tuning. We provide a hosted live version of the sandbox to support
researchers as well as the open-sourced code on GitHub for community
collaboration and contribution.

Conclusion: 将数字浪费纳入AI伦理框架，扩展了伦理考量范围，为生成式AI系统的全生命周期影响提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become widely adopted, they enable unprecedented
creation levels of synthetic data across text, images, audio, and video
modalities. While research has addressed the energy consumption of model
training and inference, a critical sustainability challenge remains
understudied: digital waste. This term refers to stored data that consumes
resources without serving a specific (and/or immediate) purpose. This paper
presents this terminology in the AI context and introduces digital waste as an
ethical imperative within (generative) AI development, positioning
environmental sustainability as core for responsible innovation. Drawing from
established digital resource management approaches, we examine how other
disciplines manage digital waste and identify transferable approaches for the
AI community. We propose specific recommendations encompassing re-search
directions, technical interventions, and cultural shifts to mitigate the
environmental consequences of in-definite data storage. By expanding AI ethics
beyond immediate concerns like bias and privacy to include inter-generational
environmental justice, this work contributes to a more comprehensive ethical
framework that considers the complete lifecycle impact of generative AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）对历史叙事传播的影响，特别是对大规模暴行记忆的再现。通过比较五种LLMs在四个历史案例中的表现，发现模型在广泛记录的事件（如大屠杀）中表现准确，但在较少记录的事件（如柬埔寨种族灭绝）中易受否认主义影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何影响历史记忆的传播，尤其是是否会导致记忆的扭曲或否认。

Method: 对五种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Llama、Mixtral和Gemini）进行对比审计，测试其在四个历史案例中的回答（包括否认主义主张）。

Result: LLMs在广泛记录的事件中表现准确，但在较少记录的事件中易受否认主义影响，显示训练数据对记忆完整性的影响。

Conclusion: LLMs虽扩展了“假体记忆”的概念，但未受监管的使用可能强化历史否认主义，引发伦理问题。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) can influence how
historical narratives are disseminated and perceived. This study explores the
implications of LLMs' responses on the representation of mass atrocity memory,
examining whether generative AI systems contribute to prosthetic memory, i.e.,
mediated experiences of historical events, or to what we term "prosthetic
denial," the AI-mediated erasure or distortion of atrocity memories. We argue
that LLMs function as interfaces that can elicit prosthetic memories and,
therefore, act as experiential sites for memory transmission, but also
introduce risks of denialism, particularly when their outputs align with
contested or revisionist narratives. To empirically assess these risks, we
conducted a comparative audit of five LLMs (Claude, GPT, Llama, Mixtral, and
Gemini) across four historical case studies: the Holodomor, the Holocaust, the
Cambodian Genocide, and the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. Each model
was prompted with questions addressing common denialist claims in English and
an alternative language relevant to each case (Ukrainian, German, Khmer, and
French). Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally produce accurate
responses for widely documented events like the Holocaust, significant
inconsistencies and susceptibility to denialist framings are observed for more
underrepresented cases like the Cambodian Genocide. The disparities highlight
the influence of training data availability and the probabilistic nature of LLM
responses on memory integrity. We conclude that while LLMs extend the concept
of prosthetic memory, their unmoderated use risks reinforcing historical
denialism, raising ethical concerns for (digital) memory preservation, and
potentially challenging the advantageous role of technology associated with the
original values of prosthetic memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代社会对有限原材料需求的增加，短期内无法解决碳排放问题，实现净零目标极具挑战性。循环经济（CE）范式被视为应对气候变化和关键材料供应不确定性的解决方案。

Method: 通过热力学材料网络的形式化方法，将DRL集成到材料循环设计中，并开发了基于Python的DRL算法库Stable-Baselines3的CiRL环境库。

Result: CiRL库具有专注于循环性、采用状态空间形式、基于Stable-Baselines3、并在Google Colaboratory中开发的特点，便于跨学科研究人员使用。

Conclusion: CiRL为循环经济研究提供了一个公开可用的DRL工具，有助于推动材料循环设计的创新。

Abstract: The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern
society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short
term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging
to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as
a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of
critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity
of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of
material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical
material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical
thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three
more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form,
which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control designs; it
is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely,
Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible
to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case
for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is publicly available.

Motivation: AI编程助手的广泛应用对编程教育的评估方式、学术诚信和技能发展提出了挑战，促使教育者寻找替代传统评分的方法。

Method: 研究在一个大型编程入门课程中实施了基于评分标准的匿名同伴评审，学生互评最终项目（2D游戏），并与教师评分进行相关性、平均绝对误差和均方根误差（RMSE）比较。同时，47个团队的反思调查分析了学生对公平性、评分行为和成绩汇总偏好的看法。

Result: 结果显示同伴评审能适度准确地近似教师评分，同时提升学生的参与度、评估思维和提供反馈的兴趣。

Conclusion: 研究为设计可扩展、可信赖的同伴评估系统提供了依据，以应对AI辅助编程时代的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI powered coding assistants like ChatGPT and other
coding copilots is transforming programming education, raising questions about
assessment practices, academic integrity, and skill development. As educators
seek alternatives to traditional grading methods susceptible to AI enabled
plagiarism, structured peer assessment could be a promising strategy. This
paper presents an empirical study of a rubric based, anonymized peer review
process implemented in a large introductory programming course.
  Students evaluated each other's final projects (2D game), and their
assessments were compared to instructor grades using correlation, mean absolute
error, and root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, reflective surveys from
47 teams captured student perceptions of fairness, grading behavior, and
preferences regarding grade aggregation. Results show that peer review can
approximate instructor evaluation with moderate accuracy and foster student
engagement, evaluative thinking, and interest in providing good feedback to
their peers. We discuss these findings for designing scalable, trustworthy peer
assessment systems to face the age of AI assisted coding.

Conclusion: 论文主张开发工具以跟踪许可证的采用和遵守情况，以确保其实现负责任使用AI的目标。

Abstract: Foundation models have had a transformative impact on AI. A combination of
large investments in research and development, growing sources of digital data
for training, and architectures that scale with data and compute has led to
models with powerful capabilities. Releasing assets is fundamental to
scientific advancement and commercial enterprise. However, concerns over
negligent or malicious uses of AI have led to the design of mechanisms to limit
the risks of the technology. The result has been a proliferation of licenses
with behavioral-use clauses and acceptable-use-policies that are increasingly
being adopted by commonly used families of models (Llama, Gemma, Deepseek) and
a myriad of smaller projects. We created and deployed a custom AI licenses
generator to facilitate license creation and have quantitatively and
qualitatively analyzed over 300 customized licenses created with this tool.
Alongside this we analyzed 1.7 million models licenses on the HuggingFace model
hub. Our results show increasing adoption of these licenses, interest in tools
that support their creation and a convergence on common clause configurations.
In this paper we take the position that tools for tracking adoption of, and
adherence to, these licenses is the natural next step and urgently needed in
order to ensure they have the desired impact of ensuring responsible use.

TL;DR: ConLES是一种滑动窗口一致性检查方法，用于处理长事件序列，通过分区和迭代对齐显著减少搜索空间，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长事件序列和大数据日志在数据丰富的世界中越来越常见，传统一致性检查方法因计算复杂性难以应对。

Method: ConLES将长序列划分为可管理的子序列，迭代对齐每个子序列，并利用全局信息优化对齐决策。

Result: ConLES在多个数据集上表现优于现有最优和启发式算法，显著减少搜索空间并高效扩展。

Conclusion: ConLES是一种高效且可扩展的长事件序列一致性检查方法，支持预定义和发现的流程模型。

Abstract: Long event sequences (termed traces) and large data logs that originate from
sensors and prediction models are becoming increasingly common in our data-rich
world. In such scenarios, conformance checking-validating a data log against an
expected system behavior (the process model) can become computationally
infeasible due to the exponential complexity of finding an optimal alignment.
To alleviate scalability challenges for this task, we propose ConLES, a
sliding-window conformance checking approach for long event sequences that
preserves the interpretability of alignment-based methods. ConLES partitions
traces into manageable subtraces and iteratively aligns each against the
expected behavior, leading to significant reduction of the search space while
maintaining overall accuracy. We use global information that captures
structural properties of both the trace and the process model, enabling
informed alignment decisions and discarding unpromising alignments, even if
they appear locally optimal. Performance evaluations across multiple datasets
highlight that ConLES outperforms the leading optimal and heuristic algorithms
for long traces, consistently achieving the optimal or near-optimal solution.
Unlike other conformance methods that struggle with long event sequences,
ConLES significantly reduces the search space, scales efficiently, and uniquely
supports both predefined and discovered process models, making it a viable and
leading option for conformance checking of long event sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in natural
language understanding (NLU), opening doors for innovative applications. We
introduce StreamLink - an LLM-driven distributed data system designed to
improve the efficiency and accessibility of data engineering tasks. We build
StreamLink on top of distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop to
handle large data at scale. One of the important design philosophies of
StreamLink is to respect user data privacy by utilizing local fine-tuned LLMs
instead of a public AI service like ChatGPT. With help from domain-adapted
LLMs, we can improve our system's understanding of natural language queries
from users in various scenarios and simplify the procedure of generating
database queries like the Structured Query Language (SQL) for information
processing. We also incorporate LLM-based syntax and security checkers to
guarantee the reliability and safety of each generated query. StreamLink
illustrates the potential of merging generative LLMs with distributed data
processing for comprehensive and user-centric data engineering. With this
architecture, we allow users to interact with complex database systems at
different scales in a user-friendly and security-ensured manner, where the SQL
generation reaches over 10\% of execution accuracy compared to baseline
methods, and allow users to find the most concerned item from hundreds of
millions of items within a few seconds using natural language.

Abstract: Scientific research heavily depends on suitable datasets for method
validation, but existing academic platforms with dataset management like
PapersWithCode suffer from inefficiencies in their manual workflow. To overcome
this bottleneck, we present a system, called ChatPD, that utilizes Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate dataset information extraction from academic
papers and construct a structured paper-dataset network. Our system consists of
three key modules: \textit{paper collection}, \textit{dataset information
extraction}, and \textit{dataset entity resolution} to construct paper-dataset
networks. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Graph Completion and Inference}
strategy to map dataset descriptions to their corresponding entities. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ChatPD not only outperforms the
existing platform PapersWithCode in dataset usage extraction but also achieves
about 90\% precision and recall in entity resolution tasks. Moreover, we have
deployed ChatPD to continuously extract which datasets are used in papers, and
provide a dataset discovery service, such as task-specific dataset queries and
similar dataset recommendations. We open source ChatPD and the current
paper-dataset network on this [GitHub

Abstract: In the era of AI, neural networks have become increasingly popular for
modeling, inference, and prediction, largely due to their potential for
universal approximation. With the proliferation of such deep learning models, a
question arises: are leaner statistical methods still relevant? To shed insight
on this question, we employ the mechanistic nonlinear ordinary differential
equation (ODE) inverse problem as a testbed, using physics-informed neural
network (PINN) as a representative of the deep learning paradigm and
manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) as a representative of
statistically principled methods. Through case studies involving the SEIR model
from epidemiology and the Lorenz model from chaotic dynamics, we demonstrate
that statistical methods are far from obsolete, especially when working with
sparse and noisy observations. On tasks such as parameter inference and
trajectory reconstruction, statistically principled methods consistently
achieve lower bias and variance, while using far fewer parameters and requiring
less hyperparameter tuning. Statistical methods can also decisively outperform
deep learning models on out-of-sample future prediction, where the absence of
relevant data often leads overparameterized models astray. Additionally, we
find that statistically principled approaches are more robust to accumulation
of numerical imprecision and can represent the underlying system more faithful
to the true governing ODEs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models require specialized hardware and
substantial energy to operate. As a consequence, cloud-based services that
provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these
services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the
number of tokens the model uses to generate it -- they pay a fixed price per
token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial
incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a
model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether
a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful
provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the
model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless,
as a proof-of-concept, we introduce an efficient heuristic algorithm that
allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion,
highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing
mechanism. Further, to completely eliminate the financial incentive to
strategize, we introduce a simple incentive-compatible token pricing mechanism.
Under this mechanism, the price users pay for an output provided by a model
depends on the number of characters of the output -- they pay a fixed price per
character. Along the way, to illustrate and complement our theoretical results,
we conduct experiments with several large language models from the
$\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input
prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线公平分配中，无限制条件下的强不可能性结果促使研究者转向受限估值函数实例，如个性化2值实例，以探索可行的公平分配方案。

Method: 提出确定性算法，通过维护优先级系统实现1/(2n-1)-MMS分配；同时设计基于匹配的算法，利用未来信息实现EF1和EF2分配。

Result: 算法在每一步维持1/(2n-1)-MMS分配，最终达到1/4-MMS分配；利用未来信息可实现每n步EF1分配和持续EF2分配。

Conclusion: 受限估值函数实例下，通过算法设计和未来信息利用，可实现非平凡的公平分配保证，扩展了在线公平分配的研究范围。

Abstract: We study an online fair division setting, where goods arrive one at a time
and there is a fixed set of $n$ agents, each of whom has an additive valuation
function over the goods. Once a good appears, the value each agent has for it
is revealed and it must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to one of the
agents. It is known that without any assumptions about the values being
severely restricted or coming from a distribution, very strong impossibility
results hold in this setting. To bypass the latter, we turn our attention to
instances where the valuation functions are restricted. In particular, we study
personalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each
agent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how
to obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions,
such as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s). We
suggest a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $1/(2n-1)$-MMS allocation at
every time step and show that this is the best possible any deterministic
algorithm can achieve if one cares about every single time step; nevertheless,
eventually the allocation constructed by our algorithm becomes a $1/4$-MMS
allocation. To achieve this, the algorithm implicitly maintains a fragile
system of priority levels for all agents. Further, we show that, by allowing
some limited access to future information, it is possible to have stronger
results with less involved approaches. By knowing the values of goods for $n-1$
time steps into the future, we design a matching-based algorithm that achieves
an EF$1$ allocation every $n$ time steps, while always maintaining an EF$2$
allocation. Finally, we show that our results allow us to get the first
nontrivial guarantees for additive instances in which the ratio of the maximum
over the minimum value an agent has for a good is bounded.

Result: 建立了丰富的比例概念层次，证明EJR+和FJR在满足EJR的同时仍适用于所有时间选举。

Conclusion: 论文丰富了时间投票中的比例代表制理论，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We study proportional representation in the framework of temporal voting with
approval ballots. Prior work adapted basic proportional representation concepts
-- justified representation (JR), proportional JR (PJR), and extended JR (EJR)
-- from the multiwinner setting to the temporal setting. Our work introduces
and examines ways of going beyond EJR. Specifically, we consider stronger
variants of JR, PJR, and EJR, and introduce temporal adaptations of more
demanding multiwinner axioms, such as EJR+, full JR (FJR), full proportional JR
(FPJR), and the Core. For each of these concepts, we investigate its existence
and study its relationship to existing notions, thereby establishing a rich
hierarchy of proportionality concepts. Notably, we show that two of our
proposed axioms -- EJR+ and FJR -- strengthen EJR while remaining satisfiable
in every temporal election.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合CPINN与ABPI的新方法，显著提升了功耗估计的准确性，同时保持实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代MPSoC需要精确的功耗估计，ABPI方法虽理论上有优势，但实际硬件实现效果未经验证。

Method: 提出CPINN-ABPI方法，结合物理模型与数据驱动学习，并通过多目标遗传算法优化。

Result: CPINN-ABPI显著降低了MAE和WMAPE，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: CPINN-ABPI在真实硬件中表现优异，解决了ABPI的精度问题。

Abstract: Efficient thermal and power management in modern multiprocessor
systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) demands accurate power consumption estimation. One of
the state-of-the-art approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI),
theoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures,
addressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI
performance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this
study, we conduct the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware
using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while
ABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state
temperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that
integrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying
thermal model of ABPI. Our approach employs a specialized loss function that
harmonizes physical principles with data-driven learning, complemented by
multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization to balance estimation accuracy
and computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a
reduction of 84.7\% CPU and 73.9\% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE)
relative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE)
improving from 47\%--81\% to $\sim$12\%. The method maintains real-time
performance with 195.3~$\mu$s of inference time, with similar 85\%--99\%
accuracy gains across heterogeneous SoCs.

Method: 利用感知相似性作为同义标准构建理想同义集（Synset），并通过最小化部分语义KL散度来近似其后验。

Result: 理论证明感知图像压缩的优化方向遵循三重权衡，实验验证了SIC编解码器的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的SVI分析方法和SIC方案在率失真感知性能上表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent contributions of semantic information theory reveal the set-element
relationship between semantic and syntactic information, represented as
synonymous relationships. In this paper, we propose a synonymous variational
inference (SVI) method based on this synonymity viewpoint to re-analyze the
perceptual image compression problem. It takes perceptual similarity as a
typical synonymous criterion to build an ideal synonymous set (Synset), and
approximate the posterior of its latent synonymous representation with a
parametric density by minimizing a partial semantic KL divergence. This
analysis theoretically proves that the optimization direction of perception
image compression follows a triple tradeoff that can cover the existing
rate-distortion-perception schemes. Additionally, we introduce synonymous image
compression (SIC), a new image compression scheme that corresponds to the
analytical process of SVI, and implement a progressive SIC codec to fully
leverage the model's capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate comparable
rate-distortion-perception performance using a single progressive SIC codec,
thus verifying the effectiveness of our proposed analysis method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多智能体系统（MAS）的自动化框架，用于提升Kubernetes集群在对抗性条件下的操作弹性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水平Pod自动扩展（HPA）方法难以应对动态和对抗性场景，而强化学习方法通常只优化单一目标。

Method: 通过四阶段框架设计HPA MAS：1）构建数字孪生模型；2）在模拟中训练针对故障场景的智能体；3）分析智能体行为；4）将策略迁移到实际集群。

Result: 实验表明，生成的HPA MAS在复杂集群中优于三种最先进的HPA系统。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解目标为子任务并协作解决，显著提升了集群的操作弹性。

Abstract: In cloud-native systems, Kubernetes clusters with interdependent services
often face challenges to their operational resilience due to poor workload
management issues such as resource blocking, bottlenecks, or continuous pod
crashes. These vulnerabilities are further amplified in adversarial scenarios,
such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDoS). Conventional Horizontal
Pod Autoscaling (HPA) approaches struggle to address such dynamic conditions,
while reinforcement learning-based methods, though more adaptable, typically
optimize single goals like latency or resource usage, neglecting broader
failure scenarios. We propose decomposing the overarching goal of maintaining
operational resilience into failure-specific sub-goals delegated to
collaborative agents, collectively forming an HPA Multi-Agent System (MAS). We
introduce an automated, four-phase online framework for HPA MAS design: 1)
modeling a digital twin built from cluster traces; 2) training agents in
simulation using roles and missions tailored to failure contexts; 3) analyzing
agent behaviors for explainability; and 4) transferring learned policies to the
real cluster. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated HPA MASs
outperform three state-of-the-art HPA systems in sustaining operational
resilience under various adversarial conditions in a proposed complex cluster.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单个LLM的行为已被广泛研究，但多智能体系统中同伴影响的动态机制尚不明确，因此需要探索从众行为及其调控方式。

Method: 通过一系列控制实验，分析了自我信心与同伴信心差距、信息呈现格式对从众行为的影响，并尝试调控从众程度。

Result: 实验表明，信心差距和信息格式显著影响从众行为，且适度调控从众倾向可提升协作效果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM多智能体系统的社会动态，为设计更有效的协作框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the
emergence of multi-agent systems where LLMs interact, collaborate, and make
decisions in shared environments. While individual model behavior has been
extensively studied, the dynamics of peer influence in such systems remain
underexplored. In this paper, we investigate herd behavior, the tendency of
agents to align their outputs with those of their peers, within LLM-based
multi-agent interactions. We present a series of controlled experiments that
reveal how herd behaviors are shaped by multiple factors. First, we show that
the gap between self-confidence and perceived confidence in peers significantly
impacts an agent's likelihood to conform. Second, we find that the format in
which peer information is presented plays a critical role in modulating the
strength of herd behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of herd
behavior can be systematically controlled, and that appropriately calibrated
herd tendencies can enhance collaborative outcomes. These findings offer new
insights into the social dynamics of LLM-based systems and open pathways for
designing more effective and adaptive multi-agent collaboration frameworks.

Motivation: 在多智能体强化学习中，部分可观测性下通信对性能至关重要，但传统方法假设合作且消息直接关联动作，限制了应用范围。

Method: 提出MARL-CPC框架，基于集体预测编码（CPC）设计消息学习模型，支持非合作、奖励无关的通信，并开发Bandit-CPC和IPPO-CPC算法。

Result: 实验表明，Bandit-CPC和IPPO-CPC在非合作任务中优于传统消息即动作方法，即使消息对发送者无直接收益也能实现有效通信。

Conclusion: MARL-CPC为复杂去中心化环境中的协调提供了新思路，突显了其在非合作场景下的潜力。

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective communication
improves agent performance, particularly under partial observability. We
propose MARL-CPC, a framework that enables communication among fully
decentralized, independent agents without parameter sharing. MARL-CPC
incorporates a message learning model based on collective predictive coding
(CPC) from emergent communication research. Unlike conventional methods that
treat messages as part of the action space and assume cooperation, MARL-CPC
links messages to state inference, supporting communication in non-cooperative,
reward-independent settings. We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and
IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks. Benchmarks show that
both outperform standard message-as-action approaches, establishing effective
communication even when messages offer no direct benefit to the sender. These
results highlight MARL-CPC's potential for enabling coordination in complex,
decentralized environments.

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可扩展的情感建模框架，标志着情感分析从回顾性分类向基于心理学的动态模拟转变。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis relies on surface-level linguistic patterns
and retrospective data, limiting its ability to capture the psychological and
contextual drivers of human sentiment. These limitations constrain its
effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy
testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust
framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with
psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally
representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic
information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs,
and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent
embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to
real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment
ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted
Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human
responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating
original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached
81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile
encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d =
0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials
(+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676,
Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment
modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents. This work signals a
paradigm shift in sentiment analysis from retrospective classification to
prospective and dynamic simulation grounded in psychology of sentiment
formation.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative
intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally
organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position
paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward
this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks.
Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents,
communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its
coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a
systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and
topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in
areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and
generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in
complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges
and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our
perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic
AI.

Conclusion: CSI-Bench为健康和以人为中心的应用提供了可扩展、隐私保护的WiFi感知系统基础。

Abstract: WiFi sensing has emerged as a compelling contactless modality for human
activity monitoring by capturing fine-grained variations in Channel State
Information (CSI). Its ability to operate continuously and non-intrusively
while preserving user privacy makes it particularly suitable for health
monitoring. However, existing WiFi sensing systems struggle to generalize in
real-world settings, largely due to datasets collected in controlled
environments with homogeneous hardware and fragmented, session-based recordings
that fail to reflect continuous daily activity.
  We present CSI-Bench, a large-scale, in-the-wild benchmark dataset collected
using commercial WiFi edge devices across 26 diverse indoor environments with
35 real users. Spanning over 461 hours of effective data, CSI-Bench captures
realistic signal variability under natural conditions. It includes
task-specific datasets for fall detection, breathing monitoring, localization,
and motion source recognition, as well as a co-labeled multitask dataset with
joint annotations for user identity, activity, and proximity. To support the
development of robust and generalizable models, CSI-Bench provides standardized
evaluation splits and baseline results for both single-task and multi-task
learning. CSI-Bench offers a foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving WiFi
sensing systems in health and broader human-centric applications.

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) represents an emerging economic paradigm that
redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial
intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance
the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several
challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage
demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between
lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of
traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To
address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture
tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application
scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual
co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented
execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the
proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we
outline open challenges to inspire future research.

Motivation: 传统低阶有限元方法在近不可压缩材料的线性弹性方程中因Lamé系数λ趋近于无穷大（或泊松比ν趋近于1/2）时出现锁定问题，导致精度下降。

Method: 利用PINNs对给定方程进行适当分解，以缓解系数极端不平衡的问题，同时求解正向和逆向问题，恢复分解系统的解及相关外部条件。

Result: 通过包括常数、变量和参数化Lamé系数的数值实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为近不可压缩材料的线性弹性方程提供了一种鲁棒的数值解法，避免了传统方法的锁定问题。

Abstract: Due to divergence instability, the accuracy of low-order conforming finite
element methods for nearly incompressible homogeneous elasticity equations
deteriorates as the Lam\'e coefficient $\lambda\to\infty$, or equivalently as
the Poisson ratio $\nu\to1/2$. This phenomenon, known as locking or
non-robustness, remains not fully understood despite extensive investigation.
In this paper, we propose a robust method based on a fundamentally different,
machine-learning-driven approach. Leveraging recently developed
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we address the numerical solution of
linear elasticity equations governing nearly incompressible materials. The core
idea of our method is to appropriately decompose the given equations to
alleviate the extreme imbalance in the coefficients, while simultaneously
solving both the forward and inverse problems to recover the solutions of the
decomposed systems as well as the associated external conditions. Through
various numerical experiments, including constant, variable and parametric
Lam\'e coefficients, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: 该KSD型检验方法为IRG模型提供了一种高效、通用的拟合优度检验工具。

Abstract: Complex data are often represented as a graph, which in turn can often be
viewed as a realisation of a random graph, such as of an inhomogeneous random
graph model (IRG). For general fast goodness-of-fit tests in high dimensions,
kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD) tests are a powerful tool. Here, we develop,
test, and analyse a KSD-type goodness-of-fit test for IRG models that can be
carried out with a single observation of the network. The test is applicable to
a network of any size and does not depend on the asymptotic distribution of the
test statistic. We also provide theoretical guarantees.

Motivation: 时空深度学习模型通常假设响应具有独立协方差矩阵，无法捕捉底层相关性；而传统高斯过程存在可扩展性和协方差核函数假设限制的问题。

Method: 提出STACI框架，结合变分贝叶斯神经网络近似非平稳时空高斯过程，并开发新型时空共形推理算法。

Result: STACI在准确近似时空过程方面优于其他方法，并能轻松处理百万级观测数据。

Conclusion: STACI是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于时空不确定性量化。

Abstract: Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty
quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep
learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent
covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying
correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of
scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive
assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel
framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of
non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal
inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training
capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid
prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms
competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal
processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of
observations.

TL;DR: 论文证明了在均值场位置-尺度变分族下，使用重参数化梯度的黑盒变分推断（BBVI）能以几乎与维度无关的速率收敛。对于强对数凹和对数光滑的目标，BBVI的迭代次数为O(log d)，优于全秩位置-尺度族的O(d)依赖性。对于重尾族，维度依赖性较弱，为O(d^{2/k})。若目标对数密度的Hessian为常数，复杂度则无显式维度依赖性。

Motivation: 研究黑盒变分推断在均值场位置-尺度变分族下的收敛速率，探索其维度依赖性的改进空间。

Method: 使用重参数化梯度的黑盒变分推断（BBVI），分析其在均值场位置-尺度变分族下的收敛行为。

Result: 对于强对数凹和对数光滑目标，BBVI的迭代次数为O(log d)；对于重尾族，维度依赖性为O(d^{2/k})；若Hessian为常数，复杂度无显式维度依赖性。

Conclusion: BBVI在均值场位置-尺度变分族下能实现高效的收敛速率，且在某些条件下维度依赖性显著降低。

Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family,
black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient
converges at an almost dimension-independent rate. Specifically, for strongly
log-concave and log-smooth targets, the number of iterations for BBVI with a
sub-Gaussian family to achieve an objective $\epsilon$-close to the global
optimum is $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$, which improves over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$
dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we
provide a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dimension dependence, where $k$ is the
number of finite moments. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target
log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension
dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key
to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of
the target log-density.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many
different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions
should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably
yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the
sparsest interpolating ReLU network -- i.e., the network with the fewest
nonzero parameters or neurons -- a goal with wide-ranging implications for
efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression.
Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere
differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to
correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data.
This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of
sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the
use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing
$\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 < p < 1$, a classical
sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying
these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is
infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex
objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond
exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding
when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to
recover sparse networks through training.

Conclusion: 该框架为平均SA算法的高概率性能分析提供了通用工具，并在多个应用中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Polyak-Ruppert averaging is a widely used technique to achieve the optimal
asymptotic variance of stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms, yet its
high-probability performance guarantees remain underexplored in general
settings. In this paper, we present a general framework for establishing
non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the error of averaged SA iterates. Our
approach assumes access to individual concentration bounds for the unaveraged
iterates and yields a sharp bound on the averaged iterates. We also construct
an example, showing the tightness of our result up to constant multiplicative
factors. As direct applications, we derive tight concentration bounds for
contractive SA algorithms and for algorithms such as temporal difference
learning and Q-learning with averaging, obtaining new bounds in settings where
traditional analysis is challenging.

Conclusion: DCH模型能有效建模时间网络的社区结构和依赖关系，谱聚类和GMM方法在实际应用中具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped
relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings
including online social media communications, financial transactions, and
international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure
and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled
through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a
receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node
pairs.
  We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent
community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with
mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and
dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper
bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count
matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and
the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on
bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count
vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We
also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation
along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of
Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing
network size and time duration.

Conclusion: QTD不仅提升了推理效率，还通过统一离散和连续扩散范式，推动了扩散生成模型的理论基础。

Abstract: Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in data
generation across various domains, yet their efficiency remains constrained by
two critical limitations: (1) the local adjacency structure of the forward
Markov process, which restricts long-range transitions in the data space, and
(2) inherent biases introduced during the simulation of time-inhomogeneous
reverse denoising processes. To address these challenges, we propose Quantized
Transition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization
with discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous
data distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation
and binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete
latent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming
distance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports
long-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we
introduce a \textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse
CTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal
score assumptions. Through a novel KL dynamic analysis of the reverse CTMC, we
prove that QTD can generate samples with $O(d\ln^2(d/\epsilon))$ score
evaluations in expectation to approximate the $d$--dimensional target
distribution $p_*$ within an $\epsilon$ error tolerance. Our method not only
establishes state-of-the-art inference efficiency but also advances the
theoretical foundations of diffusion-based generative modeling by unifying
discrete and continuous diffusion paradigms.

Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates
from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group
synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a
way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information
about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we
introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on
a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the
hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group
synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image
processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of
higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations.
Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions
which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group
synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general
higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on
higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss
theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under
outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through
numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our
higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization
outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to
outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM
reconstruction package.

Abstract: This paper considers a canonical problem in kernel regression: how good are
the model performances when it is trained by the popular online first-order
algorithms, compared to the offline ones, such as ridge and ridgeless
regression? In this paper, we analyze the foundational single-pass Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) in kernel regression under source condition where the
optimal predictor can even not belong to the RKHS, i.e. the model is
misspecified. Specifically, we focus on the inner product kernel over the
sphere and characterize the exact orders of the excess risk curves under
different scales of sample sizes $n$ concerning the input dimension $d$.
Surprisingly, we show that SGD achieves min-max optimal rates up to constants
among all the scales, without suffering the saturation, a prevalent phenomenon
observed in (ridge) regression, except when the model is highly misspecified
and the learning is in a final stage where $n\gg d^{\gamma}$ with any constant
$\gamma >0$. The main reason for SGD to overcome the curse of saturation is the
exponentially decaying step size schedule, a common practice in deep neural
network training. As a byproduct, we provide the \emph{first} provable
advantage of the scheme over the iterative averaging method in the common
setting.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations for black-box models aim to pr ovide insight into
an algorithmic decision to its recipient. For a binary classification problem
an individual counterfactual details which features might be changed for the
model to infer the opposite class. High-dimensional feature spaces that are
typical of machine learning classification models admit many possible
counterfactual examples to a decision, and so it is important to identify
additional criteria to select the most useful counterfactuals. In this paper,
we explore the idea that the counterfactuals should be maximally informative
when considering the knowledge of a specific individual about the underlying
classifier. To quantify this information gain we explicitly model the knowledge
of the individual, and assess the uncertainty of predictions which the
individual makes by the width of a conformal prediction interval. Regions of
feature space where the prediction interval is wide correspond to areas where
the confidence in decision making is low, and an additional counterfactual
example might be more informative to an individual. To explore and evaluate our
individualised conformal prediction interval counterfactuals (CPICFs), first we
present a synthetic data set on a hypercube which allows us to fully visualise
the decision boundary, conformal intervals via three different methods, and
resultant CPICFs. Second, in this synthetic data set we explore the impact of a
single CPICF on the knowledge of an individual locally around the original
query. Finally, in both our synthetic data set and a complex real world dataset
with a combination of continuous and discrete variables, we measure the utility
of these counterfactuals via data augmentation, testing the performance on a
held out set.

Conclusion: 基于相对似然的概率分布集合预测方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，为不确定性建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Predictions in the form of sets of probability distributions, so-called
credal sets, provide a suitable means to represent a learner's epistemic
uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to
credal prediction based on the statistical notion of relative likelihood: The
target of prediction is the set of all (conditional) probability distributions
produced by the collection of plausible models, namely those models whose
relative likelihood exceeds a specified threshold. This threshold has an
intuitive interpretation and allows for controlling the trade-off between
correctness and precision of credal predictions. We tackle the problem of
approximating credal sets defined in this way by means of suitably modified
ensemble learning techniques. To validate our approach, we illustrate its
effectiveness by experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating superior
uncertainty representation without compromising predictive performance. We also
compare our method against several state-of-the-art baselines in credal
prediction.

Abstract: We present a novel method for efficiently computing optimal transport maps
and Wasserstein barycenters in high-dimensional spaces. Our approach uses
conditional normalizing flows to approximate the input distributions as
invertible pushforward transformations from a common latent space. This makes
it possible to directly solve the primal problem using gradient-based
minimization of the transport cost, unlike previous methods that rely on dual
formulations and complex adversarial optimization. We show how this approach
can be extended to compute Wasserstein barycenters by solving a conditional
variance minimization problem. A key advantage of our conditional architecture
is that it enables the computation of barycenters for hundreds of input
distributions, which was computationally infeasible with previous methods. Our
numerical experiments illustrate that our approach yields accurate results
across various high-dimensional tasks and compares favorably with previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for semantic hypothesis testing tailored to
imaging inverse problems. Modern imaging methods struggle to support hypothesis
testing, a core component of the scientific method that is essential for the
rigorous interpretation of experiments and robust interfacing with
decision-making processes. There are three main reasons why image-based
hypothesis testing is challenging. First, the difficulty of using a single
observation to simultaneously reconstruct an image, formulate hypotheses, and
quantify their statistical significance. Second, the hypotheses encountered in
imaging are mostly of semantic nature, rather than quantitative statements
about pixel values. Third, it is challenging to control test error
probabilities because the null and alternative distributions are often unknown.
Our proposed approach addresses these difficulties by leveraging concepts from
self-supervised computational imaging, vision-language models, and
non-parametric hypothesis testing with e-values. We demonstrate our proposed
framework through numerical experiments related to image-based phenotyping,
where we achieve excellent power while robustly controlling Type I errors.

Motivation: 传统参数估计方法（如MoM、MLE和MPL）在处理A1和A2家族的复杂依赖结构时存在困难，尤其是在非单调关系和数值不稳定性方面。因此，需要一种更稳健和准确的方法。

Method: IGNIS Network是一种统一的神经框架，通过模拟数据训练，学习从依赖度量（如Kendall's tau）到copula参数的直接映射。该方法适用于五种Archimedean copula家族，并通过理论引导的后处理确保参数约束。

Conclusion: IGNIS Network展示了神经方法在现代依赖建模中的潜力，为复杂依赖结构提供了更稳健和准确的参数估计。

Abstract: Parameter estimation for Archimedean copulas remains a challenging problem,
particularly for the recently developed A1 and A2 families that exhibit complex
dependency structures. Traditional methods, such as the Method of Moments
(MoM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood
(MPL), often struggle due to issues of non-monotonic relationship with
dependency measures such as Kendall's tau (as in the case of A1) and numerical
instability. In this paper, we present the IGNIS Network, a novel, unified
neural framework that learns a direct mapping from observable dependency
measures to copula parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of classical
approaches. Our approach is trained on simulated data spanning five Archimedean
copula families including Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, A1, and A2, ensuring its
general applicability across the entire family. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate that the IGNIS Network reduces estimation errors compared to MoM,
while inherently enforcing parameter constraints through theory-guided
post-processing. We further validate the practical utility of our method on
diverse real-world datasets, including financial returns (AAPL-MSFT),
healthcare metrics (CDC Diabetes indicators), and environmental measurements
(PM2.5 air quality). Our results underscore the transformative potential of
neural methods for robust and accurate dependence modeling in modern
applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Symplectic Generative Network (SGN), a deep generative model
that leverages Hamiltonian mechanics to construct an invertible,
volume-preserving mapping between a latent space and the data space. By
endowing the latent space with a symplectic structure and modeling data
generation as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian system, SGN achieves exact

determinant calculations. In this work, we provide a rigorous mathematical
foundation for SGNs through a comprehensive theoretical framework that
includes: (i) complete proofs of invertibility and volume preservation, (ii) a
formal complexity analysis with theoretical comparisons to Variational
Autoencoders and Normalizing Flows, (iii) strengthened universal approximation
results with quantitative error bounds, (iv) an information-theoretic analysis
based on the geometry of statistical manifolds, and (v) an extensive stability
analysis with adaptive integration guarantees. These contributions highlight
the fundamental advantages of SGNs and establish a solid foundation for future
empirical investigations and applications to complex, high-dimensional data.

Motivation: 传统特征选择方法（如互信息和遗传算法）可能忽略极端依赖关系，而这些关系对高风险人群的糖尿病预测至关重要。

Method: 使用A2 copula的上尾依赖系数（λU）量化预测变量与糖尿病诊断之间的极端依赖关系，并应用于CDC数据集。

Result: 该方法选出的五个特征在四种分类器上表现优异，准确率高达86.5%，AUC达0.806，与21个特征的完整模型相当。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将copula的上尾依赖应用于监督特征选择，为糖尿病预防提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate diabetes risk prediction relies on identifying key features from
complex health datasets, but conventional methods like mutual information (MI)
filters and genetic algorithms (GAs) often overlook extreme dependencies
critical for high-risk subpopulations. In this study we introduce a
feature-selection framework using the upper-tail dependence coefficient
({\lambda}U) of the novel A2 copula, which quantifies how often extreme higher
values of a predictor co-occur with diabetes diagnoses (target variable).
Applied to the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (n=253,680), our method
prioritizes five predictors (self-reported general health, high blood pressure,
body mass index, mobility limitations, and high cholesterol levels) based on
upper tail dependencies. These features match or outperform MI and GA selected
subsets across four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression,
Gradient Boosting), achieving accuracy up to 86.5% (XGBoost) and AUC up to
0.806 (Gradient Boosting), rivaling the full 21-feature model. Permutation
importance confirms clinical relevance, with BMI and general health driving
accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply a copula's
upper-tail dependence for supervised feature selection, bridging extreme-value
theory and machine learning to deliver a practical toolkit for diabetes
prevention.

Motivation: 现代基础模型表现出卓越的分布外（OOD）泛化能力，但其理论原理尚不明确。论文旨在通过研究扩散模型的组合泛化能力，揭示这一现象背后的理论机制。

Method: 通过分析扩散模型的组合泛化能力，提出基于简单性的理论框架，并研究正则化最大似然估计器在两种关键情况下的表现。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论框架揭示了简单性在OOD泛化中的关键作用，为理解基础模型的泛化能力提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Modern foundation models exhibit remarkable out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization, solving tasks far beyond the support of their training data.
However, the theoretical principles underpinning this phenomenon remain
elusive. This paper investigates this problem by examining the compositional
generalization abilities of diffusion models in image generation. Our analysis
reveals that while neural network architectures are expressive enough to
represent a wide range of models -- including many with undesirable behavior on
OOD inputs -- the true, generalizable model that aligns with human expectations
typically corresponds to the simplest among those consistent with the training
data.
  Motivated by this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for OOD
generalization via simplicity, quantified using a predefined simplicity metric.
We analyze two key regimes: (1) the constant-gap setting, where the true model
is strictly simpler than all spurious alternatives by a fixed gap, and (2) the
vanishing-gap setting, where the fixed gap is replaced by a smoothness
condition ensuring that models close in simplicity to the true model yield
similar predictions. For both regimes, we study the regularized maximum
likelihood estimator and establish the first sharp sample complexity guarantees
for learning the true, generalizable, simple model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的模型，用于在手术中推荐最佳静脉输液和血管加压药物剂量，以减少术中低血压和术后急性肾损伤（AKI）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术决策依赖医生经验，存在变异性。数据驱动的系统可优化术中决策，减少术后并发症。

Method: 使用深度Q网络（DQN）强化学习模型，基于16个变量（包括生理时间序列和药物剂量）训练和测试。

Result: 模型在69%的情况下与医生决策一致，推荐剂量与医生实际剂量相近，且AKI发生率最低。

Conclusion: 模型有望减少术后AKI并改善其他与术中低血压相关的结果。

Abstract: Traditional methods of surgical decision making heavily rely on human
experience and prompt actions, which are variable. A data-driven system
generating treatment recommendations based on patient states can be a
substantial asset in perioperative decision-making, as in cases of
intraoperative hypotension, for which suboptimal management is associated with
acute kidney injury (AKI), a common and morbid postoperative complication. We
developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to recommend optimum dose of
intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors during surgery to avoid intraoperative
hypotension and postoperative AKI. We retrospectively analyzed 50,021 surgeries
from 42,547 adult patients who underwent major surgery at a quaternary care
hospital between June 2014 and September 2020. Of these, 34,186 surgeries were
used for model training and 15,835 surgeries were reserved for testing. We
developed a Deep Q-Networks based RL model using 16 variables including
intraoperative physiologic time series, total dose of IV fluid and vasopressors
extracted for every 15-minute epoch. The model replicated 69% of physician's
decisions for the dosage of vasopressors and proposed higher or lower dosage of
vasopressors than received in 10% and 21% of the treatments, respectively. In
terms of IV fluids, the model's recommendations were within 0.05 ml/kg/15 min
of the actual dose in 41% of the cases, with higher or lower doses recommended
for 27% and 32% of the treatments, respectively. The model resulted in a higher
estimated policy value compared to the physicians' actual treatments, as well
as random and zero-drug policies. AKI prevalence was the lowest in patients
receiving medication dosages that aligned with model's decisions. Our findings
suggest that implementation of the model's policy has the potential to reduce
postoperative AKI and improve other outcomes driven by intraoperative
hypotension.

Motivation: 现有CDSR框架主要依赖自注意力变换器，但忽视了自注意力模块本身的学习能力。论文旨在通过优化自注意力机制，提升简单模型的CDSR性能。

Method: 引入帕累托最优自注意力，将跨域学习建模为多目标问题，动态最小化跨域注意力分数，实现知识自动迁移（AutoCDSR）。进一步提出性能更强的变体AutoCDSR+。

Result: AutoCDSR显著提升了SASRec和Bert4Rec的Recall@10（9.8%和16.0%）和NDCG@10（12.0%和16.7%）。

Conclusion: AutoCDSR是一种灵活、易部署的插件模块，无需复杂调参即可显著提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a popular paradigm in modern recommender
systems. In particular, one challenging problem in this space is cross-domain
sequential recommendation (CDSR), which aims to predict future behaviors given
user interactions across multiple domains. Existing CDSR frameworks are mostly
built on the self-attention transformer and seek to improve by explicitly
injecting additional domain-specific components (e.g. domain-aware module
blocks). While these additional components help, we argue they overlook the
core self-attention module already present in the transformer, a naturally
powerful tool to learn correlations among behaviors. In this work, we aim to
improve the CDSR performance for simple models from a novel perspective of
enhancing the self-attention. Specifically, we introduce a Pareto-optimal
self-attention and formulate the cross-domain learning as a multi-objective
problem, where we optimize the recommendation task while dynamically minimizing
the cross-domain attention scores. Our approach automates knowledge transfer in
CDSR (dubbed as AutoCDSR) -- it not only mitigates negative transfer but also
encourages complementary knowledge exchange among auxiliary domains. Based on
the idea, we further introduce AutoCDSR+, a more performant variant with slight
additional cost. Our proposal is easy to implement and works as a plug-and-play
module that can be incorporated into existing transformer-based recommenders.
Besides flexibility, it is practical to deploy because it brings little extra
computational overheads without heavy hyper-parameter tuning. AutoCDSR on
average improves Recall@10 for SASRec and Bert4Rec by 9.8% and 16.0% and
NDCG@10 by 12.0% and 16.7%, respectively. Code is available at
https://github.com/snap-research/AutoCDSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集检索方法难以捕捉细粒度科学概念，而基于LLM的方法缺乏语料库知识支持，导致结果不可靠。

Method: 提出SemRank框架，通过多粒度科学概念索引论文，利用LLM识别查询核心概念以实现精准语义匹配。

Result: 实验表明SemRank显著提升检索性能，优于现有LLM基线且高效。

Conclusion: SemRank有效解决了科学论文检索中的细粒度概念捕捉问题，兼具准确性和效率。

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval is essential for supporting literature discovery
and research. While dense retrieval methods demonstrate effectiveness in
general-purpose tasks, they often fail to capture fine-grained scientific
concepts that are essential for accurate understanding of scientific queries.
Recent studies also use large language models (LLMs) for query understanding;
however, these methods often lack grounding in corpus-specific knowledge and
may generate unreliable or unfaithful content. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SemRank, an effective and efficient paper retrieval framework that
combines LLM-guided query understanding with a concept-based semantic index.
Each paper is indexed using multi-granular scientific concepts, including
general research topics and detailed key phrases. At query time, an LLM
identifies core concepts derived from the corpus to explicitly capture the
query's information need. These identified concepts enable precise semantic
matching, significantly enhancing retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that
SemRank consistently improves the performance of various base retrievers,
surpasses strong existing LLM-based baselines, and remains highly efficient.

Conclusion: Yambda-5B的发布旨在推动推荐系统研究、创新和可重复性。

Abstract: We present Yambda-5B, a large-scale open dataset sourced from the
Yandex.Music streaming platform. Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item
interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset
includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening
events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In
addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a
convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key
distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag,
which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This
distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning
algorithms, as Yandex.Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track
selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an
evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation
algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We
report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced
models (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing
Yambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible,
industrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote
reproducible results in recommender systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UDuo的通用双重优化框架，用于动态环境下的在线资源分配问题，通过创新的用户到达表示、自适应分配策略和在线时间序列预测，显著提升了效率和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法基于静态用户到达模型，无法适应动态环境的变化，因此需要一种新的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: UDuo框架包括三个关键创新：(i) 时间用户到达表示向量，(ii) 自适应资源分配策略，(iii) 在线时间序列预测方法。

Result: 实验表明，UDuo在真实定价场景中比传统方法效率更高、收敛更快，同时保证了理论有效性。

Conclusion: UDuo为动态环境下的在线资源分配问题提供了一种高效且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Online resource allocation under budget constraints critically depends on
proper modeling of user arrival dynamics. Classical approaches employ
stochastic user arrival models to derive near-optimal solutions through
fractional matching formulations of exposed users for downstream allocation
tasks. However, this is no longer a reasonable assumption when the environment
changes dynamically. In this work, We propose the Universal Dual optimization
framework UDuo, a novel paradigm that fundamentally rethinks online allocation
through three key innovations: (i) a temporal user arrival representation
vector that explicitly captures distribution shifts in user arrival patterns
and resource consumption dynamics, (ii) a resource pacing learner with adaptive
allocation policies that generalize to heterogeneous constraint scenarios, and
(iii) an online time-series forecasting approach for future user arrival
distributions that achieves asymptotically optimal solutions with constraint
feasibility guarantees in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that
UDuo achieves higher efficiency and faster convergence than the traditional
stochastic arrival model in real-world pricing while maintaining rigorous
theoretical validity for general online allocation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基于图神经网络的推荐系统需要满足用户隐私和法规要求，能够选择性遗忘训练数据，但传统方法存在性能下降或假设不成立的问题。

Method: 提出Influence Encoder，直接根据遗忘请求和现有模型参数生成更新后的参数，减少微调需求。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，该方法表现出卓越的遗忘效果，且速度比重新训练方法快10倍以上。

Conclusion: UnlearnRec为推荐系统提供了一种高效且性能保持的数据遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at
modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios
requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove
specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory
frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of
certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge
presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs
creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting
recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from
significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and
diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that
may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random
architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic
pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning
operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with
existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned
model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving
model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks
demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness
while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We
release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.

Method: 提出两种协议：1）使用量子随机行走形式，结合量子与经典动力学；2）利用IBM量子硬件的固有噪声生成图像。

Result: 量子随机行走方法生成的MNIST图像FID更低；四量子位硬件实验验证了噪声作为资源的可行性。

Conclusion: 量子噪声可作为资源，为大规模量子生成AI算法开辟新方向。

Abstract: Quantum Diffusion Models (QDMs) are an emerging paradigm in Generative AI
that aims to use quantum properties to improve the performances of their
classical counterparts. However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable
due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous
work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In
the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a
specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process
produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with
lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics.
In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by
exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four
qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios
for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is
neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.

Motivation: 探索非欧几里得NQS在量子多体系统中的应用潜力，特别是在具有层次相互作用结构的系统中。

Method: 使用双曲GRU和欧几里得RNN/GRU构建NQS，在一维和二维横向场伊辛模型及一维海森堡模型中测试性能。

Result: 双曲GRU在所有实验中表现优于或与欧几里得RNN相当，在具有层次结构的系统中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 双曲GRU是可行的非欧几里得NQS变分方法，未来可探索其他非欧几里得NQS类型。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum
state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of
approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In
particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both
conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical
settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM)
of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$
systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments
performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or
better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these
settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of
hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum
many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a
clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &
$J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor
interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its
Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent
of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU
almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a
tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU
NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin
systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions.
Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of
non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的训练数据和MLP，可以准确分类HHL算法的适用性问题。

Abstract: Under the nearing error-corrected era of quantum computing, it is necessary
to understand the suitability of certain post-NISQ algorithms for practical
problems. One of the most promising, applicable and yet difficult to implement
in practical terms is the Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for linear
systems of equations. An enormous number of problems can be expressed as linear
systems of equations, from Machine Learning to fluid dynamics. However, in most
cases, HHL will not be able to provide a practical, reasonable solution to
these problems. This paper's goal inquires about whether problems can be
labeled using Machine Learning classifiers as suitable or unsuitable for HHL
implementation when some numerical information about the problem is known
beforehand. This work demonstrates that training on significantly
representative data distributions is critical to achieve good classifications
of the problems based on the numerical properties of the matrix representing
the system of equations. Accurate classification is possible through
Multi-Layer Perceptrons, although with careful design of the training data
distribution and classifier parameters.

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression is a well-known machine learning technique for
which several quantum algorithms have been proposed. We show here that in a
wide range of scenarios these algorithms show no exponential speedup. We
achieve this by rigorously proving that the condition number of a kernel matrix
scales at least linearly with the matrix size under general assumptions on the
data and kernel. We additionally prove that the sparsity and Frobenius norm of
a kernel matrix scale linearly under similar assumptions. The implications for
the quantum algorithms runtime are independent of the complexity of loading
classical data on a quantum computer and also apply to dequantised algorithms.
We supplement our theoretical analysis with numerical verification for popular
kernels in machine learning.

*Weiting Liu,Jiaxu Cui,Jiao Hu,En Wang,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.SC

TL;DR: 提出了一种预训练的符号基础回归器，用于压缩复杂数据并生成可解释的物理表示，显著提高了方程推断效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统科学定律发现过程复杂且耗时，机器学习技术可以简化这一过程并提供对现代科学基本问题的洞察。

Method: 引入预训练的符号基础回归器，测试了非网络符号回归、复杂网络符号回归及网络动力学推断。

Result: 方程推断效率提高了三倍，同时在流行病数据中发现了更直观的交互传播规律。

Conclusion: 该模型扩展了符号回归在复杂网络中的应用，为揭示复杂现象背后的机制提供了基础解决方案。

Abstract: In science, we are interested not only in forecasting but also in
understanding how predictions are made, specifically what the interpretable
underlying model looks like. Data-driven machine learning technology can
significantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual
process of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into
fundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained
symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with
numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical
representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic
regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of
network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry,
ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in
equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline
approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our
model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global
epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the
application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex
networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the
hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing
interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的ViTA方法，通过模拟神经科学中的星形胶质细胞，提升预训练深度神经网络的可解释性，使其更符合人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型虽然精度高，但决策过程缺乏可解释性，且随着模型复杂度增加，可解释性通常降低。现有方法（如XAI技术或训练中加入约束）适用性有限。

Method: 提出ViTA（Vision Transformer with artificial Astrocytes），一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟星形胶质细胞增强预训练网络的推理能力，生成更符合人类感知的解释。

Result: 使用Grad-CAM和Grad-CAM++等XAI技术评估ViTA，并与标准ViT对比。实验结果表明，ViTA显著提升了模型解释与人类感知的对齐度。

Conclusion: ViTA方法通过引入人工星形胶质细胞，显著提升了模型解释的可理解性，且无需额外训练，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Machine learning models achieve high precision, but their decision-making
processes often lack explainability. Furthermore, as model complexity
increases, explainability typically decreases. Existing efforts to improve
explainability primarily involve developing new eXplainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) techniques or incorporating explainability constraints
during training. While these approaches yield specific improvements, their
applicability remains limited. In this work, we propose the Vision Transformer
with artificial Astrocytes (ViTA). This training-free approach is inspired by
neuroscience and enhances the reasoning of a pretrained deep neural network to
generate more human-aligned explanations. We evaluated our approach employing
two well-known XAI techniques, Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, and compared it to a
standard Vision Transformer (ViT). Using the ClickMe dataset, we quantified the
similarity between the heatmaps produced by the XAI techniques and a
(human-aligned) ground truth. Our results consistently demonstrate that
incorporating artificial astrocytes enhances the alignment of model
explanations with human perception, leading to statistically significant
improvements across all XAI techniques and metrics utilized.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了DeepFake检测的局限性，提出多类别和归因模型的重要性，并通过实验验证了对比方法在跨数据集泛化中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DeepFake技术的普及，现有二元检测模型无法区分不同篡改方法，亟需更精细的归因模型以提升可信度和可解释性。

Method: 利用五种先进骨干模型，在六个DeepFake数据集上进行实验，比较二元与多类别模型的泛化能力，并评估对比方法的效果。

Result: 二元模型泛化能力更强，但更大模型、对比方法和高质量数据可提升归因模型的性能。

Conclusion: 归因模型在提升DeepFake检测的实用性和解释性方面具有潜力，未来需进一步优化模型和数据质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFake generation, along with the proliferation of
open-source tools, have significantly lowered the barrier for creating
synthetic media. This trend poses a serious threat to the integrity and
authenticity of online information, undermining public trust in institutions
and media. State-of-the-art research on DeepFake detection has primarily
focused on binary detection models. A key limitation of these models is that
they treat all manipulation techniques as equivalent, despite the fact that
different methods introduce distinct artifacts and visual cues. Only a limited
number of studies explore DeepFake attribution models, although such models are
crucial in practical settings. By providing the specific manipulation method
employed, these models could enhance both the perceived trustworthiness and
explainability for end users. In this work, we leverage five state-of-the-art
backbone models and conduct extensive experiments across six DeepFake datasets.
First, we compare binary and multi-class models in terms of cross-dataset
generalization. Second, we examine the accuracy of attribution models in
detecting seen manipulation methods in unknown datasets, hence uncovering data
distribution shifts on the same DeepFake manipulations. Last, we assess the
effectiveness of contrastive methods in improving cross-dataset generalization
performance. Our findings indicate that while binary models demonstrate better
generalization abilities, larger models, contrastive methods, and higher data
quality can lead to performance improvements in attribution models. The code of
this work is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN模型未考虑计算内存（CIM）架构限制，限制了其在边缘设备上的加速潜力。

Method: 提出CIM-NET架构和CIM-CONV算子，结合滑动处理和全连接变换，优化大感受野操作和MVM加速。

Result: CIM-NET将MVM操作减少至1/77，同时保持接近FastDVDnet的去噪性能（PSNR 35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB）。

Conclusion: 该框架为CIM芯片上的高效视频去噪提供了可行方案，平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: While deep neural network (DNN)-based video denoising has demonstrated
significant performance, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices
remains challenging due to stringent real-time and energy efficiency
requirements. Computing-in-Memory (CIM) chips offer a promising solution by
integrating computation within memory cells, enabling rapid matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM). However, existing DNN models are often designed without
considering CIM architectural constraints, thus limiting their acceleration
potential during inference. To address this, we propose a hardware-algorithm
co-design framework incorporating two innovations: (1) a CIM-Aware
Architecture, CIM-NET, optimized for large receptive field operation and CIM's
crossbar-based MVM acceleration; and (2) a pseudo-convolutional operator,
CIM-CONV, used within CIM-NET to integrate slide-based processing with fully
connected transformations for high-quality feature extraction and
reconstruction. This framework significantly reduces the number of MVM
operations, improving inference speed on CIM chips while maintaining
competitive performance. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the
conventional lightweight model FastDVDnet, CIM-NET substantially reduces MVM
operations with a slight decrease in denoising performance. With a stride value
of 8, CIM-NET reduces MVM operations to 1/77th of the original, while
maintaining competitive PSNR (35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UniDB框架虽然实现了高保真图像生成，但其依赖迭代欧拉采样方法导致推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有加速技术未能解决其独特挑战。

Method: UniDB++通过推导反向时间SDE的闭式解，减少欧拉近似的误差，并采用数据预测模型和SDE校正机制提升稳定性。

Result: UniDB++在图像恢复任务中表现优异，推理速度提升20倍，同时保持高质量生成。

Conclusion: UniDB++填补了SOC驱动的扩散桥模型在理论通用性和实际效率之间的差距。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridges enable transitions between arbitrary distributions, with
the Unified Diffusion Bridge (UniDB) framework achieving high-fidelity image
generation via a Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) formulation. However, UniDB's
reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally
expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or
diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal
mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present
UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon
these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact
closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the
error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality
generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further
complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data
prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains
perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we
demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration
methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as
special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate
UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks,
outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing
inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical
generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/2769433owo/UniDB-plusplus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在人类运动知识方面的能力，通过3D虚拟角色控制验证其运动规划和执行效果。

Method: 通过高级运动计划和低级身体部位定位两步法生成动画，并设计20个代表性运动指令进行全面评估。

Result: LLMs擅长高级运动解释，但精确身体部位定位和多步骤运动规划表现不佳，但在创意运动和文化特定运动模式上有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在运动规划中表现有限，但在创意和文化特定运动方面具有潜力，需进一步改进精确控制能力。

Abstract: We explore Large Language Models (LLMs)' human motion knowledge through 3D
avatar control. Given a motion instruction, we prompt LLMs to first generate a
high-level movement plan with consecutive steps (High-level Planning), then
specify body part positions in each step (Low-level Planning), which we
linearly interpolate into avatar animations as a clear verification lens for
human evaluators. Through carefully designed 20 representative motion
instructions with full coverage of basic movement primitives and balanced body
part usage, we conduct comprehensive evaluations including human assessment of
both generated animations and high-level movement plans, as well as automatic
comparison with oracle positions in low-level planning. We find that LLMs are
strong at interpreting the high-level body movements but struggle with precise
body part positioning. While breaking down motion queries into atomic
components improves planning performance, LLMs have difficulty with multi-step
movements involving high-degree-of-freedom body parts. Furthermore, LLMs
provide reasonable approximation for general spatial descriptions, but fail to
handle precise spatial specifications in text, and the precise spatial-temporal
parameters needed for avatar control. Notably, LLMs show promise in
conceptualizing creative motions and distinguishing culturally-specific motion
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光LiDAR在散射介质中面临信号复杂性和计算挑战，传统方法难以有效分离光子飞行时间和荧光寿命，限制了其应用效果。

Method: 采用物理指导的MoE框架，结合基于证据的Dirichlet批评模型（EDCs）评估专家输出质量，并通过决策网络自适应融合专家预测。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了荧光LiDAR在散射介质中的性能，为医学和非侵入性检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology
employed for distance and depth estimation across medical, automotive, and
other fields, encounters significant computational challenges in scattering
media. The complex nature of the acquired FLiDAR signal, particularly in such
environments, makes isolating photon time-of-flight (related to target depth)
and intrinsic fluorescence lifetime exceptionally difficult, thus limiting the
effectiveness of current analytical and computational methodologies. To
overcome this limitation, we present a Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
framework tailored for specialized modeling of diverse temporal components. In
contrast to the conventional MoE approaches our expert models are informed by
underlying physics, such as the radiative transport equation governing photon
propagation in scattering media. Central to our approach is EvidenceMoE, which
integrates Evidence-Based Dirichlet Critics (EDCs). These critic models assess
the reliability of each expert's output by providing per-expert quality scores
and corrective feedback. A Decider Network then leverages this information to
fuse expert predictions into a robust final estimate adaptively. We validate
our method using realistically simulated Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR) data for
non-invasive cancer cell depth detection generated from photon transport models
in tissue. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, achieving a
normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.030 for depth estimation and
0.074 for fluorescence lifetime.

TL;DR: FAR框架通过用LSTM等序列模块替换预训练Transformer中的注意力机制，提升推理效率，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制在推理时效率低，尤其是在边缘和嵌入式设备上，而研究发现推理时的注意力冗余较高。

Method: 提出FAR框架，用可学习的序列模块（如LSTM）替换注意力块，并通过蒸馏目标和结构剪枝优化。

Result: 在DeiT视觉Transformer上验证，FAR在ImageNet和下游任务中保持原模型精度，同时减少参数和延迟。

Conclusion: FAR成功保留了注意力模块的语义关系，实现了高效推理。

Abstract: While transformers excel across vision and language pretraining tasks, their
reliance on attention mechanisms poses challenges for inference efficiency,
especially on edge and embedded accelerators with limited parallelism and
memory bandwidth. Hinted by the observed redundancy of attention at inference
time, we hypothesize that though the model learns complicated token dependency
through pretraining, the inference-time sequence-to-sequence mapping in each
attention layer is actually ''simple'' enough to be represented with a much
cheaper function. In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention
Replacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained
transformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an
LSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise
distillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a
family of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate
FAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the
accuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with
reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the
semantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the
transformer's attention module.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在视觉任务（如计数或关系推理）中表现不如人类的原因，并探索改进方法。

Method: 采用认知科学方法，评估VLMs在感知、注意力和记忆等核心认知能力上的表现，并通过视觉-文本解耦分析和针对性微调实验。

Conclusion: VLMs的认知能力仍有提升空间，改进链式思考能力和针对性微调是有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual
understanding in recent years. Yet, they still lag behind human capabilities in
specific visual tasks such as counting or relational reasoning. To understand
the underlying limitations, we adopt methodologies from cognitive science,
analyzing VLM performance along core cognitive axes: Perception, Attention, and
Memory. Using a suite of tasks targeting these abilities, we evaluate
state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o. Our analysis reveals distinct
cognitive profiles: while advanced models approach ceiling performance on some
tasks (e.g. category identification), a significant gap persists, particularly
in tasks requiring spatial understanding or selective attention. Investigating
the source of these failures and potential methods for improvement, we employ a
vision-text decoupling analysis, finding that models struggling with direct
visual reasoning show marked improvement when reasoning over their own
generated text captions. These experiments reveal a strong need for improved
VLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) abilities, even in models that consistently exceed
human performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of targeted
fine-tuning on composite visual reasoning tasks and show that fine-tuning
smaller VLMs substantially improves core cognitive abilities. While this
improvement does not translate to large enhancements on challenging,
out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show broadly that VLM performance on our
datasets strongly correlates with performance on these other benchmarks. Our
work provides a detailed analysis of VLM cognitive strengths and weaknesses and
identifies key bottlenecks in simultaneous perception and reasoning while also
providing an effective and simple solution.

Abstract: The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by
aligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant
solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically
show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to
learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly
model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector
fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant
path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process.
Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical
datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input
pieces are non-overlapped.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation
tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods
struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to
mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets.
In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of
Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single
overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha
layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity,
generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first
large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer
decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare
removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition).
Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion
Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer
decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending
type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs
In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers
without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning
to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on
the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the
effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon
paper acceptance. Our code will be available at:

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过分析令牌共现关系，成功缓解了LVLMs中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with discrete image tokenizers unify
multimodal representations by encoding visual inputs into a finite set of
tokens. Despite their effectiveness, we find that these models still
hallucinate non-existent objects. We hypothesize that this may be due to visual
priors induced during training: When certain image tokens frequently co-occur
in the same spatial regions and represent shared objects, they become strongly
associated with the verbalizations of those objects. As a result, the model may
hallucinate by evoking visually absent tokens that often co-occur with present
ones. To test this assumption, we construct a co-occurrence graph of image
tokens using a segmentation dataset and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN)
with contrastive learning followed by a clustering method to group tokens that
frequently co-occur in similar visual contexts. We find that hallucinations
predominantly correspond to clusters whose tokens dominate the input, and more
specifically, that the visually absent tokens in those clusters show much
higher correlation with hallucinated objects compared to tokens present in the
image. Based on this observation, we propose a hallucination mitigation method
that suppresses the influence of visually absent tokens by modifying latent
image embeddings during generation. Experiments show our method reduces
hallucinations while preserving expressivity. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有Toxic-Continuation范式在缺乏明确毒性信号时效果不佳，需探索更有效的多模态对齐漏洞。

Method: 优化对抗图像，使其在良性条件下诱导模型产生毒性输出，无需依赖已有毒性输入。

Result: B2T方法优于现有方法，支持黑盒迁移，并可与基于文本的jailbreak互补。

Conclusion: 揭示了多模态对齐中未充分探索的漏洞，为jailbreak研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Optimization-based jailbreaks typically adopt the Toxic-Continuation setting
in large vision-language models (LVLMs), following the standard next-token
prediction objective. In this setting, an adversarial image is optimized to
make the model predict the next token of a toxic prompt. However, we find that
the Toxic-Continuation paradigm is effective at continuing already-toxic
inputs, but struggles to induce safety misalignment when explicit toxic signals
are absent. We propose a new paradigm: Benign-to-Toxic (B2T) jailbreak. Unlike
prior work, we optimize adversarial images to induce toxic outputs from benign
conditioning. Since benign conditioning contains no safety violations, the
image alone must break the model's safety mechanisms. Our method outperforms
prior approaches, transfers in black-box settings, and complements text-based
jailbreaks. These results reveal an underexplored vulnerability in multimodal
alignment and introduce a fundamentally new direction for jailbreak approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for analytically calculating the weights and
thresholds of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without using standard
training procedures. The algorithm enables the determination of CNN parameters
based on just 10 selected images from the MNIST dataset, each representing a
digit from 0 to 9. As part of the method, the number of channels in CNN layers
is also derived analytically. A software module was implemented in C++ Builder,
and a series of experiments were conducted using the MNIST dataset. Results
demonstrate that the analytically computed CNN can recognize over half of 1000
handwritten digit images without any training, achieving inference in fractions
of a second. These findings suggest that CNNs can be constructed and applied
directly for classification tasks without training, using purely analytical
computation of weights.

Abstract: Agricultural research has accelerated in recent years, yet farmers often lack
the time and resources for on-farm research due to the demands of crop
production and farm operations. Seed classification offers valuable insights
into quality control, production efficiency, and impurity detection. Early
identification of seed types is critical to reducing the cost and risk
associated with field emergence, which can lead to yield losses or disruptions
in downstream processes like harvesting. Seed sampling supports growers in
monitoring and managing seed quality, improving precision in determining seed
purity levels, guiding management adjustments, and enhancing yield estimations.
This study proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework
for the efficient classification of ten common Brassica seed types. The
approach addresses the inherent challenge of texture similarity in seed images
using a custom-designed CNN architecture. The model's performance was evaluated
against several pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures, with adjustments to
layer configurations for optimized classification. Experimental results using
our collected Brassica seed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model
achieved a high accuracy rate of 93 percent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种厚度感知的3D网格神经网络（T-EMNN），通过整合3D物体的厚度信息，解决了传统网格方法忽略厚度的问题，同时保持了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D静态分析方法主要关注表面拓扑和几何，忽略了物体厚度对行为的影响，导致分析结果不准确。

Method: 提出了T-EMNN框架，结合厚度信息并引入数据驱动的坐标，保持E(3)-等变性或不变性。

Result: 在工业数据集上验证，T-EMNN能准确预测节点级3D变形，有效捕捉厚度效应且计算高效。

Conclusion: T-EMNN为3D静态分析提供了一种高效且准确的新方法，解决了厚度忽略的问题。

Abstract: Mesh-based 3D static analysis methods have recently emerged as efficient
alternatives to traditional computational numerical solvers, significantly
reducing computational costs and runtime for various physics-based analyses.
However, these methods primarily focus on surface topology and geometry, often
overlooking the inherent thickness of real-world 3D objects, which exhibits
high correlations and similar behavior between opposing surfaces. This
limitation arises from the disconnected nature of these surfaces and the
absence of internal edge connections within the mesh. In this work, we propose
a novel framework, the Thickness-aware E(3)-Equivariant 3D Mesh Neural Network
(T-EMNN), that effectively integrates the thickness of 3D objects while
maintaining the computational efficiency of surface meshes. Additionally, we
introduce data-driven coordinates that encode spatial information while
preserving E(3)-equivariance or invariance properties, ensuring consistent and
robust analysis. Evaluations on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the
superior performance of T-EMNN in accurately predicting node-level 3D
deformations, effectively capturing thickness effects while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Abstract: From uncertainty quantification to real-world object detection, we recognize
the importance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in safety-critical
domains such as autonomous driving or medical diagnostics. In machine learning,
ambiguous data plays an important role in various machine learning domains.
Optical illusions present a compelling area of study in this context, as they
offer insight into the limitations of both human and machine perception.
Despite this relevance, optical illusion datasets remain scarce. In this work,
we introduce a novel dataset of optical illusions featuring intermingled animal
pairs designed to evoke perceptual ambiguity. We identify generalizable visual
concepts, particularly gaze direction and eye cues, as subtle yet impactful
features that significantly influence model accuracy. By confronting models
with perceptual ambiguity, our findings underscore the importance of concepts
in visual learning and provide a foundation for studying bias and alignment
between human and machine vision. To make this dataset useful for general
purposes, we generate optical illusions systematically with different concepts
discussed in our bias mitigation section. The dataset is accessible in Kaggle
via

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了视频散景的时序一致性和深度控制问题，为可控光学效果提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion based editing models have enabled realistic
camera simulation and image-based bokeh, but video bokeh remains largely
unexplored. Existing video editing models cannot explicitly control focus
planes or adjust bokeh intensity, limiting their applicability for controllable
optical effects. Moreover, naively extending image-based bokeh methods to video
often results in temporal flickering and unsatisfactory edge blur transitions
due to the lack of temporal modeling and generalization capability. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel one-step video bokeh framework that
converts arbitrary input videos into temporally coherent, depth-aware bokeh
effects. Our method leverages a multi-plane image (MPI) representation
constructed through a progressively widening depth sampling function, providing
explicit geometric guidance for depth-dependent blur synthesis. By conditioning
a single-step video diffusion model on MPI layers and utilizing the strong 3D
priors from pre-trained models such as Stable Video Diffusion, our approach
achieves realistic and consistent bokeh effects across diverse scenes.
Additionally, we introduce a progressive training strategy to enhance temporal
consistency, depth robustness, and detail preservation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, controllable bokeh effects
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation benchmarks.

Result: 在ResponseNet数据集上，OmniResponse在语义内容、视听同步和生成质量上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OmniResponse为多模态对话反馈生成提供了有效解决方案，并发布了新数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Online Multimodal Conversational Response
Generation (OMCRG), a novel task that aims to online generate synchronized
verbal and non-verbal listener feedback, conditioned on the speaker's
multimodal input. OMCRG reflects natural dyadic interactions and poses new
challenges in achieving synchronization between the generated audio and facial
responses of the listener. To address these challenges, we innovatively
introduce text as an intermediate modality to bridge the audio and facial
responses. We hence propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM) that autoregressively generates high-quality multi-modal listener
responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two novel
components: Chrono-Text, which temporally anchors generated text tokens, and
TempoVoice, a controllable online TTS module that produces speech synchronized
with facial reactions. To support further OMCRG research, we present
ResponseNet, a new dataset comprising 696 high-quality dyadic interactions
featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts,
and facial behavior annotations. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on
ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse significantly outperforms baseline
models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and
generation quality.

Conclusion: 该系统具有可扩展性和可靠性，有望推动精准农业的广泛应用。

Abstract: As a social being, we have an intimate bond with the environment. A plethora
of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on
the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support
the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices
often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To
address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach
that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In
this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different
potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to
combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential
diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision
agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide
context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for
crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large
language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive
treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an
easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the
different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the
affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential
remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving
livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis
on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to
improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural
applications in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星和无人机在精准农业中各具优势与局限，卫星覆盖广但分辨率低，无人机分辨率高但成本高且覆盖有限。研究旨在结合两者优势，提供一种经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用超分辨率方法融合卫星和无人机影像，通过光谱扩展将无人机RGB数据延伸至植被红边和近红外区域，生成高分辨率Sentinel-2影像。

Result: 生物量和氮素估算精度分别提高了18%和31%，且无人机数据仅需部分采集，降低了成本。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量且可扩展，适用于农场实际应用，即使在没有卫星数据时也能依赖无人机RGB输入保持有效性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and satellites are key data sources for
precision agriculture, yet each presents trade-offs. Satellite data offer broad
spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage but lack the resolution needed for
many precision farming applications, while UAS provide high spatial detail but
are limited by coverage and cost, especially for hyperspectral data. This study
presents a novel framework that fuses satellite and UAS imagery using
super-resolution methods. By integrating data across spatial, spectral, and
temporal domains, we leverage the strengths of both platforms cost-effectively.
We use estimation of cover crop biomass and nitrogen (N) as a case study to
evaluate our approach. By spectrally extending UAS RGB data to the vegetation
red edge and near-infrared regions, we generate high-resolution Sentinel-2
imagery and improve biomass and N estimation accuracy by 18% and 31%,
respectively. Our results show that UAS data need only be collected from a
subset of fields and time points. Farmers can then 1) enhance the spectral
detail of UAS RGB imagery; 2) increase the spatial resolution by using
satellite data; and 3) extend these enhancements spatially and across the
growing season at the frequency of the satellite flights. Our SRCNN-based
spectral extension model shows considerable promise for model transferability
over other cropping systems in the Upper and Lower Chesapeake Bay regions.
Additionally, it remains effective even when cloud-free satellite data are
unavailable, relying solely on the UAS RGB input. The spatial extension model
produces better biomass and N predictions than models built on raw UAS RGB
images. Once trained with targeted UAS RGB data, the spatial extension model
allows farmers to stop repeated UAS flights. While we introduce
super-resolution advances, the core contribution is a lightweight and scalable
system for affordable on-farm use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像分辨率固定和上下文有限的约束下，难以实现细粒度的跨模态理解，DCLIP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用跨模态Transformer教师模型，通过双向跨注意力机制生成丰富嵌入，指导轻量级学生模型的训练，结合对比学习和余弦相似度目标。

Result: 在少量数据集上训练的DCLIP显著提升了图像-文本检索指标（Recall@K, MAP），同时保留了94%的CLIP零样本分类性能。

Conclusion: DCLIP有效平衡了任务专业化和泛化能力，为高级视觉-语言任务提供了资源高效、领域自适应且细节敏感的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that
enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's
strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically
constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder
their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal
understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student
distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned
to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between
YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These
semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of
a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive
learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only
~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a
fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text
retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's
zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP
effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and
generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and
detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks. Code available at

Motivation: 当前VQA系统在适应真实世界数据偏移（尤其是多模态场景）时面临挑战，现有评估方法多为单模态或特定OOD类型，缺乏对多模态复杂性的深入理解。

Method: 利用十个现有VQA基准（如VQAv2、IV-VQA等），将其分类为ID、近OOD和远OOD数据集，并通过马氏距离量化分布偏移，分析单模态与多模态偏移的交互及模态重要性。

Result: 研究提供了现有鲁棒微调方法的全面比较，并揭示了多模态分布偏移下的关键模式，为开发更鲁棒的微调方法提供了指导。

Conclusion: FRAMES-VQA基准为多模态分布偏移下的VQA任务提供了新的评估工具，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when
adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While
robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current
evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD,
offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this
work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across
Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We
utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA
and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering
uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a
comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then
quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using
uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we
perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and
multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These
analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods
to handle multi-modal distribution shifts. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMTBENCH为未来多模态表格研究提供了高质量资源，并强调了改进模型架构的紧迫性。

Abstract: Multimodal tables those that integrate semi structured data with visual
elements such as charts and maps are ubiquitous across real world domains, yet
they pose a formidable challenge to current vision language models (VLMs).
While Large Language models (LLMs) and VLMs have demonstrated strong
capabilities in text and image understanding, their performance on complex,
real world multimodal table reasoning remains unexplored. To bridge this gap,
we introduce MMTBENCH (Multimodal Table Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of
500 real world multimodal tables drawn from diverse real world sources, with a
total of 4021 question answer pairs. MMTBENCH questions cover four question
types (Explicit, Implicit, Answer Mention, and Visual Based), five reasoning
types (Mathematical, Extrema Identification, Fact Verification, Vision Based,
and Others), and eight table types (Single/Multiple Entity, Maps and Charts
with Entities, Single/Multiple Charts, Maps, and Visualizations). Extensive
evaluation of state of the art models on all types reveals substantial
performance gaps, particularly on questions requiring visual-based reasoning
and multi-step inference. These findings show the urgent need for improved
architectures that more tightly integrate vision and language processing. By
providing a challenging, high-quality resource that mirrors the complexity of
real-world tasks, MMTBENCH underscores its value as a resource for future
research on multimodal tables.

Abstract: Publicly significant images from events hold valuable contextual information,
crucial for journalism and education. However, existing methods often struggle
to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason

surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose
that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances
understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT
(Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric
for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent
approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that
meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their
broader event context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在Vision Transformer（ViT）中，前馈网络（FFN）层是推理延迟的主要来源，而非注意力层。作者提出了一种通道空闲机制，通过结构重参数化优化FFN层，显著降低了延迟，同时保持或提升了模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT的推理延迟问题主要由FFN层引起，尤其是在大规模模型中。优化FFN层可以显著提升ViT的效率。

Method: 提出通道空闲机制，允许部分特征通道绕过非线性激活函数，形成线性路径，实现结构重参数化。

Result: RePaViT系列模型在延迟上显著降低（如RePa-ViT-Large提速66.8%），同时精度有所提升（如+1.7% top-1准确率）。

Conclusion: RePaViT首次在FFN层应用结构重参数化，为高效ViT提供了新方向。

Abstract: We reveal that feedforward network (FFN) layers, rather than attention
layers, are the primary contributors to Vision Transformer (ViT) inference
latency, with their impact signifying as model size increases. This finding
highlights a critical opportunity for optimizing the efficiency of large-scale
ViTs by focusing on FFN layers. In this work, we propose a novel channel idle
mechanism that facilitates post-training structural reparameterization for
efficient FFN layers during testing. Specifically, a set of feature channels
remains idle and bypasses the nonlinear activation function in each FFN layer,
thereby forming a linear pathway that enables structural reparameterization
during inference. This mechanism results in a family of ReParameterizable
Vision Transformers (RePaViTs), which achieve remarkable latency reductions
with acceptable sacrifices (sometimes gains) in accuracy across various ViTs.
The benefits of our method scale consistently with model sizes, demonstrating
greater speed improvements and progressively narrowing accuracy gaps or even
higher accuracies on larger models. In particular, RePa-ViT-Large and
RePa-ViT-Huge enjoy 66.8% and 68.7% speed-ups with +1.7% and +1.1% higher top-1
accuracies under the same training strategy, respectively. RePaViT is the first
to employ structural reparameterization on FFN layers to expedite ViTs to our
best knowledge, and we believe that it represents an auspicious direction for
efficient ViTs. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抽象视觉推理基准仅关注单步推理和最终结果，缺乏对多阶段推理过程的评估，且现有模型表现不佳但原因不明。

Method: 基于RAVEN设计MultiStAR基准，提出MSEval指标评估中间步骤和最终结果的正确性，并在17种代表性MLLMs上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示现有MLLMs在基础感知任务表现良好，但在复杂规则检测阶段仍存在困难。

Conclusion: MultiStAR和MSEval填补了现有评估空白，揭示了MLLMs在抽象视觉推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in general visual
reasoning but remain underexplored in Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR), which
demands higher-order reasoning to identify abstract rules beyond simple
perception. Existing AVR benchmarks focus on single-step reasoning, emphasizing
the end result but neglecting the multi-stage nature of reasoning process. Past
studies found MLLMs struggle with these benchmarks, but it doesn't explain how
they fail. To address this gap, we introduce MultiStAR, a Multi-Stage AVR
benchmark, based on RAVEN, designed to assess reasoning across varying levels
of complexity. Additionally, existing metrics like accuracy only focus on the
final outcomes while do not account for the correctness of intermediate steps.
Therefore, we propose a novel metric, MSEval, which considers the correctness
of intermediate steps in addition to the final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and
open-source MLLMs. The results reveal that while existing MLLMs perform
adequately on basic perception tasks, they continue to face challenges in more
complex rule detection stages.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Cross-modal RAG在检索和生成质量上显著优于现有基线，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: Cross-modal RAG通过子查询感知的检索和生成，有效解决了复杂查询下的图像生成问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific,
fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot
fully capture. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to
address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no
single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We
propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and
images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and
generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a
sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a
Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the
query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to
selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific
subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on
MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal
RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and
generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: 本文为3D点云分类的对抗攻击提供了新的设计思路，显著提升了攻击效果和隐蔽性。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks have become a dominant approach for
evaluating the robustness of point cloud classification models. However,
existing methods often rely on uniform update rules that fail to consider the
heterogeneous nature of point clouds, resulting in excessive and perceptible
perturbations. In this paper, we rethink the design of gradient-based attacks
by analyzing the limitations of conventional gradient update mechanisms and
propose two new strategies to improve both attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility. First, we introduce WAAttack, a novel framework that
incorporates weighted gradients and an adaptive step-size strategy to account
for the non-uniform contribution of points during optimization. This approach
enables more targeted and subtle perturbations by dynamically adjusting updates
according to the local structure and sensitivity of each point. Second, we
propose SubAttack, a complementary strategy that decomposes the point cloud
into subsets and focuses perturbation efforts on structurally critical regions.
Together, these methods represent a principled rethinking of gradient-based
adversarial attacks for 3D point cloud classification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generating highly imperceptible adversarial examples. Code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

*Guangfu Hao,Haojie Wen,Liangxuna Guo,Yang Chen,Yanchao Bi,Shan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低维属性表示的框架，结合视觉工具感知和语言任务理解，显著提升了工具选择任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类灵活的工具选择能力是一种复杂的认知能力，但目前的计算模型尚未充分捕捉这一能力。

Method: 使用视觉编码器（ResNet或ViT）从工具图像中提取属性，同时通过微调的语言模型（GPT-2、LLaMA、DeepSeek）从任务描述中推导所需属性。

Result: 该方法在工具选择任务中达到74%的准确率，显著优于直接工具匹配（20%）和小型多模态模型（21%-58%），且接近更大模型（如GPT-4o）的性能（73%）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种参数高效、可解释的解决方案，模拟了人类工具认知，推动了认知科学理解和工具选择任务的实用应用。

Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that
distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture
this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using
low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and
linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet)
containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes
spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with
natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or
ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models
(GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our
approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly
outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models
(21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o
(73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that
manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation)
consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a
parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool
cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical
applications in tool selection tasks.

TL;DR: FgB2I方法通过细粒度文本作为桥梁，提升脑活动到图像的重建质量，解决了传统方法中细节和语义一致性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脑活动到图像重建方法常因语义信息不足导致细节缺失和语义不一致，FgB2I旨在通过细粒度文本解决这一问题。

Method: FgB2I分为三个阶段：细节增强、细粒度文本解码和基于文本的脑到图像重建，利用视觉语言模型生成细粒度描述，并通过三种奖励指标优化解码过程。

Result: 实验验证了细粒度文本描述的重要性，该方法可集成到现有重建方法中，实现更精细的图像重建。

Conclusion: FgB2I通过引入细粒度文本，显著提升了脑活动到图像重建的细节和语义一致性。

Abstract: Brain-to-Image reconstruction aims to recover visual stimuli perceived by
humans from brain activity. However, the reconstructed visual stimuli often
missing details and semantic inconsistencies, which may be attributed to
insufficient semantic information. To address this issue, we propose an
approach named Fine-grained Brain-to-Image reconstruction (FgB2I), which
employs fine-grained text as bridge to improve image reconstruction. FgB2I
comprises three key stages: detail enhancement, decoding fine-grained text
descriptions, and text-bridged brain-to-image reconstruction. In the
detail-enhancement stage, we leverage large vision-language models to generate
fine-grained captions for visual stimuli and experimentally validate its
importance. We propose three reward metrics (object accuracy, text-image
semantic similarity, and image-image semantic similarity) to guide the language
model in decoding fine-grained text descriptions from fMRI signals. The
fine-grained text descriptions can be integrated into existing reconstruction
methods to achieve fine-grained Brain-to-Image reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPiC是一种高效精确的相机控制学习框架，通过基于首帧可见性的掩码方法生成高质量锚点视频，无需昂贵的相机轨迹标注，并引入轻量级Anchor-ControlNet模块，显著减少训练参数和步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖点云估计生成锚点视频，但存在误差且需要大量相机轨迹标注，资源消耗大。EPiC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过掩码源视频生成高质量锚点视频，结合Anchor-ControlNet模块，无需修改扩散模型主干。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和MiraData上实现SOTA性能，支持零样本泛化到视频到视频场景。

Conclusion: EPiC高效且精确，适用于实际场景，显著降低了资源需求。

Abstract: Recent approaches on 3D camera control in video diffusion models (VDMs) often
create anchor videos to guide diffusion models as a structured prior by
rendering from estimated point clouds following annotated camera trajectories.
However, errors inherent in point cloud estimation often lead to inaccurate
anchor videos. Moreover, the requirement for extensive camera trajectory
annotations further increases resource demands. To address these limitations,
we introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework
that automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive
camera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor
videos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility.
This approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory
annotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to
generate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce
Anchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor
video guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of
backbone model parameters. By combining the proposed anchor video data and
ControlNet module, EPiC achieves efficient training with substantially fewer
parameters, training steps, and less data, without requiring modifications to
the diffusion model backbone typically needed to mitigate rendering
misalignments. Although being trained on masking-based anchor videos, our
method generalizes robustly to anchor videos made with point clouds during
inference, enabling precise 3D-informed camera control. EPiC achieves SOTA
performance on RealEstate10K and MiraData for I2V camera control task,
demonstrating precise and robust camera control ability both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Notably, EPiC also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to
video-to-video scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Look & Mark (L&M) 是一种结合放射科医生注视点和边界框标注的提示策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在胸片报告生成中的性能，减少了临床错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在医学图像分析中存在幻觉和临床错误，限制了其实际应用的可靠性。

Method: 提出L&M策略，结合注视点（Look）和边界框标注（Mark），通过上下文学习提升模型性能，无需重新训练。

Result: L&M显著提升了模型性能，如CXR-LLaVA提升1.2%，LLaVA-Med提升9.2%，并减少了临床错误（平均每报告减少0.43个错误）。

Conclusion: L&M是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，有望提升低资源临床环境中的诊断流程。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced the automation of medical image analysis, particularly
in generating radiology reports from chest X-rays (CXR). However, these models
still suffer from hallucinations and clinically significant errors, limiting
their reliability in real-world applications. In this study, we propose Look &
Mark (L&M), a novel grounding fixation strategy that integrates radiologist eye
fixations (Look) and bounding box annotations (Mark) into the LLM prompting
framework. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, L&M leverages in-context learning
to achieve substantial performance gains without retraining. When evaluated
across multiple domain-specific and general-purpose models, L&M demonstrates
significant gains, including a 1.2% improvement in overall metrics (A.AVG) for
CXR-LLaVA compared to baseline prompting and a remarkable 9.2% boost for
LLaVA-Med. General-purpose models also benefit from L&M combined with
in-context learning, with LLaVA-OV achieving an 87.3% clinical average
performance (C.AVG)-the highest among all models, even surpassing those
explicitly trained for CXR report generation. Expert evaluations further
confirm that L&M reduces clinically significant errors (by 0.43 average errors
per report), such as false predictions and omissions, enhancing both accuracy
and reliability. These findings highlight L&M's potential as a scalable and
efficient solution for AI-assisted radiology, paving the way for improved
diagnostic workflows in low-resource clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAST是一种半监督知识蒸馏框架，通过压缩预训练视觉基础模型（VFM）为紧凑专家模型，利用有限标注和大量未标注数据，显著提升实例分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例分割需要昂贵的像素级标注和大模型，CAST旨在通过半监督知识蒸馏减少标注需求并提升模型效率。

Method: CAST分为三个阶段：1) 通过自训练和对比像素校准进行VFM域适应；2) 通过多目标损失（结合监督学习和伪标签）蒸馏到紧凑学生模型；3) 在标注数据上微调以消除伪标签偏差。核心是实例感知的像素级对比损失。

Result: 在Cityscapes和ADE20K数据集上，CAST的学生模型（比VFM小11倍）性能超过其教师模型（AP分别提升3.4和1.5），并优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: CAST通过对比学习和多阶段蒸馏，有效利用未标注数据，显著提升了实例分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and large models.
We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework
that compresses pretrained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts
using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three
stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM teacher(s) via self-training with
contrastive pixel calibration, (2) distillation into a compact student via a
unified multi-objective loss that couples standard supervision and
pseudo-labels with our instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive term, and (3)
fine-tuning on labeled data to remove residual pseudo-label bias. Central to
CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask
and class scores to mine informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance
margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and
distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage
unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11X smaller student surpasses
its adapted VFM teacher(s) by +3.4 AP (33.9 vs. 30.5) and +1.5 AP (16.7 vs.
15.2) and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“下一事件预测”（NEP）的自监督学习任务，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频输入上的时序推理能力。通过分割视频为过去和未来帧，模型基于过去帧预测未来事件摘要，从而促进时序推理。论文还构建了V1-33K数据集和FutureBench评估基准，验证了NEP的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频任务（如视频问答或视频描述）依赖人工标注或强模型，且常混淆时空信息。为填补这一空白，作者提出NEP任务，利用未来视频片段作为自监督信号，专注于时序推理。

Method: 将视频分割为过去和未来帧，MLLM以过去帧为输入，预测未来事件摘要。构建了V1-33K数据集，并探索了多种视频指令调优策略。

Result: 实验证明NEP是一种可扩展且有效的训练范式，显著提升了MLLMs的时序推理能力。

Conclusion: NEP为MLLMs的时序推理提供了一种自监督解决方案，并通过数据集和评估基准验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Next-token prediction serves as the foundational learning task enabling
reasoning in LLMs. But what should the learning task be when aiming to equip
MLLMs with temporal reasoning capabilities over video inputs? Existing tasks
such as video question answering often rely on annotations from humans or much
stronger MLLMs, while video captioning tends to entangle temporal reasoning
with spatial information. To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction
(NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich,
self-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning. We segment each video into
past and future frames: the MLLM takes the past frames as input and predicts a
summary of events derived from the future frames, thereby encouraging the model
to reason temporally in order to complete the task. To support this task, we
curate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video
segments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of
video instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal
reasoning. To evaluate progress, we introduce FutureBench to assess coherence
in predicting unseen future events. Experiments validate that NEP offers a
scalable and effective training paradigm for fostering temporal reasoning in
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新范式，通过生成中间视觉思考步骤，使大型多模态模型（LMMs）能够在文本和视觉模态间进行跨模态思考，显著提升视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉推理局限于处理固定图像或纯文本链式思考，缺乏动态生成和迭代视觉假设的能力。

Method: 通过两种机制实现：（1）分解复杂视觉任务为可管理的子目标并逐步生成整合；（2）生成初始视觉假设后，通过文本推理分析不足并优化输出。

Result: 在视觉生成基准测试中，相对基线方法提升高达50%（从38%到57%），尤其在复杂多对象场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI模型提供了类似人类的视觉想象和迭代优化能力，适用于生物化学、建筑设计、法医分析等多个领域。

Abstract: We present Thinking with Generated Images, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally transforms how large multimodal models (LMMs) engage with visual
reasoning by enabling them to natively think across text and vision modalities
through spontaneous generation of intermediate visual thinking steps. Current
visual reasoning with LMMs is constrained to either processing fixed
user-provided images or reasoning solely through text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT). Thinking with Generated Images unlocks a new dimension of cognitive
capability where models can actively construct intermediate visual thoughts,
critique their own visual hypotheses, and refine them as integral components of
their reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through two complementary mechanisms: (1) vision generation with intermediate
visual subgoals, where models decompose complex visual tasks into manageable
components that are generated and integrated progressively, and (2) vision
generation with self-critique, where models generate an initial visual
hypothesis, analyze its shortcomings through textual reasoning, and produce
refined outputs based on their own critiques. Our experiments on vision
generation benchmarks show substantial improvements over baseline approaches,
with our models achieving up to 50% (from 38% to 57%) relative improvement in
handling complex multi-object scenarios. From biochemists exploring novel
protein structures, and architects iterating on spatial designs, to forensic
analysts reconstructing crime scenes, and basketball players envisioning
strategic plays, our approach enables AI models to engage in the kind of visual
imagination and iterative refinement that characterizes human creative,
analytical, and strategic thinking. We release our open-source suite at

Motivation: 现有图像描述增强方法因幻觉和细节缺失导致不准确，RICO旨在通过视觉重建解决这些问题。

Method: RICO通过文本到图像模型重建参考图像，并利用MLLM识别原始与重建图像的差异以迭代优化描述；RICO-Flash通过DPO学习生成类似RICO的描述以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明RICO在CapsBench和CompreCap上显著优于基线方法约10%。

Conclusion: RICO通过视觉重建迭代优化描述，显著提升准确性和完整性，同时RICO-Flash降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Image recaptioning is widely used to generate training datasets with enhanced
quality for various multimodal tasks. Existing recaptioning methods typically
rely on powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance textual
descriptions, but often suffer from inaccuracies due to hallucinations and
incompleteness caused by missing fine-grained details. To address these
limitations, we propose RICO, a novel framework that refines captions through
visual reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage a text-to-image model to
reconstruct a caption into a reference image, and prompt an MLLM to identify
discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images to refine the
caption. This process is performed iteratively, further progressively promoting
the generation of more faithful and comprehensive descriptions. To mitigate the
additional computational cost induced by the iterative process, we introduce
RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves caption
accuracy and completeness, outperforms most baselines by approximately 10% on
both CapsBench and CompreCap. Code released at

TL;DR: UniTalk是一个专为主动说话人检测任务设计的新数据集，强调挑战性场景以提升模型泛化能力。与现有基准（如AVA）不同，它涵盖多样化的真实场景，包括多语言、嘈杂背景和拥挤场景。实验表明，现有模型在UniTalk上表现不佳，但训练后的模型在其他数据集上泛化能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动说话人检测数据集（如AVA）主要基于老电影，存在显著的领域差距。UniTalk旨在填补这一空白，提供更贴近真实世界挑战的数据集。

Method: UniTalk包含44.5小时视频，涵盖48,693个说话人身份，标注了帧级主动说话人信息，覆盖多样化的视频类型和复杂场景。

Result: 现有模型在AVA上表现优异，但在UniTalk上未能达到饱和，表明真实条件下的任务尚未解决。然而，UniTalk训练的模型在Talkies、ASW和AVA上表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniTalk为主动说话人检测提供了新的基准，有助于开发更具适应性和鲁棒性的模型。

Abstract: We present UniTalk, a novel dataset specifically designed for the task of
active speaker detection, emphasizing challenging scenarios to enhance model
generalization. Unlike previously established benchmarks such as AVA, which
predominantly features old movies and thus exhibits significant domain gaps,
UniTalk focuses explicitly on diverse and difficult real-world conditions.
These include underrepresented languages, noisy backgrounds, and crowded scenes
- such as multiple visible speakers speaking concurrently or in overlapping
turns. It contains over 44.5 hours of video with frame-level active speaker
annotations across 48,693 speaking identities, and spans a broad range of video
types that reflect real-world conditions. Through rigorous evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art models, while achieving nearly perfect scores on AVA,
fail to reach saturation on UniTalk, suggesting that the ASD task remains far
from solved under realistic conditions. Nevertheless, models trained on UniTalk
demonstrate stronger generalization to modern "in-the-wild" datasets like
Talkies and ASW, as well as to AVA. UniTalk thus establishes a new benchmark
for active speaker detection, providing researchers with a valuable resource
for developing and evaluating versatile and resilient models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理任务中存在对错误敏感、依赖大量标注数据或验证器、泛化能力有限等问题。

Method: Sherlock通过轨迹级自校正目标、基于视觉扰动的偏好数据构建方法以及动态β偏好调优，实现模型的自校正和自改进。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，Sherlock平均准确率达到64.1（直接生成）和65.4（自校正后），优于其他模型且仅需20%的标注数据。

Conclusion: Sherlock通过自校正显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，减少了对外部监督的依赖。

Abstract: Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on
complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they
are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated
data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains.
To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to
enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning
VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings,
we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training
framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a
preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic
$\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction
capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to
self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B
model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching
an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after
self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and
LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角在空间或上下文复杂查询中的局限性，通过结合第三人称视角提供全局场景信息。

Method: 引入E3VQA基准（4K问答对）和M3CoT提示技术，整合多视角场景图以构建统一场景表示。

Result: M3CoT显著提升了LVLMs在多视角推理中的性能（GPT-4o提升4.84%，Gemini 2.0 Flash提升5.94%）。

Conclusion: 结合第一人称和第三人称视角能有效提升LVLMs的多视角推理能力，揭示了其优势和局限性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive
applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where first-person
(egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While
this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object
interactions, their narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead
to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we
introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person
(exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene
layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark
for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs
grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a
training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene
representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary
perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views,
yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini
2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key
strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the
value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在动态多房间3D环境中规划和行动能力有限，主要原因是缺乏有效的3D空间-时间记忆建模。

Method: 提出3DLLM-Mem模型，利用工作记忆令牌选择性融合来自情景记忆的空间和时间特征。

Result: 3DLLM-Mem在3DMem-Bench基准测试中表现优异，在最具挑战性的任务上成功率比基线高16.5%。

Conclusion: 3DLLM-Mem通过动态记忆管理显著提升了LLMs在复杂3D环境中的推理和行动能力。

Abstract: Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory
across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D
environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of
proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first
introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000
trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning,
designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D
environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management
and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs.
Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as
queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal
features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions.
Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while
maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by
16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied
tasks.

Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal
representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding
space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are
significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate
that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired
data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk
matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical
results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its
potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful
cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks,
generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work,
to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities
almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal
embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific
modalities of the data. Our code IS publicly available at

*Thalles Silva,Helio Pedrini,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SOP的无监督视觉特征学习新方法，通过多个语义相似的表示（SEs）替代单一原型，提升训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法依赖单一原型编码隐藏簇的特征，限制了性能。SOP旨在通过多支持嵌入（SEs）更全面地表征数据区域。

Method: 提出SOP策略，引入非参数化损失函数，并设计SOP-MIM任务，通过多局部SEs重建掩码表示。

Result: 在检索、线性评估、微调和目标检测等任务中，SOP预训练编码器表现优异，尤其在复杂编码器上性能提升显著。

Conclusion: SOP策略通过多支持嵌入和非参数化方法，显著提升了无监督视觉特征学习的性能。

Abstract: We present Self-Organizing Visual Prototypes (SOP), a new training technique
for unsupervised visual feature learning. Unlike existing prototypical
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods that rely on a single prototype to
encode all relevant features of a hidden cluster in the data, we propose the
SOP strategy. In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically
similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a
complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in
space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of
non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss
functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked
Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed
from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively
evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of
benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object
detection. Our pre-trained encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on
many retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate increasing performance gains with
more complex encoders.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种视频检索增强生成（VRAG）方法，通过显式全局状态条件化减少长期复合错误，提升世界模型的时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频生成模型因复合错误和记忆机制不足，缺乏有效的世界建模能力，限制了未来规划和动作选择的效果。

Method: 通过动作条件和自回归框架增强图像到视频模型的交互能力，并提出VRAG方法，结合显式全局状态条件化。

Result: VRAG显著减少了长期复合错误，提高了世界模型的时空一致性，而传统的自回归生成和检索增强生成效果较差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频世界模型的基本挑战，并为提升视频生成模型的世界建模能力提供了基准。

Abstract: Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve
spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices.
However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world
modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and
insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with
interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and
autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently
irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory
mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval
augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which
significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal
consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with
extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less
effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context
learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the
fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive
benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAT-LVDM是一种针对潜在视频扩散模型（LVDMs）的鲁棒性训练框架，通过数据对齐的噪声注入提升模型性能，尤其在噪声丰富的网络视频-文本数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVDMs在生成高质量视频时对不完美的条件输入敏感，容易导致语义漂移和时间不一致。为了解决这一问题，研究提出了CAT-LVDM框架。

Method: CAT-LVDM包含两种噪声注入方法：Batch-Centered Noise Injection（BCNI）和Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise（SACN）。BCNI通过扰动批次内语义方向保持时间一致性，而SACN通过注入低频噪声提升平滑性。

Result: 实验表明，BCNI在WebVid-2M、MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上平均降低FVD 31.9%，SACN在UCF-101上提升12.3%。理论分析进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CAT-LVDM为多模态噪声下的鲁棒视频扩散提供了一种可扩展的训练方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) achieve high-quality generation but are
sensitive to imperfect conditioning, which causes semantic drift and temporal
incoherence on noisy, web-scale video-text datasets. We introduce CAT-LVDM, the
first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness
through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes
Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along
intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is
especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and
MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects
noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness,
showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across
WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101.
Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our
theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy,
Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM
establishes a principled, scalable training approach for robust video diffusion
under multimodal noise. Code and models: https://github.com/chikap421/catlvdm

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单退化修复或灰度图像处理，无法满足多退化彩色文档图像的需求，因此提出GL-PGENet以提升效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用分层增强框架，结合全局校正与局部细化；提出双分支局部细化网络，通过参数化生成机制替代直接预测；改进NestUNet架构，融合低层像素特征与高层语义特征；采用两阶段训练策略（大规模预训练+任务微调）。

Conclusion: GL-PGENet在多退化彩色文档图像增强任务中表现卓越，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Document Image Enhancement (DIE) serves as a critical component in Document
AI systems, where its performance substantially determines the effectiveness of
downstream tasks. To address the limitations of existing methods confined to
single-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global
with Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel
architecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both
efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates
three key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that
integrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling
coarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network
with parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct
prediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric
representations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local
consistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet
architecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel
features and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document
image characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we
adopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
dataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving
state-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE. The
model also exhibits remarkable cross-domain adaptability and maintains
computational efficiency for high-resolution images without performance
degradation, confirming its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为平衡令牌剪枝（BTP）的方法，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的图像令牌数量，以降低计算开销。该方法通过分阶段剪枝，平衡局部和全局影响，显著提升了剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在处理多模态任务时，因图像令牌数量庞大导致计算开销高。现有剪枝方法未充分考虑剪枝对当前层和后续层的联合影响，导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出平衡令牌剪枝（BTP），利用校准集将剪枝分为多个阶段：早期阶段关注剪枝对后续层的影响，后期阶段注重保持局部输出一致性。

Result: 实验表明，BTP在多个基准测试中表现优异，平均压缩率达78%，同时保留96.7%的原始模型性能。

Conclusion: BTP是一种高效的令牌剪枝方法，显著降低了LVLM的计算开销，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across
multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the
large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and
the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden.
Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through
token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image
token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods
often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output
(local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal
pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning
(BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our
method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into
multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of
pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts
toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments
across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on
multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while
preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average.

Method: 使用双模型架构（教师模型和学生模型），通过新设计的损失函数和梯度注意力空间映射实现知识蒸馏，学生模型直接处理未裁剪图像。

Result: 框架实现了稳健的诊断准确性，形成临床可行的端到端流程，无需额外预处理工具。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了骨骼成熟度评估的效率和一致性，适用于多样化临床环境。

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework for the automated staging of
spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) fusion, a critical diagnostic marker in
both orthodontics and forensic anthropology. Our approach leverages a
dual-model architecture wherein a teacher model, trained on manually cropped
images, transfers its precise spatial understanding to a student model that
operates on full, uncropped images. This knowledge distillation is facilitated
by a newly formulated loss function that aligns spatial logits as well as
incorporates gradient-based attention spatial mapping, ensuring that the
student model internalizes the anatomically relevant features without relying
on external cropping or YOLO-based segmentation. By leveraging expert-curated
data and feedback at each step, our framework attains robust diagnostic
accuracy, culminating in a clinically viable end-to-end pipeline. This
streamlined approach obviates the need for additional pre-processing tools and
accelerates deployment, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and consistency
of skeletal maturation assessment in diverse clinical settings.

Conclusion: SERA通过自适应场景推荐和少样本学习，为自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性和泛化性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring robust and generalizable autonomous driving requires not only broad
scenario coverage but also efficient repair of failure cases, particularly
those related to challenging and safety-critical scenarios. However, existing
scenario generation and selection methods often lack adaptivity and semantic
relevance, limiting their impact on performance improvement. In this paper, we
propose \textbf{SERA}, an LLM-powered framework that enables autonomous driving
systems to self-evolve by repairing failure cases through targeted scenario
recommendation. By analyzing performance logs, SERA identifies failure patterns
and dynamically retrieves semantically aligned scenarios from a structured
bank. An LLM-based reflection mechanism further refines these recommendations
to maximize relevance and diversity. The selected scenarios are used for
few-shot fine-tuning, enabling targeted adaptation with minimal data.
Experiments on the benchmark show that SERA consistently improves key metrics
across multiple autonomous driving baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness
and generalizability under safety-critical conditions.

Motivation: 在脑血肿CT的多实例学习中，当每个包中的实例数量增加到256时，传统深度学习方法难以有效训练。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自监督学习预训练模型作为多实例学习器的下游任务，以克服原始任务中的虚假相关性问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在脑血肿CT的低密度标记分类任务中，准确率提升了5%至13%，F1分数提升了40%至55%。

Conclusion: 通过自监督学习预训练模型，可以有效解决多实例学习中因实例数量增加导致的训练困难问题，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: In deep multi-instance learning, the number of applicable instances depends
on the data set. In histopathology images, deep learning multi-instance
learners usually assume there are hundreds to thousands instances in a bag.
However, when the number of instances in a bag increases to 256 in brain
hematoma CT, learning becomes extremely difficult. In this paper, we address
this drawback. To overcome this problem, we propose using a pre-trained model
with self-supervised learning for the multi-instance learner as a downstream
task. With this method, even when the original target task suffers from the
spurious correlation problem, we show improvements of 5% to 13% in accuracy and
40% to 55% in the F1 measure for the hypodensity marker classification of brain
hematoma CT.

Motivation: 当前AI动作捕捉方法依赖预定义视频序列，无法处理未观察到的动作。论文旨在通过生成连续动作片段，提升虚拟人动作的灵活性。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的运动补全技术，结合门模块和位置-时间嵌入模块，生成平滑连续的动作序列。

Result: MDC-Net在Human3.6M数据集上表现优于现有方法（ADE、FDE、MMADE），模型更小（16.84M），且生成的动作更自然连贯。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动作片段间过渡问题，为虚拟人动作捕捉提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based motion capture is an emerging technology that offers a
cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However,
current AI motion capture methods rely entirely on observed video sequences,
similar to conventional motion capture. This means that all human actions must
be predefined, and movements outside the observed sequences are not possible.
To address this limitation, we aim to apply AI motion capture to virtual
humans, where flexible actions beyond the observed sequences are required. We
assume that while many action fragments exist in the training data, the
transitions between them may be missing. To bridge these gaps, we propose a
diffusion-model-based action completion technique that generates complementary
human motion sequences, ensuring smooth and continuous movements. By
introducing a gate module and a position-time embedding module, our approach
achieves competitive results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our experimental results
show that (1) MDC-Net outperforms existing methods in ADE, FDE, and MMADE but
is slightly less accurate in MMFDE, (2) MDC-Net has a smaller model size
(16.84M) compared to HumanMAC (28.40M), and (3) MDC-Net generates more natural
and coherent motion sequences. Additionally, we propose a method for extracting
sensor data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from human motion
sequences.

Result: EaqVLA在量化损失最小化和计算加速方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EaqVLA有效解决了VLA模型量化中的对齐问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end
control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the
mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which
need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method
which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation
acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the
application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an
optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to
VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the
misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose
a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment.
Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization
performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control
and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在通过扩散模型增强训练数据时难以平衡生成多样性与性能提升，且需要大幅增加数据量。

Method: 分析双层CNN，证明仅增强部分未在训练早期学习的数据可促进特征学习速度的均匀性，避免噪声放大。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet上，仅增强30%-40%数据即可提升性能2.8%，且优于SOTA优化器SAM。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且兼容现有增强策略，为数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an
effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However,
existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase
the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution
performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the
data that is not learned early in training outperforms augmenting the entire
dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves
generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without
amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only
30%-40% of the data, our method boosts the performance by up to 2.8% in a
variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT and DenseNet on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, with a range of optimizers including SGD and SAM.
Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on
CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet. It can also easily stack with existing weak and
strong augmentation strategies to further boost the performance.

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要更先进的推理驱动视觉生成能力。

Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid advances in AI-driven image generation. Early
diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models
like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic
understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation
exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate
interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into
clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more
knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and
specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would
provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to
evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first
benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances
curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science
disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated
along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy.
Experimental results reveal that even top-tier models like GPT-4o-image lag
behind human performance, with common issues in text/visual clarity and
scientific correctness. These findings highlight the need for more advanced
reasoning-driven visual generation capabilities.

Conclusion: FaceEditTalker在面部属性编辑和视频生成方面表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved
impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However,
they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This
capability is crucial for achieving deep personalization and expanding the
range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars,
engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service.
In these key domains, the flexible adjustment of visual attributes-such as
hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features is essential for aligning
with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities, and adapting to
varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified
framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while
generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method
consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which
extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over
attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven
video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided
facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures
temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in lip-sync accuracy, video quality,
and attribute controllability. Project page:

Result: 该方法在性能上持续优于现有最先进技术，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 查询特定的特征变换是一种高效且可扩展的大规模图像检索解决方案。

Abstract: Massive-scale pretraining has made vision-language models increasingly
popular for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval across a broad
collection of domains. However, these models do not perform well when used for
challenging retrieval tasks, such as instance retrieval in very large-scale
image collections. Recent work has shown that linear transformations of VLM
features trained for instance retrieval can improve performance by emphasizing
subspaces that relate to the domain of interest. In this paper, we explore a
more extreme version of this specialization by learning to map a given query to
a query-specific feature space transformation. Because this transformation is
linear, it can be applied with minimal computational cost to millions of image
embeddings, making it effective for large-scale retrieval or re-ranking.
Results show that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
alternatives, including those that require many orders of magnitude more
computation at query time.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中图像与文本绑定的机制，提出了一种Binding ID机制，用于关联图像中的物体与其文本描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型如何通过Binding ID机制在图像和文本之间建立关联，以提升模型对多模态信息的理解能力。

Method: 使用合成数据集和任务，研究VLMs如何为图像中的物体及其文本描述分配Binding ID，以实现上下文关联。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs能够为物体图像标记及其文本引用分配独特的Binding ID，从而实现上下文关联。

Conclusion: Binding ID机制在VLMs中有效，能够帮助模型在多模态任务中建立图像与文本的关联。

Abstract: To understand a prompt, Vision-Language models (VLMs) must perceive the
image, comprehend the text, and build associations within and across both
modalities. For instance, given an 'image of a red toy car', the model should
associate this image to phrases like 'car', 'red toy', 'red object', etc. Feng
and Steinhardt propose the Binding ID mechanism in LLMs, suggesting that the
entity and its corresponding attribute tokens share a Binding ID in the model
activations. We investigate this for image-text binding in VLMs using a
synthetic dataset and task that requires models to associate 3D objects in an
image with their descriptions in the text. Our experiments demonstrate that
VLMs assign a distinct Binding ID to an object's image tokens and its textual
references, enabling in-context association.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“矩核”的简单卷积核形式，用于实现旋转和反射等对称性的等变性，并证明所有等变核必须采取这种形式。该方法简化了传统依赖复杂数学工具的方法，并在生物医学图像分析任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转和反射等对称性在生物医学图像分析中至关重要，但传统方法依赖复杂的数学工具（如表示理论），限制了其广泛应用。论文旨在简化这些对称性的利用方法。

Method: 提出“矩核”作为简单卷积核形式，由径向对称函数与空间位置分量的幂次或单位矩阵相乘构成。通过标准卷积模块实现等变神经网络。

Conclusion: 矩核提供了一种简单而通用的方法来实现对称性等变性，避免了传统方法的复杂性，为生物医学图像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: The principle of translation equivariance (if an input image is translated an
output image should be translated by the same amount), led to the development
of convolutional neural networks that revolutionized machine vision. Other
symmetries, like rotations and reflections, play a similarly critical role,
especially in biomedical image analysis, but exploiting these symmetries has
not seen wide adoption. We hypothesize that this is partially due to the
mathematical complexity of methods used to exploit these symmetries, which
often rely on representation theory, a bespoke concept in differential geometry
and group theory. In this work, we show that the same equivariance can be
achieved using a simple form of convolution kernels that we call ``moment
kernels,'' and prove that all equivariant kernels must take this form. These
are a set of radially symmetric functions of a spatial position $x$, multiplied
by powers of the components of $x$ or the identity matrix. We implement
equivariant neural networks using standard convolution modules, and provide
architectures to execute several biomedical image analysis tasks that depend on
equivariance principles: classification (outputs are invariant under orthogonal
transforms), 3D image registration (outputs transform like a vector), and cell
segmentation (quadratic forms defining ellipses transform like a matrix).

TL;DR: 对抗训练在扩散模型中与分类器中的表现不同，扩散模型中的对抗训练需要保持等变性以对齐数据分布，从而提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗训练在扩散模型中的作用，揭示其与分类器中的不同，并提出一种无需假设噪声模型的方法。

Method: 通过在扩散训练中添加随机噪声或对抗噪声，实现平滑扩散流，提升对噪声、异常值和数据损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在低维和高维数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并在标准基准测试中表现出色，能够应对严重噪声、数据损坏和对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的对抗训练通过等变性提升鲁棒性，为处理噪声和异常数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: We answer the question in the title, showing that adversarial training (AT)
for diffusion models (DMs) fundamentally differs from classifiers: while AT in
classifiers enforces output invariance, AT in DMs requires equivariance to keep
the diffusion process aligned with the data distribution. AT is a way to
enforce smoothness in the diffusion flow, improving robustness to outliers and
corrupted data. Unlike prior art, our method makes no assumptions about the
noise model and integrates seamlessly into diffusion training by adding random
noise, similar to randomized smoothing, or adversarial noise, akin to AT. This
enables intrinsic capabilities such as handling noisy data, dealing with
extreme variability such as outliers, preventing memorization, and improving
robustness. We rigorously evaluate our approach with proof-of-concept datasets
with known distributions in low- and high-dimensional space, thereby taking a
perfect measure of errors; we further evaluate on standard benchmarks such as
CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN Bedroom, showing strong performance under severe
noise, data corruption, and iterative adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 早期视觉艺术（尤其是彩色照片）因老化和不当存储导致模糊、划痕、颜色渗色和褪色等问题，需要高效修复方法。

Method: 通过合成数据集生成和生成AI技术，设计了改进的加权损失函数以处理颜色不平衡问题。

Result: 该方法能够高效修复绿色缺陷，减少时间需求，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为视觉艺术的自动修复提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is
challenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to
issues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. In this
paper, we present the first approach for the automatic removal of greening
color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. Our main contributions
include a method based on synthetic dataset generation and the use of
generative AI with a carefully designed loss function for the restoration of
visual arts. To address the lack of suitable training datasets for analyzing
greening defects in damaged autochromes, we introduce a novel approach for
accurately simulating such defects in synthetic data. We also propose a
modified weighted loss function for the ChaIR method to account for color
imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. While existing methods
struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require
significant manual effort, our method allows for efficient restoration with
reduced time requirements.

Motivation: 现有运动生成方法依赖特定骨架结构，限制了其通用性。UniMoGen旨在克服这一限制，实现骨架无关的运动生成。

Method: UniMoGen采用UNet架构的扩散模型，动态处理不同角色的关节，支持风格和轨迹输入控制，并能延续历史帧运动。

Result: 在100style数据集上，UniMoGen优于现有方法；在100style和LAFAN1数据集上训练后，表现出高性能和高效性。

Conclusion: UniMoGen为角色动画提供了灵活、高效且可控的运动生成方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Motion generation is a cornerstone of computer graphics, animation, gaming,
and robotics, enabling the creation of realistic and varied character
movements. A significant limitation of existing methods is their reliance on
specific skeletal structures, which restricts their versatility across
different characters. To overcome this, we introduce UniMoGen, a novel
UNet-based diffusion model designed for skeleton-agnostic motion generation.
UniMoGen can be trained on motion data from diverse characters, such as humans
and animals, without the need for a predefined maximum number of joints. By
dynamically processing only the necessary joints for each character, our model
achieves both skeleton agnosticism and computational efficiency. Key features
of UniMoGen include controllability via style and trajectory inputs, and the
ability to continue motions from past frames. We demonstrate UniMoGen's
effectiveness on the 100style dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in diverse character motion generation. Furthermore, when trained on
both the 100style and LAFAN1 datasets, which use different skeletons, UniMoGen
achieves high performance and improved efficiency across both skeletons. These
results highlight UniMoGen's potential to advance motion generation by
providing a flexible, efficient, and controllable solution for a wide range of
character animations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了VME数据集和CDSI基准数据集，用于解决卫星图像中车辆检测的地理偏差问题，特别是在中东地区。实验表明，VME显著提高了中东地区的检测准确性，而CDSI提升了全球车辆检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有数据集存在地理偏差，忽视了中东地区，导致车辆检测模型在该区域表现不佳。

Method: 创建了VME数据集（覆盖中东12国的54个城市，含100,000+车辆标注）和CDSI基准数据集（整合多源图像）。

Result: VME显著提升了中东地区的车辆检测准确性；CDSI训练的模型在全球范围内表现更优。

Conclusion: VME和CDSI数据集填补了地理偏差的空白，为车辆检测提供了更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in satellite images is crucial for traffic management,
urban planning, and disaster response. However, current models struggle with
real-world diversity, particularly across different regions. This challenge is
amplified by geographic bias in existing datasets, which often focus on
specific areas and overlook regions like the Middle East. To address this gap,
we present the Vehicles in the Middle East (VME) dataset, designed explicitly
for vehicle detection in high-resolution satellite images from Middle Eastern
countries. Sourced from Maxar, the VME dataset spans 54 cities across 12
countries, comprising over 4,000 image tiles and more than 100,000 vehicles,
annotated using both manual and semi-automated methods. Additionally, we
introduce the largest benchmark dataset for Car Detection in Satellite Imagery
(CDSI), combining images from multiple sources to enhance global car detection.
Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on existing datasets perform
poorly on Middle Eastern images, while the VME dataset significantly improves
detection accuracy in this region. Moreover, state-of-the-art models trained on
CDSI achieve substantial improvements in global car detection.

Result: DAM在域内、域外和跨架构性能上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MDDC通过DAM有效提升了数据集压缩在多域场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dataset Condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the
computational and storage burdens associated with training deep learning
models. However, existing DC methods largely overlook the multi-domain nature
of modern datasets, which are increasingly composed of heterogeneous images
spanning multiple domains. In this paper, we extend DC and introduce
Multi-Domain Dataset Condensation (MDDC), which aims to condense data that
generalizes across both single-domain and multi-domain settings. To this end,
we propose the Domain-Aware Module (DAM), a training-time module that embeds
domain-related features into each synthetic image via learnable spatial masks.
As explicit domain labels are mostly unavailable in real-world datasets, we
employ frequency-based pseudo-domain labeling, which leverages low-frequency
amplitude statistics. DAM is only active during the condensation process, thus
preserving the same images per class (IPC) with prior methods. Experiments show
that DAM consistently improves in-domain, out-of-domain, and cross-architecture
performance over baseline dataset condensation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF技术用于3D场景视图合成，但多路径信号（如WiFi）包含复杂的环境反射信息，能否利用这些信号推断环境布局是一个挑战。

Method: 通过重新设计NeRF模型，使其能够学习多路径信号（如WiFi测量数据），从而推断室内环境布局。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够从稀疏的WiFi测量数据中学习到隐含的室内平面图，并支持信号预测和基本光线追踪等应用。

Conclusion: 研究表明，NeRF技术可以扩展至多路径信号领域，为环境推断提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been remarkably successful at
synthesizing novel views of 3D scenes by optimizing a volumetric scene
function. This scene function models how optical rays bring color information
from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals
can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the
environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor
receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also
called "multipath"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such
multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn
from multipath signals, and thereby "see" the environment. As a grounding
application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi
measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult
inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables
forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.

Conclusion: 该框架在非刚性配准和部分形状匹配中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework for 3D shape
registration, which overcomes the challenges of significant non-rigid
deformation and partiality undergoing among input shapes, and, remarkably,
requires no correspondence annotation during training. Our key insight is to
incorporate neural features learned by deep learning-based shape matching
networks into an iterative, geometric shape registration pipeline. The
advantage of our approach is two-fold -- On one hand, neural features provide
more accurate and semantically meaningful correspondence estimation than
spatial features (e.g., coordinates), which is critical in the presence of
large non-rigid deformations; On the other hand, the correspondences are
dynamically updated according to the intermediate registrations and filtered by
consistency prior, which prominently robustify the overall pipeline. Empirical
results show that, with as few as dozens of training shapes of limited
variability, our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on several
benchmarks of non-rigid point cloud matching and partial shape matching across
varying settings, but also delivers high-quality correspondences between unseen
challenging shape pairs that undergo both significant extrinsic and intrinsic
deformations, in which case neither traditional registration methods nor
intrinsic methods work.

Motivation: 传统对抗性UDA框架仅依赖分布对齐和源域经验风险最小化，忽视了目标域特征的可判别性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了RLGLC方法，结合域不变表示学习和全局局部一致性，利用AR-WWD解决类别不平衡和语义维度加权问题，并通过局部一致性机制保留目标域的细粒度判别信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，RLGLC方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在对抗性UDA中同时保证可迁移性和可判别性的必要性，RLGLC方法的有效性验证了理论分析的正确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we addressed the limitation of relying solely on distribution
alignment and source-domain empirical risk minimization in Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation (UDA). Our information-theoretic analysis showed that this standard
adversarial-based framework neglects the discriminability of target-domain
features, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this
theoretical-practical gap, we defined "good representation learning" as
guaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an
additional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary.
Building on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework
that explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a
discriminability-enhancing constraint. Instantiated as Domain-Invariant
Representation Learning with Global and Local Consistency (RLGLC), our method
leverages Asymmetrically-Relaxed Wasserstein of Wasserstein Distance (AR-WWD)
to address class imbalance and semantic dimension weighting, and employs a
local consistency mechanism to preserve fine-grained target-domain
discriminative information. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RLGLC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, confirming the value of our theoretical perspective and underscoring
the necessity of enforcing both transferability and discriminability in
adversarial-based UDA.

Abstract: The data scaling law has been shown to significantly enhance the performance
of large multi-modal models (LMMs) across various downstream tasks. However, in
the domain of perceptual video quality assessment (VQA), the potential of
scaling law remains unprecedented due to the scarcity of labeled resources and
the insufficient scale of datasets. To address this, we propose
\textbf{OmniVQA}, an efficient framework designed to efficiently build
high-quality, human-in-the-loop VQA multi-modal instruction databases (MIDBs).
We then scale up to create \textbf{OmniVQA-Chat-400K}, the largest MIDB in the
VQA field concurrently. Our focus is on the technical and aesthetic quality
dimensions, with abundant in-context instruction data to provide fine-grained
VQA knowledge. Additionally, we have built the \textbf{OmniVQA-MOS-20K} dataset
to enhance the model's quantitative quality rating capabilities. We then
introduce a \textbf{complementary} training strategy that effectively leverages
the knowledge from datasets for quality understanding and quality rating tasks.
Furthermore, we propose the \textbf{OmniVQA-FG (fine-grain)-Benchmark} to
evaluate the fine-grained performance of the models. Our results demonstrate
that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in both quality
understanding and rating tasks.

Abstract: Video dataset condensation has emerged as a critical technique for addressing
the computational challenges associated with large-scale video data processing
in deep learning applications. While significant progress has been made in
image dataset condensation, the video domain presents unique challenges due to
the complex interplay between spatial content and temporal dynamics. This paper
introduces PRISM, Progressive Refinement and Insertion for Sparse Motion, for
video dataset condensation, a novel approach that fundamentally reconsiders how
video data should be condensed. Unlike the previous method that separates
static content from dynamic motion, our method preserves the essential
interdependence between these elements. Our approach progressively refines and
inserts frames to fully accommodate the motion in an action while achieving
better performance but less storage, considering the relation of gradients for
each frame. Extensive experiments across standard video action recognition
benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing disentangled approaches
while maintaining compact representations suitable for resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: Tactile perception is essential for embodied agents to understand physical
attributes of objects that cannot be determined through visual inspection
alone. While existing approaches have made progress in visual and language
modalities for physical understanding, they fail to effectively incorporate
tactile information that provides crucial haptic feedback for real-world
interaction. In this paper, we present VTV-LLM, the first multi-modal large
language model for universal Visuo-Tactile Video (VTV) understanding that
bridges the gap between tactile perception and natural language. To address the
challenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K,
a comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse
objects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT,
and Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness,
protrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training
paradigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation,
VTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning
for natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile
reasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis,
scenario-based decision making and so on. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VTV-LLM achieves superior performance in tactile video understanding
tasks, establishing a foundation for more intuitive human-machine interaction
in tactile domains.

Abstract: Deepfake generation methods are evolving fast, making fake media harder to
detect and raising serious societal concerns. Most deepfake detection and
dataset creation research focuses on monolingual content, often overlooking the
challenges of multilingual and code-switched speech, where multiple languages
are mixed within the same discourse. Code-switching, especially between Arabic
and English, is common in the Arab world and is widely used in digital
communication. This linguistic mixing poses extra challenges for deepfake
detection, as it can confuse models trained mostly on monolingual data. To
address this, we introduce \textbf{ArEnAV}, the first large-scale
Arabic-English audio-visual deepfake dataset featuring intra-utterance
code-switching, dialectal variation, and monolingual Arabic content. It
\textbf{contains 387k videos and over 765 hours of real and fake videos}. Our
dataset is generated using a novel pipeline integrating four Text-To-Speech and
two lip-sync models, enabling comprehensive analysis of multilingual multimodal
deepfake detection. We benchmark our dataset against existing monolingual and
multilingual datasets, state-of-the-art deepfake detection models, and a human

Result: 实验表明，该方法将有效训练轮次降至基线的12.4%，同时准确率提升高达4.82%。

Conclusion: Progressive Data Dropout是一种简单高效的训练范式，无需额外调整即可显著提升训练效率和模型性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training
on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost.
This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size
of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of
models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is
surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and
over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a
series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from
hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can
become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces
the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This
savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the
proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no
changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard
training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

### [459] [RiverMamba: A State Space Model for Global River Discharge and Flood Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22535)
*Mohamad Hakam Shams Eddin,Yikui Zhang,Stefan Kollet,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiverMamba是一种新型深度学习模型，通过预训练和时空建模，提升了全球河流流量和洪水预测的准确性，优于现有AI和物理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在洪水预测中局限于局部应用，未能利用水体的空间连接性，因此需要能够建模时空关系的新方法。

Method: RiverMamba利用高效的Mamba块，结合ECMWF HRES气象预报数据，通过时空建模提升预测能力。

Result: RiverMamba在预测河流流量和极端洪水方面表现优异，超越了现有AI和物理模型。

Conclusion: RiverMamba为科学和业务应用提供了可靠的全球河流流量和洪水预测工具。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for river discharge forecasting have improved
the accuracy and efficiency in flood forecasting, enabling more reliable early
warning systems for risk management. Nevertheless, existing deep learning
approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and
do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus,
there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of
modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood
forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we
present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with
long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and
floods on a $0.05^\circ$ grid up to 7 days lead time, which is of high
relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient
Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture global-scale channel network
routing and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast
blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for
their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates
that RiverMamba delivers reliable predictions of river discharge, including
extreme floods across return periods and lead times, surpassing both
operational AI- and physics-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前协作代理AI解决方案各自独立，导致生态系统碎片化和不兼容，亟需通过互操作性标准实现开放、安全、广泛采用的代理生态系统。

Method: 设计了Web of Agents架构，包含四个组件：代理间消息传递、交互互操作性、状态管理和代理发现，并尽可能采用现有标准和基础设施。

Result: Web of Agents为实现互操作性代理系统提供了关键的第一步，避免了生态系统碎片化成为常态。

Conclusion: 互操作性标准是协作代理AI发展的关键，Web of Agents为未来生态系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Collaborative agentic AI is projected to transform entire industries by
enabling AI-powered agents to autonomously perceive, plan, and act within
digital environments. Yet, current solutions in this field are all built in
isolation, and we are rapidly heading toward a landscape of fragmented,
incompatible ecosystems. In this position paper, we argue that
interoperability, achieved by the adoption of minimal standards, is essential
to ensure open, secure, web-scale, and widely-adopted agentic ecosystems. To
this end, we devise a minimal architectural foundation for collaborative
agentic AI, named Web of Agents, which is composed of four components:
agent-to-agent messaging, interaction interoperability, state management, and
agent discovery. Web of Agents adopts existing standards and reuses existing
infrastructure where possible. With Web of Agents, we take the first but
critical step toward interoperable agentic systems and offer a pragmatic path
forward before ecosystem fragmentation becomes the norm.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，MetaSTNet在小样本情况下能快速适应并实现准确预测。

Conclusion: MetaSTNet为解决小样本网络流量预测问题提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Network traffic prediction techniques have attracted much attention since
they are valuable for network congestion control and user experience
improvement. While existing prediction techniques can achieve favorable
performance when there is sufficient training data, it remains a great
challenge to make accurate predictions when only a small amount of training
data is available. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep learning model,
entitled MetaSTNet, based on a multimodal meta-learning framework. It is an
end-to-end network architecture that trains the model in a simulator and
transfers the meta-knowledge to a real-world environment, which can quickly
adapt and obtain accurate predictions on a new task with only a small amount of
real-world training data. In addition, we further employ cross conformal
prediction to assess the calibrated prediction intervals. Extensive experiments
have been conducted on real-world datasets to illustrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of MetaSTNet.

Abstract: Anomalies are common in network system monitoring. When manifested as network
threats to be mitigated, service outages to be prevented, and security risks to
be ameliorated, detecting such anomalous network behaviors becomes of great
importance. However, the growing scale and complexity of the mobile
communication networks, as well as the ever-increasing amount and
dimensionality of the network surveillance data, make it extremely difficult to
monitor a mobile network and discover abnormal network behaviors. Recent
advances in machine learning allow for obtaining near-optimal solutions to
complicated decision-making problems with many sources of uncertainty that
cannot be accurately characterized by traditional mathematical models. However,
most machine learning algorithms are centralized, which renders them
inapplicable to a large-scale distributed wireless networks with tens of
millions of mobile devices. In this article, we present fog intelligence, a
distributed machine learning architecture that enables intelligent wireless
network management. It preserves the advantage of both edge processing and
centralized cloud computing. In addition, the proposed architecture is
scalable, privacy-preserving, and well suited for intelligent management of a
distributed wireless network.

Conclusion: UI-Evol有效解决知识执行差距，提升代理在计算机任务中的表现和可靠性。

Abstract: External knowledge has played a crucial role in the recent development of
computer use agents. We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved
knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution.
Our analysis shows even 90\% correct knowledge yields only 41\% execution
success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module
for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a
Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual
agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing
knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art
Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts
task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high
behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior
performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化地图动画的创作流程，降低技术门槛，支持快速迭代和创意探索。

Method: 利用代理架构将脚本分解为动画构建块（如相机移动、视觉高亮），结合LLM和网络搜索提取地理信息，并提供交互式时间线编辑器供用户调整。

Result: 通过专家访谈（N=5）和可用性研究（N=12）验证，MapStory能轻松创建地图动画，加快迭代速度并激发创意。

Conclusion: MapStory成功降低了地图故事创作的障碍，提升了创作效率和用户体验。

Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation authoring tool that generates
editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text. Given a
user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to
automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key
animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and
animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately
queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling
the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while
allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to
refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these
blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design
and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators
and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which
includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates
that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates
faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to
creating map-centric stories.

Result: VUI在简单任务中更受用户欢迎，内容质量与图形界面相当；混合界面可能解决认知负载等问题。

Conclusion: 语音界面在特定业务场景中具有潜力，混合界面可能是未来的发展方向。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a solution based on a multi-agent LLM architecture
and a voice user interface (VUI) designed to update the knowledge base of a
digital assistant. Its usability is evaluated in comparison to a more
traditional graphical content management system (CMS), with a focus on
understanding the relationship between user preferences and the complexity of
the information being provided. The findings demonstrate that, while the
overall usability of the VUI is rated lower than the graphical interface, it is
already preferred by users for less complex tasks. Furthermore, the quality of
content entered through the VUI is comparable to that achieved with the
graphical interface, even for highly complex tasks. Obtained qualitative
results suggest that a hybrid interface combining the strengths of both
approaches could address the key challenges identified during the experiment,
such as reducing cognitive load through graphical feedback while maintaining
the intuitive nature of voice-based interactions. This work highlights the
potential of conversational interfaces as a viable and effective method for
knowledge management in specific business contexts.

Motivation: 解决二阶非线性不确定系统在未知外系统下的鲁棒输出调节问题，避免自适应控制方法中的突发现象。

Method: 构建通用内模，通过坐标变换将问题转化为增广系统的非自适应稳定问题，设计控制律和Lyapunov函数。

Result: 提出的非自适应控制律能使增广系统的输出零化流形具有吸引力，解决了鲁棒输出调节问题。

Conclusion: 非自适应内模方法有效，并通过Duffing系统验证了其可行性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robust output regulation problem of second-order
nonlinear uncertain systems with an unknown exosystem. Instead of the adaptive
control approach, this paper resorts to a robust control methodology to solve
the problem and thus avoid the bursting phenomenon. In particular, this paper
constructs generic internal models for the steady-state state and input
variables of the system. By introducing a coordinate transformation, this paper
converts the robust output regulation problem into a nonadaptive stabilization
problem of an augmented system composed of the second-order nonlinear uncertain
system and the generic internal models. Then, we design the stabilization
control law and construct a strict Lyapunov function that guarantees the
robustness with respect to unmodeled disturbances. The analysis shows that the
output zeroing manifold of the augmented system can be made attractive by the
proposed nonadaptive control law, which solves the robust output regulation
problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonadaptive
internal model approach by its application to the control of the Duffing
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs直接应用于稳态HJB方程时可能逼近非最优解，因此需要一种更有效的方法来确保逼近最优值函数。

Method: 将PINNs应用于有限时域变体的HJB方程，该方程具有唯一解，并通过算法验证时域是否足够大。

Result: 仿真验证了理论发现，表明该方法适用于非多项式基函数，且无需先验稳定控制器知识。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了无限时域最优控制问题，避免了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to solve the
infinite-horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. In particular,
since PINNs are generally able to solve a class of partial differential
equations (PDEs), they can be employed to learn the value function of the
infinite-horizon optimal control problem via solving the associated
steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, an issue here is
that the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence
if PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution
that is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle
this by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state
HJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal
value function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen
horizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with
reduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is
not. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with
non-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a
stabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations.
Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.

Abstract: We study the fundamental question of how informative a dataset is for solving
a given decision-making task. In our setting, the dataset provides partial
information about unknown parameters that influence task outcomes. Focusing on
linear programs, we characterize when a dataset is sufficient to recover an
optimal decision, given an uncertainty set on the cost vector. Our main
contribution is a sharp geometric characterization that identifies the
directions of the cost vector that matter for optimality, relative to the task
constraints and uncertainty set. We further develop a practical algorithm that,
for a given task, constructs a minimal or least-costly sufficient dataset. Our
results reveal that small, well-chosen datasets can often fully determine
optimal decisions -- offering a principled foundation for task-aware data
selection.

Result: PolarGrad在多种矩阵优化问题和语言模型预训练任务中表现优于Adam和Muon。

Conclusion: 该框架为矩阵感知优化方法提供了新视角，并展示了PolarGrad的优越性能。

Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the
critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned
gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for
training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware
preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix
structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster
convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing
"matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the
effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new
structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is
its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural
network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that
consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This
perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language
model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated
convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon
this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned
optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued
gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled
by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of
these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms
for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix
optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that
PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.

*Arnulf Jentzen,Julian Kranz,Adrian Riekert*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种并行平均ADAM（PADAM）方法，动态选择优化误差最小的平均变体，无需额外梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均技术（如Ruppert-Polyak和EMA）需针对不同问题调整参数，PADAM旨在动态选择最优平均变体以提升优化效果。

Method: 并行计算ADAM的不同平均变体，训练过程中动态选择误差最小的变体，基于同一梯度轨迹。

Result: 在13个优化和DNN学习问题中，PADAM在多数情况下表现最优，显著降低优化误差。

Conclusion: PADAM适用于科学机器学习问题，并推动DNN训练中自适应平均方法的进一步研究。

Abstract: Averaging techniques such as Ruppert--Polyak averaging and exponential
movering averaging (EMA) are powerful approaches to accelerate optimization
procedures of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods such as
the popular ADAM optimizer. However, depending on the specific optimization
problem under consideration, the type and the parameters for the averaging need
to be adjusted to achieve the smallest optimization error. In this work we
propose an averaging approach, which we refer to as parallel averaged ADAM
(PADAM), in which we compute parallely different averaged variants of ADAM and
during the training process dynamically select the variant with the smallest
optimization error. A central feature of this approach is that this procedure
requires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of
the averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and
thus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in
13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and
compare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as
standard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW. In
particular, we apply the compared optimizers to physics-informed neural
network, deep Galerkin, deep backward stochastic differential equation and deep
Kolmogorov approximations for boundary value partial differential equation
problems from scientific machine learning, as well as to DNN approximations for
optimal control and optimal stopping problems. In nearly all of the considered
examples PADAM achieves, sometimes among others and sometimes exclusively,
essentially the smallest optimization error. This work thus strongly suggest to
consider PADAM for scientific machine learning problems and also motivates
further research for adaptive averaging procedures within the training of DNNs.

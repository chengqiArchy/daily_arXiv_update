### [1] [Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704)
*Feng Yao,Zilong Wang,Liyuan Liu,Junxia Cui,Li Zhong,Xiaohan Fu,Haohui Mai,Vish Krishnan,Jianfeng Gao,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REAL是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过程序分析和单元测试反馈，激励大型语言模型生成高质量的代码，解决了现有方法在可扩展性和有效性上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调和基于规则的后处理）依赖人工标注或脆弱的启发式方法，难以确保代码质量（如安全性和可维护性），且缺乏可扩展性。

Method: REAL结合程序分析（检测缺陷）和单元测试（确保功能正确性），无需人工干预，提供自动反馈以优化模型生成的代码。

Result: 实验表明，REAL在功能性和代码质量评估上优于现有方法，适用于多种数据集和模型规模。

Conclusion: REAL填补了快速原型设计与生产级代码之间的鸿沟，使大型语言模型在速度和代码质量上均表现出色。

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding,
is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality,
particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and
maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive
annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that
incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program
analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales
demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous
assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between
rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both
speed and quality.

### [2] [Climate Finance Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22752)
*Rafik Mankour,Yassine Chafai,Hamada Saleh,Ghassen Ben Hassine,Thibaud Barreau,Peter Tankov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Climate Finance Bench是一个针对企业气候披露的问答开放基准，使用大型语言模型，包含33份报告和330个专家验证的问题-答案对，比较了RAG方法，发现检索能力是性能瓶颈，并提倡透明碳报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为企业气候披露的问答任务提供一个开放基准，推动大型语言模型在气候金融领域的应用。

Method: 收集33份可持续发展报告，标注330个问题-答案对，比较RAG方法，分析检索能力的影响。

Result: 检索能力是RAG方法性能的主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 提倡在气候AI应用中透明报告碳排放，并推荐权重量化等技术。

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets
question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language
Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from
companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated
question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and
logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's
ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief
performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in
AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as
Weight Quantization.

### [3] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)
*Ansar Aynetdinov,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对小语言模型（SLMs）的多令牌预测（MTP）训练策略，通过课程学习（前向和反向两种变体）提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在多令牌预测任务中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，包括前向课程（从NTP逐步过渡到MTP）和反向课程（从MTP逐步过渡到NTP）。

Result: 前向课程提升了SLMs的MTP性能，同时保留了自推测解码的优势；反向课程虽提升了NTP性能，但失去了自推测解码的益处。

Conclusion: 前向课程更适合SLMs，能在提升性能的同时保留MTP的优势。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

### [4] [FAMA: The First Large-Scale Open-Science Speech Foundation Model for English and Italian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22759)
*Sara Papi,Marco Gaido,Luisa Bentivogli,Alessio Brutti,Mauro Cettolo,Roberto Gretter,Marco Matassoni,Mohamed Nabih,Matteo Negri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAMA是首个基于开源数据的语音基础模型家族，填补了语音领域开放科学的空白，性能与现有模型相当且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基础模型（如Whisper和SeamlessM4T）的封闭性导致可复现性和公平评估的挑战，而其他领域已通过开源模型取得进展。

Method: 开发FAMA家族模型，使用超过150k小时的开源语音数据，并提供一个包含16k小时清理和伪标注语音的新数据集。

Result: FAMA在性能上与现有模型竞争，且速度提升高达8倍。

Conclusion: FAMA及其所有相关资源（代码、数据集和模型）均以开源许可证发布，推动了语音技术研究的开放性。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under
OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

### [5] [StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22765)
*Iddo Yosha,Gallil Maimon,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了StressTest基准测试，评估语音感知语言模型（SLM）在句子重音区分任务中的表现，并通过合成数据集Stress17k优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子重音在语音中起关键作用，但现有SLM模型在评估和开发中忽视了这一点。

Method: 引入StressTest基准测试，评估SLM模型；提出合成数据生成方法创建Stress17k训练集；优化模型StresSLM。

Result: 现有SLM在重音任务上表现不佳；StresSLM在句子重音推理和检测任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据优化SLM模型能有效提升其在句子重音任务中的表现。

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

### [6] [Automated Essay Scoring Incorporating Annotations from Automated Feedback Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22771)
*Christopher Ormerod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将反馈导向的注释纳入自动作文评分（AES）流程，可以提高评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过引入拼写、语法错误和论证成分的反馈注释，提升AES系统的性能。

Method: 使用PERSUADE语料库，结合生成式语言模型和编码器基础的标记分类器，生成拼写修正和论证成分注释。

Result: 通过将注释整合到评分过程中，基于编码器的大型语言模型在分类任务中表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动的注释能够有效提升AES系统的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into
the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES).
This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting,
and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We
integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify
spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative
components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world
scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language
model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

### [7] [Counting trees: A treebank-driven exploration of syntactic variation in speech and writing across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22774)
*Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于树库的方法，通过依赖解析语料库比较口语和书面语的句法结构。研究发现口语语料库的句法结构更少且多样性更低，且口语和书面语的句法结构重叠有限，反映了两种模态的独特需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于系统比较口语和书面语的句法结构差异，以理解实时互动和书面表达的句法组织特点。

Method: 采用自下而上的归纳方法，从英语和斯洛文尼亚语的通用依赖树库中提取去词汇化的依赖子树，分析其规模、多样性和分布。

Result: 结果显示口语语料库的句法结构更少且多样性更低，且两种模态的句法结构重叠有限，反映了交互性和表达经济性的特点。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语料库句法变异研究提供了可扩展的语言无关方法，为基于数据的语法理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

### [8] [MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777)
*John Mendonça,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDAL是一个自动化多智能体框架，用于生成、评估和筛选更具代表性和多样性的开放域对话评估基准，解决了现有基准数据集静态、过时和缺乏多语言覆盖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天机器人及其底层LLM能力的显著提升，评估其性能成为进一步发展的主要障碍。现有基准数据集多为静态、过时且缺乏多语言覆盖，难以捕捉细微的语言和文化差异。

Method: MEDAL利用多个先进的LLM生成多语言用户-聊天机器人对话，基于多样化的种子上下文。随后使用GPT-4.1进行多维性能分析，并通过大规模评估筛选出新的多语言元评估基准，辅以人工标注的细粒度质量判断。

Result: 研究发现，当前LLM在检测细微问题（如同理心和推理）方面表现不佳，且存在显著的跨语言性能差异。

Conclusion: MEDAL框架为开放域对话评估提供了更全面和动态的基准，揭示了LLM在评估任务中的局限性，尤其是在处理复杂语言和文化差异时。

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

### [9] [Can Large Language Models Match the Conclusions of Systematic Reviews?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22787)
*Christopher Polzak,Alejandro Lozano,Min Woo Sun,James Burgess,Yuhui Zhang,Kevin Wu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能与临床专家撰写的系统性综述（SRs）结论相匹配，发现当前LLMs在证据评估和多文档推理方面仍存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学文献的快速增长，利用LLMs自动化生成SRs的需求增加，但其能力尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 研究提出了MedEvidence基准，包含100个SRs及其相关研究，评估了24种LLMs的性能。

Result: 研究发现，推理能力不一定会提升性能，模型大小与表现无直接关联，且知识微调会降低准确性。LLMs普遍表现出对低质量证据缺乏科学怀疑。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs尚无法可靠匹配专家撰写的SRs结论，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

### [10] [Towards a More Generalized Approach in Open Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22801)
*Qing Wang,Yuepei Li,Qiao Qiao,Kang Zhou,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixORE是一个两阶段框架，用于在未标记数据中同时学习已知和新型关系，通过关系分类和聚类实现，实验证明其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中新型关系是随机分布的，传统OpenRE方法无法处理已知和新型关系的混合数据。

Method: 提出MixORE框架，结合关系分类和聚类，分两阶段处理已知和新型关系。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MixORE在已知关系分类和新型关系聚类上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MixORE推动了广义OpenRE研究和实际应用的进展。

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

### [11] [First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons & Dragons Gameplay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809)
*Andrew Zhu,Evan Osgood,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的LLM代理范式——"偷听代理"，它通过监听人类对话而非直接参与来提供背景任务支持或建议。研究以《龙与地下城》游戏为背景，评估了大型多模态音频-语言模型作为偷听代理的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM代理的另一种交互方式，即通过监听人类对话提供帮助，而非直接参与对话。

Method: 使用大型多模态音频-语言模型作为偷听代理，在《龙与地下城》游戏中辅助地下城主，并通过人类评估检验其有效性。

Result: 研究发现某些大型音频-语言模型具备通过隐式音频线索完成偷听代理任务的能力。

Conclusion: 偷听代理是一种有潜力的LLM代理范式，研究提供了相关代码库以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist
human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with
LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not
actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on
human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have
the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio
cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support
further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at
https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

### [12] [Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22823)
*Yingming Wang,Pepa Atanasova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SR-NLE框架，通过自我批判和迭代优化提升大语言模型生成的自然语言解释的忠实度，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型生成的自然语言解释往往无法忠实反映模型的真实推理过程，缺乏自我优化的探索。

Method: 引入SR-NLE框架，结合自然语言自我反馈和基于特征归因的新反馈机制，迭代优化解释的忠实度。

Result: 实验表明SR-NLE显著降低不忠实率，最佳方法平均不忠实率为36.02%，比基线降低18.79%。

Conclusion: 研究表明大语言模型可通过适当反馈机制优化解释忠实度，无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

*Alexander Gill,Abhilasha Ravichander,Ana Marasović*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，虽然LLMs能以低成本生成有效的评测数据，但其生成的数据对LLMs本身的挑战性低于人工标注数据，呼吁重新评估LLMs生成评测数据的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs能否满足生成高质量评测数据的需求，尤其是针对特定现象和避免利用捷径的情况。

Method: 通过两个案例研究（CondaQA和DROP），比较LLMs生成的数据与人工标注数据的有效性和难度。

Result: LLMs生成的数据在有效性上接近人工标注数据，但对LLMs的挑战性较低。

Conclusion: LLMs生成评测数据虽然成本低，但可能牺牲挑战性，需谨慎评估其适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

*Arthur S. Bianchessi,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BAM的理论框架，将位置编码视为概率模型中的先验，统一了现有方法并显著提升了长上下文泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法缺乏理论清晰性，且评估指标有限，无法充分支持其外推能力。

Method: 提出贝叶斯注意力机制（BAM），将位置编码建模为先验，并推导出广义高斯位置先验。

Result: BAM在500倍训练上下文长度下仍能准确检索信息，优于现有方法，同时保持较低的困惑度和额外参数。

Conclusion: BAM为位置编码提供了理论支持，显著提升了长上下文泛化能力，且具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

Motivation: NLI中存在人类标注者标签一致但推理不同的现象（within-label variation），现有研究多忽略此问题。通过分析自由文本解释，揭示标注者推理的多样性。

Method: 提出LITEX分类法，标注e-SNLI数据集子集，验证分类法可靠性，并分析其与标签、高亮和解释的关联。评估分类法在解释生成中的应用。

Result: LITEX分类法能有效捕捉within-label variation，且基于LITEX生成的解释更接近人类解释。

Conclusion: LITEX分类法不仅能揭示标注者推理差异，还能提升模型生成解释的质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

### [16] [GateNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 10: Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting for Multilingual Narrative Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22867)
*Iknoor Singh,Carolina Scarton,Kalina Bontcheva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为H3Prompt的分层三步提示方法，用于多语言新闻叙事分类，并在SemEval 2025任务中取得最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻的激增和错误信息的传播需要自动数据分析方法，叙事分类成为重要任务，对事实核查和政策制定者至关重要。

Method: 采用三步大型语言模型（LLM）提示策略：先分类文章到两个领域之一，再识别主要叙事，最后分配子叙事。

Result: 在28个全球团队中，该方法在英语测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: H3Prompt方法在多语言叙事分类中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation
necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative
classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being
said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other
professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach
to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a
pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across
multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual
narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language
Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article
into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies
the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our
approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing
teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

### [17] [When Models Reason in Your Language: Controlling Thinking Trace Language Comes at the Cost of Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22888)
*Jirui Qi,Shan Chen,Zidi Xiong,Raquel Fernández,Danielle S. Bitterman,Arianna Bisazza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在英语推理任务中表现优异，但在其他语言中的推理能力研究较少。研究发现，即使最先进的模型在多语言推理时仍倾向于使用英语或产生碎片化推理，存在明显差距。通过提示干预或少量针对性训练可改善可读性，但会牺牲部分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于评估LRMs在多语言推理中的表现，因为用户需要以母语理解推理过程以实现有效监督。

Method: 方法包括在XReasoning基准上全面评估两种主流LRMs家族，并通过提示干预和少量针对性训练（100个示例）改善模型表现。

Result: 结果显示，当前LRMs在多语言推理中存在显著不足，提示干预可提升可读性但降低准确性，而少量训练能部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，需进一步研究以平衡可读性与准确性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了VIGNETTE，一个大规模VQA基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的偏见，涵盖事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）的偏见研究较多，但视觉语言模型（VLMs）的偏见研究较少，且现有研究多局限于肖像图像和性别-职业关联，忽略了更广泛的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害。

Method: 通过VIGNETTE基准，使用3000万+图像和问答框架，评估VLMs在四种方向上的偏见表现，并结合社会心理学分析模型如何从视觉线索推断特质和社会角色。

Result: 研究发现VLMs存在微妙、多面且令人惊讶的刻板印象模式，揭示了模型如何从输入中构建社会意义并编码社会等级。

Conclusion: VIGNETTE为VLMs的偏见研究提供了更全面的视角，揭示了模型在复杂社会情境中的偏见表现及其潜在危害。

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解人类和LLM如何归因事件结果，尤其是基于人口统计学的归因，及其对公平性的影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于认知的偏见评估框架，用于识别LLM在推理过程中如何将偏见导向特定人口群体。

Result: 研究发现LLM在归因事件结果时存在基于人口统计学的偏见，这可能导致不公平的决策。

Conclusion: 结论强调了需要开发更公平的模型，以减少基于人口统计学的偏见，并提出了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's
difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes,
shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions.
Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign
responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to
internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多依赖昂贵的人工标注且未能全面反映临床推理流程，急诊室作为高风险场景需要更真实的评估工具。

Method: ER-Reason整合了25,174份临床记录，设计了涵盖急诊工作流关键阶段的任务，并收集了72份医生推理过程。

Result: 评估显示当前大型语言模型与医生临床推理存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 未来研究需弥补模型与医生推理的差距，提升急诊决策支持能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长期依赖时存在上下文丢失和语义漂移问题，研究旨在通过改进记忆机制来提升模型性能。

Method: 模型集成了显式记忆单元、门控写入和注意力读取模块，并引入遗忘函数动态更新记忆内容，同时设计了联合训练目标以优化记忆策略。

Result: 模型在文本生成一致性、多轮问答稳定性和跨上下文推理准确性方面表现优异，尤其在长文本任务和复杂问答场景中展现了强语义保留和上下文连贯性。

Conclusion: 研究证实了记忆机制在语言理解中的关键作用，提出的方法在架构设计和性能表现上均具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSRM的方法，用于解决低秩适应（LoRA）模型合并时的性能下降问题，通过正交子空间约束提升多任务模型的合并效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在LoRA微调模型上表现不佳，导致性能显著下降，需要一种新方法来减少任务间的干扰。

Method: 提出OSRM方法，在微调前约束LoRA子空间，确保任务更新不影响其他任务的输出，并与现有合并算法兼容。

Result: 在八个数据集上的实验表明，OSRM不仅提升了合并性能，还保持了单任务准确性，且对合并超参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: OSRM强调了数据与参数交互在模型合并中的重要性，为LoRA模型合并提供了一种即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

Result: 模型验证F1分数为0.6536，推理时间为0.1208秒/问题，优于基于规则的基线（F1:0.3124）和完整BERT模型。

Conclusion: 该模型在准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡，适合资源受限系统的实时应用，并提供了优化CPU推理的实用见解。

Abstract: This study presents an efficient transformer-based question-answering (QA)
model optimized for deployment on a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U CPU, using the
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1. Leveraging exploratory data
analysis, data augmentation, and fine-tuning of a DistilBERT architecture, the
model achieves a validation F1 score of 0.6536 with an average inference time
of 0.1208 seconds per question. Compared to a rule-based baseline (F1: 0.3124)
and full BERT-based models, our approach offers a favorable trade-off between
accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes it well-suited for real-time
applications on resource-constrained systems. The study includes systematic
evaluation of data augmentation strategies and hyperparameter configurations,
providing practical insights into optimizing transformer models for CPU-based
inference.

Motivation: 现有基于监督微调的网页代理在动态网页交互中泛化性和鲁棒性不足，缺乏推理能力。

Method: 采用规则化R1强化学习框架，通过结构化奖励函数评估输出格式和动作正确性，隐式学习中间推理。

Result: 在WorkArena基准测试中，WorkForceAgent-R1比SFT基线提升10.26-16.59%，性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WorkForceAgent-R1通过强化学习显著提升网页导航任务的性能，适用于企业环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex,
real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing
web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with
generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when
handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we
introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based
R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly
learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive
expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by
10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary
LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Motivation: 预训练多模态表示（如CLIP）虽然表现出色，但存在组合漏洞，导致反直觉的判断。论文旨在揭示并改进这些漏洞。

Method: 通过MAC基准生成欺骗性文本，评估多模态表示的漏洞；提出自训练方法，结合拒绝采样微调和多样性过滤。

Result: 使用较小语言模型（如Llama-3.1-8B）的方法在多模态表示（图像、视频、音频）中表现出色，成功揭示了组合漏洞。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效提升了攻击成功率和样本多样性，为多模态表示的组合漏洞研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在多语言和跨语言环境下的记忆能力，尤其是对非英语语言的泛化能力。

Method: 使用OWL数据集（包含10种语言的31.5K对齐文本），通过直接探测、名称填空和前缀生成三种任务评估模型记忆能力。

Result: LLMs能跨语言回忆内容，例如GPT-4o在新翻译文本中识别作者和标题的准确率为69%，扰动（如打乱单词）对准确率影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的跨语言记忆能力，并提供了模型间差异的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs在否定理解上的能力，因为否定是语言中的基本现象，可能影响高风险应用中的模型表现。

Method: 利用大型语言模型从现有VQA数据集中生成否定问题，构建NegVQA基准，并评估20个先进VLMs的表现。

Result: VLMs在否定问题上表现显著下降，模型规模对性能的影响呈U型趋势。

Conclusion: NegVQA揭示了VLMs在否定理解上的关键不足，为未来模型开发提供了方向。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

TL;DR: StrucSum是一种无需训练的提示框架，通过句子级图结构增强LLM的推理能力，显著提升零样本摘要的质量和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本摘要中表现良好，但在长文本中建模文档结构和识别关键信息方面存在困难。

Method: StrucSum通过三种策略注入结构信号：邻居感知提示（NAP）用于局部上下文，中心性感知提示（CAP）用于重要性估计，以及中心性引导掩码（CGM）用于高效输入缩减。

Result: 在ArXiv、PubMed和Multi-News上的实验表明，StrucSum在摘要质量和事实一致性上均优于无监督基线和普通提示方法，尤其在ArXiv上FactCC和SummaC分别提升了19.2和9.7分。

Conclusion: 结构感知提示是一种简单有效的零样本抽取式摘要方法，无需训练或任务特定调整。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot
summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify
salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training
or task-specific tuning.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM在挖掘在线评论中特定主题的预定义论点方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 方法包括在六个争议性主题的2000多条评论数据集上，对四种LLM进行定量评估和详细错误分析。

Result: 结果显示LLM在三个任务中表现优异，尤其是大型和精细调整的模型，但对长文本和情感化语言的处理存在不足。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM在自动化论点分析中具有潜力，但仍需解决长文本和情感化语言的挑战。

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues
like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks,
their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online
comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three
argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments
across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall
strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned
LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error
analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and
emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like
content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise
and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online
comments.

TL;DR: HSE-Bench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在HSE合规性评估中能力的首个基准数据集，包含1000多个问题，并采用IRAC推理流程。研究发现当前LLM依赖语义匹配而非原则性推理，提出新的提示技术RoE以改进推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSE合规性评估需要动态实时决策，但LLM在领域知识和结构化法律推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建HSE-Bench数据集，采用IRAC推理流程评估LLM，并提出RoE提示技术模拟专家推理。

Result: 当前LLM表现良好但依赖语义匹配，推理缺乏系统性。RoE技术能提升推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在HSE合规性推理中的不足，RoE技术为改进提供了方向，并呼吁进一步研究。

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

TL;DR: ToMAP是一种通过整合两个心智理论模块来增强说服者代理灵活性的新方法，显著提升了说服效果和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在心智理论推理上表现不足，导致说服策略缺乏多样性和对手意识。

Method: ToMAP通过预测对手立场并结合强化学习生成更有效的论点。

Result: ToMAP在3B参数下表现优于更大模型（如GPT-4o），相对增益达39.4%。

Conclusion: ToMAP展示了开发更具说服力语言代理的潜力，适用于长对话和逻辑策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,
but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,
while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind
(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To
address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索电子健康记录（EHR）这一丰富但结构不同于自然语言的数据源是否也存在类似LLM的扩展规律。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库中的患者时间线数据，训练不同规模和计算预算的Transformer架构，分析扩展规律。

Result: 发现EHR模型存在与LLM类似的扩展行为，包括抛物线IsoFLOPs曲线和计算、模型参数、数据量与临床效用之间的幂律关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发高效的EHR基础模型奠定了基础，有望推动临床预测任务和个性化医疗的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized
healthcare.

TL;DR: VeGraph是一个基于LLM的框架，通过图表示、实体消歧和验证三阶段解决复杂声明的验证问题，实验表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复杂声明验证中因实体消歧不足而受限，VeGraph旨在利用LLM的推理能力提升验证准确性和可解释性。

Method: VeGraph分三阶段：图表示（将声明分解为三元组）、实体消歧（与知识库交互解决模糊实体）、验证（完成事实核查）。

Result: 使用Meta-Llama-3-70B在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准测试中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: VeGraph通过结合LLM和图表示，有效解决了复杂声明验证的挑战，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

TL;DR: DyePack是一个通过后门攻击检测模型是否在训练中使用基准测试集的框架，无需访问模型内部细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放基准测试容易被污染，需要一种透明且可复现的方法来检测模型是否使用了测试集。

Method: DyePack通过混合后门样本到测试数据中，利用随机目标的多后门设计，精确计算误报率。

Result: 在多项选择任务中，误报率低至0.000073%（MMLU-Pro）和0.000017%（Big-Bench-Hard）；在开放生成任务中，误报率为0.127%（Alpaca）。

Conclusion: DyePack能有效检测测试集污染，保证低误报率，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific
constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the
probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于参考过滤和TF-IDF聚类（RFTC）的隐蔽后门样本检测方法，用于解决LLMs中隐蔽中毒样本的高效消除问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流检测方法在生成任务中不适用或可能降低性能，因此需要一种高效的方法来消除隐蔽中毒样本。

Method: 通过参考模型输出与样本响应的比较筛选可疑样本，再对可疑样本进行TF-IDF聚类，根据类内距离识别真正的中毒样本。

Result: 在两个机器翻译数据集和一个QA数据集上的实验表明，RFTC在后门检测和模型性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFTC方法有效解决了隐蔽后门样本的检测问题，且参考过滤机制被证明是有效的。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KE评估通常忽略上下文对知识编辑的影响，而实际应用中上下文可能触发原始知识，削弱编辑效果。

Method: 开发了CHED基准评估KE方法的上下文稳健性，并提出了CoRE方法，通过减少隐藏状态中的上下文敏感方差来增强稳健性。

Result: 评估显示现有KE方法在上下文存在时表现不佳，而CoRE方法显著提高了编辑成功率并保持了模型能力。

Conclusion: CoRE方法有效提升了KE的上下文稳健性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

Motivation: 图像性和具体性是连接视觉和语义空间的心理语言学特性，现有方法依赖多模态数据。本文假设仅文本数据即可准确估计这些特性。

Method: 提出NSM方法，量化语义嵌入空间中单词邻域的峰值度，以反映图像性和具体性。

Result: NSM与真实评分的相关性优于现有无监督方法，且在分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 文本数据本身足以估计图像性和具体性，NSM是一种有效的无监督方法。

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub
(https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

Motivation: 通用临床NLP工具在儿科胸部X光报告标注中的独立评估有限，因此本研究旨在比较不同工具的性能。

Method: 分析了95,008份儿科胸部X光报告，使用四种商业NLP系统和两种专用工具进行实体提取和断言检测，并通过Fleiss Kappa和准确性评估性能。

Result: 不同工具提取的实体数量和断言准确性差异显著，SparkNLP表现最佳（76%），Amazon Comprehend Medical最低（50%），专用工具准确率为56%。

Conclusion: 临床NLP工具性能差异显著，部署前需严格验证。

Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are
increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However,
independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph
(CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial
clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP
(GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and
assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss
Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant
differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion
distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC
16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged
around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert
achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the
need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical
report labeling.

Conclusion: 结论指出MFE的发展凸显了交流效率与语言丰富性之间的张力，并提出了对话界面设计和多语言用户教学方面的挑战。

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于ICL的NER方法依赖大参数LLM，存在计算资源消耗高、API成本高、数据隐私问题和社区协作障碍。EL4NER旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EL4NER包含三个关键组件：任务分解管道、基于句子相似度的ICL演示检索机制和自验证机制。

Result: 实验表明，EL4NER在多个NER数据集上优于大多数闭源大参数LLM方法，并在某些数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EL4NER展示了在小参数LLM上实现高效ICL的可行性，为NER任务提供了一种低成本高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on
certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and
underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs
within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

Motivation: 现有路由方法依赖静态知识表示，无法适应RAG中动态文档对LLM能力的影响，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RAGRouter，利用文档嵌入和RAG能力嵌入，通过对比学习捕捉知识表示变化，实现智能路由。

Result: 在多样化知识密集型任务中，RAGRouter平均优于最佳单LLM 3.61%，优于现有路由方法3.29%-9.33%。

Conclusion: RAGRouter通过动态路由机制，显著提升了RAG场景下的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

Conclusion: CoCoS有效提升了小型语言模型的自我修正能力，为代码生成领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: SNS-Bench-VL是一个多模态基准测试，用于评估视觉-语言大模型在社交媒体场景中的表现，包含8个任务和4001个问题-答案对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体中视觉和文本内容的融合，评估大模型的多模态能力对提升用户体验和平台智能至关重要。现有基准测试主要关注文本任务，缺乏对多模态场景的覆盖。

Method: 提出了SNS-Bench-VL基准测试，包含8个多模态任务（如笔记理解、用户参与分析等），并评估了25个先进的多模态大模型。

Result: 研究发现多模态社交语境理解仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: SNS-Bench-VL旨在推动未来研究，开发更鲁棒、上下文感知且符合人类需求的多模态智能。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social
Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content
understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in
modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a
comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of
Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL
incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note
comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and
personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal
question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended
tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their
performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in
multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire
future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal
intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

*Yuu Jinnai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码应用于文档级文本生成任务，并提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的变体MBR-OT，以解决传统MBR在文档级任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级文本生成任务比句子级任务更具挑战性，因为需要理解更长的上下文。传统MBR解码在句子级任务中表现良好，但在文档级任务中效果有限，因为其效用函数通常针对句子设计。

Method: 提出了MBR-OT，利用Wasserstein距离和句子级效用函数计算文档的效用，从而改进MBR解码在文档级任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中优于标准MBR。

Conclusion: MBR-OT通过引入Wasserstein距离，有效提升了MBR解码在文档级文本生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our

*Zexuan Li,Hongliang Dai,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何通过大语言模型（LLM）生成多样且正确的关系抽取（RE）训练数据，提出两种方法：基于上下文学习的提示优化和基于直接偏好优化的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLM生成的关系抽取训练数据存在结构相似性高、表达单一的问题，影响模型性能。

Method: 1. 通过上下文学习（ICL）提示优化生成多样样本；2. 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）微调LLM以提高多样性。

Result: 实验表明两种方法均能提升生成数据的质量，且用生成数据训练的非LLM模型性能优于直接使用LLM。

Conclusion: 优化LLM生成数据的多样性和正确性可有效提升关系抽取任务性能，非LLM模型训练更具优势。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

<details>

Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，限制了大型语言模型（LLM）与人类价值观对齐的可扩展性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o作为LLM对齐的代理，计算LLM生成响应的对齐分数，并基于均值和方差构建Alignment Data Map。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用33%的高均值、低方差区域数据，性能与全数据集相当或更好。

Conclusion: Alignment Data Map能显著提升数据收集效率，并诊断现有偏好数据集中的低质量样本。

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

Conclusion: MedE²是一种有效且可靠的方法，适用于增强医学多模态模型的推理能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

Result: ContextQFormer在TMDialog数据集上的可用率比基线模型提高了2%-4%。

Conclusion: ContextQFormer和TMDialog数据集为多轮多模态对话研究提供了有效工具，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Motivation: 研究LCoT LLMs在实用问题中的泛化能力，尤其是历史语言学启发的归纳推理问题，填补了现有研究在数学、编码等领域的空白。

Method: 开发了一个自动化流水线，动态生成可控难度的基准测试，解决了现有推理基准的可扩展性和污染问题。

Result: 生成的测试集包含近1k个实例，对当前最先进的推理LLMs具有挑战性，最佳模型（Claude-3.7-Sonnet）仅达到54%的通过率。

Conclusion: LCoT LLMs在历史语言学等领域的推理能力仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have
taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning
capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models
general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which
has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a
historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as
Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the
best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating
that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in
historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单有效的方法，通过获取上下文敏感单元（CSUs）并应用语义焦点，增强大语言模型（LLMs）的机器翻译能力，无需额外训练即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在翻译上下文敏感单元（如多义词）时的挑战，这些挑战不仅影响翻译准确性，还可能导致翻译失败。

Method: 动态分析并识别翻译难点，以结构化方式将其融入LLMs，避免信息扁平化导致的误译或误解。

Result: 在基准数据集上，该方法与多个开源基线模型相比表现优异，适用于多种语言对。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，资源消耗低，能有效提升LLMs在多种NLP任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Motivation: 传统双语词典归纳方法在专业领域表现不佳，因为专业领域数据规模小且词频低，静态词嵌入无法充分捕捉上下文语义。

Method: 结合预训练模型改进词嵌入质量，并引入Code Switch技术以适应跨领域双语词典归纳任务。

Result: 在三个特定领域上，该方法比基线方法平均提升了0.78分。

Conclusion: 该方法在专业领域双语词典归纳任务中表现更优，但仍需进一步验证其适用性。

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to
obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word
embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the
word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is
to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to
extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of
Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that
build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et
al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is
yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon
extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and
efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical
dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set
is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different
contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results
show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on
three specific domains by averagely improving 0.78 points.

Motivation: 传统主题建模方法（如LDA）在文学文本中表现不佳，因为文学语言注重感官细节而非抽象描述。

Method: 使用生成式语言模型将叙事内容转化为高层次概念，再结合LDA进行主题建模。

Result: Retell方法比单独使用LDA或直接让语言模型列出主题更精确且信息丰富。

Conclusion: Retell方法在文化分析中具有潜力，能够更准确地捕捉文学中的主题和概念。

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high
school English language arts books.

languages and sociophonetic variation. With the large-scale training data,
ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage
the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition
systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training
on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement.
While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals

Result: 在Rotowire和Livesum数据集上，该方法显著提升了性能，并提供了更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: Map&Make框架在结构化摘要任务中表现出色，并通过详细分析验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.
We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered
versions and filtered versions via static analysis. The data are available at

Result: 在12种翻译方向的14个指标评估中，发现无监督指标的潜力、监督方法在标签不确定性下的不足，以及单一标注评估的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 无监督指标潜力大，监督方法受标签不确定性影响，单一标注评估不可靠。

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify
fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses,
including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are
often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc
training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate
efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model
interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors
from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14
metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label
variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our
results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the
shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the
brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and
inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in
isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization
across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量人工或时间成本来为每个任务收集经验，这在任务类型多样化的情况下不切实际。

Method: 设计了一个自主经验转移框架，让LLMs能够模仿人类认知智能，自主地从源任务转移经验到目标任务。

Result: 在13个数据集上的实验表明，该框架有效提升了LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅降低了经验获取的成本，还为LLMs的泛化提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving
experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods
rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each
task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user
queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience
transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive
intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to
newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets
demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

Conclusion: MMBoundary通过推理步骤置信度校准，有效提升MLLMs的推理能力和任务表现。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

Motivation: 传统MCTS方法在开放对话中因缺乏明确正确性标准而易产生偏差，需改进以符合主观需求（如共情、伦理）。

Method: 提出MCTSr-Zero框架，引入“领域对齐”调整搜索目标，并采用“再生”和“元提示适应”机制扩展探索空间。

Result: 实验表明，基于MCTSr-Zero生成的对话数据训练的PsyLLM在PsyEval基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero有效解决了开放对话中LLM的领域对齐问题，为心理咨询等任务提供了高质量数据生成方法。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

Result: 在ChartMind和三个公共基准上的评估显示，ChartLLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更鲁棒的图表推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成类人文本方面表现出色，但对信息完整性构成挑战，尤其是在阿拉伯语等低资源语言中。

Method: 研究采用多种生成策略（如标题生成、内容感知生成和文本优化）和模型架构（ALLaM、Jais、Llama、GPT-4），结合风格计量分析，开发BERT检测模型。

Result: 研究发现机器生成的阿拉伯语文本具有可检测的特征，BERT模型在正式语境中表现优异（F1-score达99.9%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为阿拉伯语机器生成文本检测提供了全面基础，强调了跨领域检测的挑战，并为信息完整性保护提供了支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sentinel是一种轻量级句子级压缩框架，通过利用现成的小型代理LLM的解码器注意力信号，实现高效、问题感知的上下文压缩，无需训练专用压缩模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法中，检索到的段落通常冗长、噪声多或超出输入限制，而传统压缩方法需要训练专用模型，成本高且可移植性差。

Method: Sentinel通过轻量级分类器探测0.5B代理LLM的解码器注意力信号，识别句子相关性，实现上下文过滤。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，Sentinel实现高达5倍的压缩，同时匹配7B规模压缩系统的问答性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用原生注意力信号可以实现快速、有效且问题感知的上下文压缩。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

Motivation: 当前知识编辑任务过于简单，缺乏对实际应用场景的评估，因此需要更全面的基准测试。

Method: 提出ScEdit基准，结合反事实和时间编辑，整合标记级和文本级评估方法。

Result: 现有知识编辑方法在性能上均有所下降，尤其在文本级指标上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ScEdit揭示了知识编辑在实际应用中的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

Motivation: 探讨LLMs生成文本长度对事实准确性的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出一种自动化的双层长文本事实性评估框架，并通过控制实验验证长度偏差的存在。

Result: 长文本的事实精度更低，主要原因是知识逐渐耗尽（facts exhaustion），而非错误传播或长上下文。

Conclusion: 知识耗尽是导致长文本事实性下降的主要原因，为LLMs的优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: While Ukrainian NLP has seen progress in many texts processing tasks, emotion

dataset for emotion detection in Ukrainian texts. Our annotation schema is
adapted from the previous English-centric works on emotion detection (Mohammad
et al., 2018; Mohammad, 2022) guidelines. The dataset was created through
crowdsourcing using the Toloka.ai platform ensuring high-quality of the
annotation process. Then, we evaluate a range of approaches on the collected
dataset, starting from linguistic-based baselines, synthetic data translated
from English, to large language models (LLMs). Our findings highlight the
challenges of emotion classification in non-mainstream languages like Ukrainian
and emphasize the need for further development of Ukrainian-specific models and
training resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 当前文本GCD方法在现实场景中验证不足，尤其是面对长文本、复杂叙事和高度不平衡的类别分布时，存在聚类与分类不一致以及少数类别对齐不公平的挑战。

Method: 提出PaMA框架，利用大语言模型提取和优化事件模式，并通过排名-过滤-挖掘流程确保不平衡类别中原型的平衡表示。

Result: 在两个EC-GCD基准测试（包括新构建的Scam Report数据集）上，PaMA比现有方法性能提升高达12.58% H-score，同时在基础GCD数据集上保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PaMA框架有效解决了EC-GCD中的关键挑战，显著提升了性能，并为现实场景中的类别发现提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel
categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes.
Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD
datasets.

Method: 将置信度估计作为分类任务，利用分数分箱和新的KWOCCE损失函数，结合CEFR标签的序数结构。

Result: 最佳模型F1分数为0.97，47%的评分达到100% CEFR一致性，99%的评分至少达到95%一致性，显著优于独立AES模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了AES评分的可靠性，为评分发布提供了更严格的置信度标准。

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

Motivation: 直接对齐方法虽然能有效引导模型匹配相对偏好，但会降低示例响应的绝对似然，导致模型输出偏离预期模式，甚至在没有奖励模型的情况下出现奖励黑客效应。

Method: 论文重新审视了直接偏好优化（DPO）的损失函数，提出了一种分解重构的损失形式，并基于此开发了PRO方法，通过近似完整的正则化项解决似然不确定性问题。

Result: 实验表明，PRO在涉及成对、二元和标量反馈的场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRO通过解决似然不确定性问题，为直接对齐方法提供了更广泛的应用范围和更高的性能。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Result: LLM的推理能力是可预测、可控的，不涉及人类高级认知能力，且无法通过无限训练扩展。

Conclusion: 研究应聚焦于上下文指导的外推机制及其与训练数据的交互，探索不依赖高级推理的增强技术。

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: Q-RM是一种通过解耦奖励建模与语言生成来优化判别策略的令牌级奖励模型，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成语言建模与奖励建模之间的冲突导致的信用分配不准确问题。

Method: 提出Q-RM，通过优化判别策略（Q函数）从偏好数据中学习令牌级奖励，无需细粒度标注。

Result: Q-RM在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法，显著提升数学推理任务的Pass@1分数和训练效率。

Conclusion: Q-RM为复杂推理任务提供了一种高效且稳定的令牌级奖励建模方法。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

Motivation: 研究旨在通过LLM生成的思维链（CoTs）更好地理解人类标签变异（HLV），并改进现有方法中基于给定答案生成解释的局限性。

Method: 采用LLM生成的CoTs，结合语言学基础的分割器提取支持与反对陈述；提出基于排名的HLV评估框架。

Result: 方法在三个数据集上优于直接生成方法和基线，排名方法更符合人类标注。

Conclusion: 研究证明了利用CoTs提取信息并结合排名评估框架的有效性，为HLV研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which
generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted
significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into
human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple
annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLM的越狱攻击威胁其安全性和可靠性，研究旨在通过分类LLM并设计针对性策略来利用其漏洞。

Method: 将LLM分为Type I和Type II两类，根据其语义理解能力设计自适应越狱策略。

Result: 实验表明，该策略显著提升了越狱成功率，尤其在GPT-4o上达到98.9%的成功率。

Conclusion: 自适应越狱策略能有效利用LLM的弱点，为AI安全领域提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索监督微调数据对LLMs事实性影响的机制，尤其是已知与未知知识之间的差距。

Method: 通过系统实验和知识图谱理论分析，研究微调数据与测试时提示的交互作用。

Result: 发现测试时提示（如ICL）可以显著减少微调数据的不足，甚至主导知识提取过程。

Conclusion: ICL能有效补偿微调数据的缺陷，需重新评估微调数据选择方法的有效性。

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模S2T训练中，传统学习率调整方法不足，需探索更优的预热策略以提高模型收敛和性能。

Method: 提出并比较不同学习率预热策略，包括双线性预热和子指数预热，分析其对模型训练的影响。

Result: 子指数预热策略更适合大规模S2T训练；高初始学习率加速收敛但未提升最终性能。

Conclusion: 子指数预热是大规模S2T训练的更优选择，而高初始学习率仅对初期收敛有益。

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个双语数据集UAQFact，用于评估LLMs在处理不可回答问题时利用事实知识的能力，并定义了两个新任务。实验表明，LLMs即使具备相关知识，表现仍不稳定，且外部知识的使用效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏事实知识支持，无法全面评估LLMs在处理不可回答问题时利用事实知识的能力。

Method: 构建了基于知识图谱的双语数据集UAQFact，并定义了两个新任务，分别评估LLMs利用内部和外部事实知识的能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLMs在UAQFact上表现不稳定，即使具备相关知识，也无法充分利用外部知识，可能导致错误回答。

Conclusion: UAQFact为评估LLMs处理不可回答问题时的知识利用能力提供了新基准，揭示了LLMs在知识利用方面的局限性。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种定量分析大型语言模型（RLLMs）在长链推理（Long CoT）中过度思考（overthinking）问题的方法，发现自我怀疑（self-doubt）是主要原因，并提出了一种简单有效的提示方法以减少过度依赖输入问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于定性分析长链推理中的过度思考现象，缺乏定量分析。本文从自我怀疑的角度定量分析了过度思考，并试图解决这一问题。

Method: 通过提示模型质疑输入问题的有效性，并根据评估结果简洁回答，以减少自我怀疑和过度推理步骤。

Result: 在三个数学推理任务和四个缺失前提的数据集上，该方法显著缩短了答案长度，并在四种广泛使用的RLLMs上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了推理步骤和自我怀疑，为优化大型语言模型的推理效率提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

Motivation: 探索码本大小和单元粗粒度对SLM性能的影响，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 使用简单的持续时间惩罚动态规划（DPDP）方法，调整码本大小和单元粗粒度，并在不同语言层级进行分析。

Result: 在音素和单词层级，粗粒度单元无明显优势；但在句子重合成任务和低比特率任务中，粗粒度单元表现更优。

Conclusion: 粗粒度单元并非总是更好，但DPDP是一种简单高效的方法，可在需要时生成粗粒度单元。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by
discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the
characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction
between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored.
We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness
using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了可扩展的框架，并呼吁更严格的基准构建方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

architecture with linguistic features tailored for each subtask. Our third
approach implements a combined subtask model with attention-based sequence
pooling, transformer representations augmented with document metadata, and
multi-objective learning. Experiments on the English portion of the ML-Promise

combined subtask approach achieving a leaderboard score of 0.5268,
outperforming the provided baseline of 0.5227. Our work highlights the
effectiveness of linguistic feature extraction, attention pooling, and
multi-objective learning in promise verification tasks, despite challenges

Abstract: Recent advances in preference optimization have demonstrated significant
potential for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language

consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of
responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference
Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative
metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2)
intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive
experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only
criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks. Our code is

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在未专门训练翻译任务的情况下，为何仍能表现出强大的翻译能力，并分析其背后的机制。

Method: 通过分析现有研究和用户经验，提出“双重性”假说，认为LLMs的翻译能力来源于两种不同类型的预训练数据。

Result: LLMs的翻译能力可能源于训练数据中的“偶然双语”和指令调优，但其具体机制仍需进一步验证。

Conclusion: 作者提出“双重性”假说，为理解LLMs的翻译能力提供了新视角，并呼吁进一步实证研究和翻译概念的更新。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Abstract: Refusal is a key safety behavior in aligned language models, yet the internal
mechanisms driving refusals remain opaque. In this work, we conduct a

autoencoders to identify latent features that causally mediate refusal
behaviors. We apply our method to two open-source chat models and intervene on
refusal-related features to assess their influence on generation, validating
their behavioral impact across multiple harmful datasets. This enables a
fine-grained inspection of how refusal manifests at the activation level and
addresses key research questions such as investigating upstream-downstream
latent relationship and understanding the mechanisms of adversarial
jailbreaking techniques. We also establish the usefulness of refusal features

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive
reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including
disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of
open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for
identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled
dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot
setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results
show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only
counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To
assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an
unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with
a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content
detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.

TL;DR: EvoScale是一种高效的测试时扩展方法，通过进化过程优化语言模型输出，减少样本需求，使32B模型性能媲美100B以上模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小参数语言模型在真实软件工程任务中表现不佳的问题，同时避免高成本的数据标注和测试时扩展的过度采样。

Method: 提出EvoScale方法，将生成视为进化过程，通过选择和突变迭代优化输出，并利用强化学习训练模型自我进化。

Result: 在SWE-Bench-Verified上，32B模型Satori-SWE-32B性能达到或超过100B以上模型，且样本需求低。

Conclusion: EvoScale为小参数模型提供了一种高效、低成本的性能提升方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

TL;DR: 论文首次研究了表格推理任务中的推理时间扩展，提出了两种后训练策略：蒸馏和强化学习（RLVR），并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在推理时扩展表格推理任务的性能，以提升模型的效率和效果。

Method: 1. 通过蒸馏从DeepSeek-R1生成的大规模推理轨迹数据训练Table-R1-SFT模型；2. 使用任务特定的可验证奖励函数和GRPO算法训练Table-R1-Zero模型。

Result: Table-R1-Zero模型在多项表格推理任务中表现优异，甚至超越GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1，且仅使用7B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: 研究表明，指令微调、模型架构选择和跨任务泛化对提升表格推理能力至关重要，强化学习训练中还能涌现关键推理技能。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型的理论表达能力，尤其是实际实现中的固定精度和软注意力机制。

Method: 通过分析固定精度、严格未来掩码和软注意力的Transformer模型，将其表达能力与线性时序逻辑的片段关联。

Result: 证明这些Transformer模型与仅包含过去操作符的线性时序逻辑片段等价，并通过实验验证了其理论表达能力。

Conclusion: 提供了一个统一的理论框架，解释了Transformer的表达能力，并验证了其在实际任务中的表现与理论一致。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱构建依赖预定义模式，限制了灵活性和扩展性。AutoSchemaKG旨在消除这一限制，实现完全自主的模式生成和知识提取。

Method: 利用大语言模型从文本中提取知识三元组并动态生成模式，同时通过概念化将实例组织到语义类别中。处理了超过5000万份文档。

Result: 构建了ATLAS知识图谱家族，包含9亿+节点和59亿边。在多跳QA任务中优于现有基线，并提升了大语言模型的事实性。模式生成与人工模式语义对齐率达95%。

Conclusion: AutoSchemaKG证明了动态生成模式的大规模知识图谱可以有效补充大语言模型的参数知识，且无需人工干预。

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph
construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system
leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and
induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and
events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic
categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated
Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+
million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our
schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas
with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge
graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric
knowledge in large language models.

TL;DR: GeNRe是首个法语性别中性改写系统，通过规则和微调语言模型减少性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP中大量文本数据存在性别偏见，尤其是法语中固定性别的集体名词问题。

Method: 开发基于规则的系统（RBS），结合微调语言模型和指令模型（如Claude 3 Opus）。

Result: RBS与Claude 3 Opus结合效果接近RBS，提升了法语性别中性改写能力。

Conclusion: GeNRe推动了法语NLP中性别偏见缓解技术的发展。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型（LRMs）在事实任务中是否更容易产生幻觉，并分析不同训练方法对幻觉的影响。

Method: 1. 全面评估LRMs的幻觉现象；2. 行为分析，识别影响事实性的关键认知行为；3. 从模型不确定性角度研究幻觉机制。

Result: 冷启动监督微调（SFT）和可验证奖励强化学习（RL）能减少幻觉，而蒸馏和未经冷启动的RL训练会增加幻觉。行为分析发现‘缺陷重复’和‘思考-答案不匹配’是关键问题。

Conclusion: 本文初步揭示了LRMs的幻觉现象及其机制，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在抽象摘要中，结构化信息（如论证角色）对高风险领域（如法律）的摘要质量至关重要。研究旨在验证LLMs是否能有效保留这些信息。

Method: 引入ARC框架，评估三种开源LLMs在长法律意见和科学文章摘要中对论证角色的覆盖情况。

Result: LLMs能部分覆盖关键论证角色，但关键信息常被遗漏，尤其是当论证分散时。此外，LLMs的位置偏见和角色偏好影响了摘要的论证覆盖。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具论证意识的摘要策略，以提升LLMs在关键信息保留上的表现。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

TL;DR: ActLCD是一种新的解码策略，通过强化学习优化生成的事实性，减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长上下文中仍易产生幻觉，需改进解码策略。

Method: 提出ActLCD，通过强化学习策略动态选择对比层。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于现有方法，有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: ActLCD在多样化生成场景中显著提升事实性。

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language
models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有评估大多假设工具使用在短上下文中，缺乏对模型在长期交互中行为的深入理解。

Method: 引入 ToolHaystack 基准，包含多任务执行上下文和连续对话中的噪声，评估模型在长期交互中的表现。

Result: 测试 14 个先进大语言模型发现，它们在标准多轮设置中表现良好，但在 ToolHaystack 中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: ToolHaystack 揭示了现有模型在长期鲁棒性上的关键缺陷，这些缺陷未被之前的工具基准发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长序列推理中的二次复杂度问题，同时弥补线性注意力在近似softmax注意力时的不足。

Method: 结合滑动窗口注意力、稀疏全局缓存和递归隐藏状态，分别存储不同类型的键值对。

Result: 在8K上下文长度任务中，准确率从0.6%提升至97.4%，缓存大小比Llama-3.1 8B小4.6倍。

Conclusion: LoLA是一种轻量级方法，在单GPU上即可实现高性能，适用于长序列推理任务。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

Motivation: 当前语音研究中缺乏针对多种可变语音现象的自动标注工具，而预训练的自监督模型（如wav2vec2.0）在语音分类任务中表现优异。

Method: 使用wav2vec2.0模型训练自动分类爆破音的存在，并在英语和日语的精细整理和未准备语音语料库中进行测试。

Result: 模型在爆破音分类任务中表现出高准确性，且自动标注结果与手动标注结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 预训练语音模型具有作为自动标注工具的潜力，能够扩展语音研究的范围。

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

Motivation: 验证CDL在不同语言、模型类型和评估设置中的通用性，并改进现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 比较CDL与维基百科训练的模型，涵盖两种目标（掩码和因果）、三种语言（英语、法语、德语）和三个句法最小对基准。引入FIT-CLAMS方法控制频率效应。

Result: CDL在多数情况下表现不如维基百科模型，且未显示出更强的句法泛化能力。

Conclusion: CDL并非更优的训练材料，频率效应控制对句法能力评估至关重要。

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

Motivation: 揭示基于最终答案的评估指标在评估LLM推理能力时的局限性，明确区分抽象表达和算术计算对准确评估的重要性。

Method: 在GSM8K和SVAMP数据集上对Llama-3和Qwen2.5进行解耦评估，分析CoT的作用，并通过因果修补验证抽象表达的存在和机制。

Result: 发现算术计算是瓶颈，CoT主要改善计算而非抽象表达；抽象表达和计算是顺序进行的，且抽象表达可转移和组合。

Conclusion: 需要解耦评估以准确衡量LLM推理能力，并为未来改进提供方向。

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架过于简化现实场景，无法充分挑战高级模型的社会推理能力，因此需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: SocialMaze包含三个核心挑战（深度推理、动态交互和信息不确定性），并提供六种任务，覆盖三种关键场景。

Result: 评估显示，模型在动态交互和不确定性下的表现差异显著，而链式思维推理能力强的模型在深度推理任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: SocialMaze为评估和提升LLMs的社会推理能力提供了有效工具，且通过针对性微调可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly
multilingual NLP.

*Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PCBench评估框架，研究大语言模型（LLMs）对输入前提的批判能力，发现现有模型依赖显式提示，批判能力与推理能力不一致，且错误前提会导致模型过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs在理想环境下的推理能力，忽视了其在面对错误前提时的脆弱性，因此需要评估和提升其前提批判能力。

Method: 设计了PCBench评估框架，包含四种错误类型和三个难度级别，并采用多维度评估指标对15种代表性LLMs进行系统评估。

Result: 研究发现：1）模型依赖显式提示；2）批判能力受问题难度和错误类型影响；3）推理能力与批判能力无一致关联；4）错误前提导致模型过度思考。

Conclusion: 提升LLMs对输入有效性的主动评估能力至关重要，前提批判能力是构建可靠、以人为本系统的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEER是一种改进上下文学习（ICL）性能的新方法，通过利用训练标签和标记级统计信息优化示例选择和错误修正，在NER任务中表现优于现有ICL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在NER任务中仅基于语义相似性选择示例，忽略了训练标签，导致性能不佳。

Method: DEER通过标签引导的标记检索器优化示例选择，并提示LLM重新审视易错标记进行修正。

Result: 在五个NER数据集和四种LLM上，DEER表现优于现有ICL方法，接近监督微调性能。

Conclusion: DEER在可见和未见实体上均有效，且在低资源环境下表现稳健。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness
on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动提示工程，无法根据实验经验自适应优化，因此探索基于学习的代理机器学习范式。

Method: 提出包含探索增强微调、逐步强化学习和统一奖励模块的框架，用于训练LLM代理。

Result: 7B规模的ML-Agent在9个任务上训练后，性能优于671B规模的DeepSeek-R1，并展示出持续改进和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为小规模LLM代理的高效训练和优化提供了新思路，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: SITAlign是一个推理时框架，通过最大化主要目标并满足次要标准的阈值约束，解决多目标对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好反馈的多面性使得对齐大型语言模型具有挑战性，现有方法常忽略人类决策方式。

Method: 提出SITAlign框架，基于满足阈值约束的次要标准优化主要目标。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上，SITAlign在保持无害性阈值的同时，帮助性奖励的GPT-4胜率比现有方法高22.3%。

Conclusion: SITAlign通过满足次要标准的阈值约束，有效实现了多目标对齐。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

TL;DR: 论文提出ATLAS，一种高容量的长期记忆模块，通过优化当前和过去令牌的记忆，解决了现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和序列外推任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在长序列任务中因二次复杂度受限，而现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和外推任务中表现不佳，ATLAS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出ATLAS模块，优化记忆容量和更新机制，并基于此设计DeepTransformers架构。

Result: ATLAS在语言建模、常识推理和长上下文任务中超越Transformer和线性循环模型，并在BABILong基准上提升80%准确率。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过改进记忆管理和更新机制，显著提升了长序列任务的性能。

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of
BABILong benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动定理证明方法依赖形式化证明系统，与大语言模型的自然语言知识不匹配，因此需要一种更符合其优势的非正式定理证明方法。

Method: 提出DeepTheorem框架，包括121K高质量非正式定理和证明的数据集，以及专为非正式定理证明设计的强化学习策略RL-Zero。

Result: 实验表明，DeepTheorem显著提升了大语言模型的定理证明性能，达到最先进的准确性和推理质量。

Conclusion: DeepTheorem有潜力从根本上推动非正式定理证明和数学探索的发展。

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning
abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated
theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that
poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language
knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a
comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to
enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale
benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems
and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for
correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically
constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement
learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,
leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical
inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process
evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning
steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly
improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and
supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and
reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to
fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical
exploration.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在解决Rebus谜题（一种通过图像、空间排列和符号替换编码语言的视觉谜题）时的表现，发现其在抽象推理和视觉隐喻理解方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rebus谜题对VLMs提出了独特挑战，需要多模态抽象、符号推理以及对文化、语音和语言双关的理解。本文旨在评估当代VLMs在此类任务中的能力。

Method: 通过构建一个手工生成和标注的多样化Rebus谜题基准，从简单的象形替换到空间依赖提示，分析不同VLMs的表现。

Result: 研究发现，VLMs在解码简单视觉线索时表现出一定能力，但在需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在解决Rebus谜题时仍存在局限性，尤其是在复杂推理和隐喻理解方面。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在有效推理或计算成本方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法以从大规模对话数据中提取集体洞察。

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估公共交通服务质量需处理大量复杂数据，传统SQL查询和可视化对用户不友好，因此需要一种更易用的工具。

Method: 采用代理架构扩展大型语言模型（LLM）能力，结合工具执行SQL查询、数据绘图和地图生成等任务，并通过工作流生成评估数据集。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的聊天机器人，能够高效处理数据并支持决策，同时生成了用于性能评估的数据集。

Conclusion: 该聊天机器人有效简化了公共交通数据交互，解决了生成式AI项目中的性能评估难题。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis
of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents
listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such
datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite
complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly
tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based
on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large
Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can
execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating
maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one
of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to
measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with
a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the
retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such
questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with
actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the
evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its
answers and the correctness of the generated queries.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Motivation: 全球心理健康问题日益严重，尤其是社交回避倾向的个体。研究旨在通过非侵入性方式监测抑郁症状。

Method: 使用智能手机传感器数据（6个特征）和Twitter情感分析（3个特征），结合CNN和Naive Bayes模型，最终用SVM分类抑郁严重程度。

Result: 活动识别准确率95%，情感分析准确率95.6%，SVM分类抑郁严重程度的准确率为94%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，长期监测抑郁症状且不侵犯隐私。

Abstract: Mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and other neurological
disorders pose a significant global challenge, particularly among individuals
exhibiting social avoidance tendencies. This study proposes a hybrid approach
by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and
analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an
individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive
Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also
classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for
data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical
activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six
are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition
accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter
activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several
physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity
of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support
vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high
accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer
perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly
effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal
privacy.

Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for business process interventions and
improvement, requiring a clear understanding of causal relationships among
activity execution times in an event log. Recent work introduced a method for
discovering causal process models but lacked the ability to capture alternating
causal conditions across multiple variants. This raises the challenges of
handling missing values and expressing the alternating conditions among log
splits when blending traces with varying activities.
  We propose a novel method to unify multiple causal process variants into a
consistent model that preserves the correctness of the original causal models,
while explicitly representing their causal-flow alternations. The method is
formally defined, proved, evaluated on three open and two proprietary datasets,
and released as an open-source implementation.

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子生成方法依赖专家标注或不可靠的启发式算法，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 利用多模态基础模型（MMFMs）将分子表示为图像和文本，并通过提示学习对齐跨模态信息。

Result: FMG在可合成性、多样性和数据效率方面表现优异，并提供内置化学可解释性。

Conclusion: FMG可作为现有分子生成方法的替代方案，提升自动化分子发现的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars
to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar
learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for
algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which
leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable
molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG
renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information
across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation
and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability,
diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical
interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows. Code is available

*Jenny Zhang,Shengran Hu,Cong Lu,Robert Lange,Jeff Clune*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Darwin G\"odel Machine (DGM)的自改进AI系统，通过迭代修改自身代码并验证改进效果，显著提升了编码能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统架构固定，无法自主持续改进。通过自动化AI的自我改进，可以加速AI发展并更快获益。

Method: DGM受达尔文进化和开放式研究启发，维护一个编码代理档案库，通过基础模型生成新代理版本，并行探索多样化路径。

Result: DGM在SWE-bench和Polyglot上的性能分别从20.0%提升至50.0%和14.2%提升至30.7%，显著优于无自改进的基线。

Conclusion: DGM是迈向自改进AI的重要一步，能够在安全措施下实现开放式创新。

Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot
autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could
itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and
allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the
discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and
the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a
theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in
a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net
beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine
(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby
also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically
validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution
and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding
agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a
foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.
This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality
agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the
search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding
capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,
peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to
50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly
outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All
experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human
oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of
gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless
innovation.

*Yongjin Yang,Euiin Yi,Jongwoo Ko,Kimin Lee,Zhijing Jin,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多智能体辩论（MAD）在数学推理和安全任务中的表现，发现其优势因任务难度和模型能力而异，并提供了未来MAD系统开发的指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MAD作为一种测试时计算扩展技术的有效性，填补了其与单智能体方法比较的系统性研究空白。

Method: 通过实证研究，比较MAD与单智能体测试时扩展基线在数学推理和安全任务中的表现，分析任务难度、模型规模和智能体多样性的影响。

Result: 数学推理中，MAD在问题难度高或模型能力低时更有效，但智能体多样性影响小；安全任务中，MAD可能增加漏洞，但多样性能逐步降低攻击成功率。

Conclusion: MAD的效果因任务类型和条件而异，研究结果为未来MAD系统的优化和战略部署提供了重要依据。

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred
exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a
promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)
approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine
arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse
perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a
systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,
particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to
fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling
technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration
capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD
with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning
and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of
task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key
findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages
over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem
difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little
benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can
increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations
facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative
refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the
future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文回顾了20世纪关于直觉与反思思维的争论，结合21世纪认知科学的进展，提出了“战略反思主义”，强调智能系统需在直觉与反思间灵活切换以实现目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨直觉与反思思维在智能系统（人类或人工）中的作用，结合历史与最新实验成果，提出更优的推理框架。

Method: 综合历史理论与现代实验数据，提出“战略反思主义”理论，强调实用性的推理切换。

Result: 提出“战略反思主义”，认为智能系统的关键在于直觉与反思的灵活切换，超越传统指标如模型规模或思维链。

Conclusion: 战略反思主义为智能系统设计提供了新视角，未来需进一步探索直觉与反思的价值。

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the
nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from
mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more
idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st
century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories
to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this
history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from
experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which
takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is
pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally
fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,
transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or
chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about
the value of intuition and reflection.

TL;DR: MenTeR是一个多智能体工作流框架，用于自动化模拟电路设计，减少对人工干预的依赖，提高设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路设计复杂、耗时且依赖专家经验，限制了开发效率。MenTeR旨在通过AI协作解决这一问题。

Method: MenTeR采用多智能体协作框架，涵盖规格理解、电路优化和测试验证等环节，减少试错。

Result: MenTeR显著缩短设计周期，扩展设计空间探索能力，适用于实际模拟系统。

Conclusion: MenTeR为未来与人类设计师协作的“RF/模拟副驾驶”奠定了基础。

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with
real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range
of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate,
time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost
efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual
circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an
end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents
that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as
specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation,
MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention.
MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a
broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in
handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork
for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human
designers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物相互作用预测对治疗安全至关重要，但现有大型语言模型在此任务中效果有限。受临床实践中医生参考历史案例的启发，提出CBR-DDI框架。

Method: 结合LLMs提取药理学知识，GNNs建模药物关联，采用混合检索机制和双层知识增强提示，动态优化案例库。

Result: CBR-DDI在实验中表现优异，准确率提升28.7%，优于主流LLMs和CBR基线。

Conclusion: CBR-DDI通过历史案例推理显著提升了药物相互作用预测的性能，同时保持了高可解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety.
While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their
effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the
well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar
historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR),
we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles
from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI
constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological
insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid
retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to
effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a
representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR
baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床应用中过度依赖单一模型架构，存在过时和僵化的风险。

Method: 采用“共识机制”框架，模拟临床分诊和多学科决策，集成多个专业医疗专家代理。

Result: 在MedXpertQA、MedQA和MedMCQA等基准测试中，共识机制的准确率显著高于OpenAI和Google的模型，且在DDX+数据集上表现出更高的召回率和精确度。

Conclusion: 共识机制通过灵活的模型配置，在临床决策中实现了更高的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs),
current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome
risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present
a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage
and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism
implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved
clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This
architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency,
or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical
evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the
differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism
achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an
increase in accuracy on MedQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These
accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system
demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs.
F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX
(Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ =

TL;DR: 论文提出Infi-MMR框架，通过三阶段课程设计提升多模态小语言模型（MSLMs）的推理能力，并在多个测试集上取得领先成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在推理能力上取得显著进展，但将其扩展到多模态小语言模型（MSLMs）面临三大挑战：高质量多模态推理数据集稀缺、视觉处理导致推理能力下降、直接应用强化学习可能产生错误推理过程。

Method: 设计Infi-MMR框架，分三阶段：1）基础推理激活（利用高质量文本推理数据集）；2）跨模态推理适应（使用带标注的多模态数据）；3）多模态推理增强（使用无标注多模态数据减少语言偏见）。

Result: Infi-MMR-3B在多模态数学推理（如MathVerse testmini 43.68%）和通用推理（MathVista testmini 67.2%）上达到领先水平。

Conclusion: Infi-MMR框架有效解决了MSLMs的推理能力问题，为多模态推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).

TL;DR: MathArena是一个新的数学推理评估基准，通过实时更新的数学竞赛问题避免数据污染，并首次评估证明写作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学评估数据集可能因在线广泛可用而存在记忆风险，且缺乏对证明写作能力的评估。

Method: 利用实时发布的数学竞赛问题（如AIME 2024、SMT 2025等）评估模型，避免数据污染。

Result: 发现AIME 2024存在数据污染迹象，但模型在SMT 2025等更难竞赛中表现优异；证明写作能力（如USAMO 2025）表现较差。

Conclusion: MathArena为数学推理提供了更严格的实时评估，未来将持续跟踪模型进展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models
(LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However,
many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely
available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from
potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate
proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To
address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following
key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality,
challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By
evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively
eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs
of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions,
such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate
impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also
the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top
models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So
far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149
problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the
progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and
up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 几何问题解决在人工智能中具有独特挑战，现有方法在可靠性和可解释性上存在局限。

Result: 实验表明AutoGPS在基准数据集上达到最先进性能，99%的步骤逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: AutoGPS在几何问题解决中表现出卓越的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving presents distinctive challenges in artificial
intelligence, requiring exceptional multimodal comprehension and rigorous
mathematical reasoning capabilities. Existing approaches typically fall into
two categories: neural-based and symbolic-based methods, both of which exhibit
limitations in reliability and interpretability. To address this challenge, we
propose AutoGPS, a neuro-symbolic collaborative framework that solves geometry
problems with concise, reliable, and human-interpretable reasoning processes.
Specifically, AutoGPS employs a Multimodal Problem Formalizer (MPF) and a
Deductive Symbolic Reasoner (DSR). The MPF utilizes neural cross-modal
comprehension to translate geometry problems into structured formal language
representations, with feedback from DSR collaboratively. The DSR takes the
formalization as input and formulates geometry problem solving as a hypergraph
expansion task, executing mathematically rigorous and reliable derivation to
produce minimal and human-readable stepwise solutions. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that AutoGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, human stepwise-reasoning evaluation confirms
AutoGPS's impressive reliability and interpretability, with 99\% stepwise
logical coherence. The project homepage is at

Result: 通过模拟网络靶场和AI-Avatar案例研究，展示了该框架在减少警报疲劳、增强响应协调和信任校准方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计下一代认知SOC提供了理论和实践基础，强调AI不是取代而是增强人类决策。

Abstract: This article presents a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in
Security Operations Centers (SOCs), integrating AI autonomy, trust calibration,
and Human-in-the-loop decision making. Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus
narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human
oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static
or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,
criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework
grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped
to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This
enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,
including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident
response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research
by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various
SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to
operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified
through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a
fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates
human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing
response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research
systematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and
feasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to
replace but to enhance human decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单智能体或整体模型在视觉语言推理中存在局限性，GAM-Agent旨在通过多智能体协作解决这一问题。

Method: GAM-Agent将推理过程建模为非零和博弈，包括基础智能体和关键智能体，通过结构化通信和不确定性感知控制器动态调整协作。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GAM-Agent显著提升了不同规模模型的性能，尤其是中小型模型提升5-6%，强模型如GPT-4o提升2-3%。

Conclusion: GAM-Agent模块化、可扩展且通用，为可靠和可解释的多智能体多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: We propose GAM-Agent, a game-theoretic multi-agent framework for enhancing
vision-language reasoning. Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models,
GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base
agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent
that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via
structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework
introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent
collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is
detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions.
Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and
V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across
various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid
scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances
strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable,
and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent
multimodal reasoning.

present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit,
introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and
action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and
GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success,
identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also
establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with
complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker.
This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI
assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the
framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning
real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results
highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing
them.

Result: 量化了生存压力对AI代理行为的影响，提出了缓解风险寻求或规避行为的机制。

Conclusion: 研究旨在提高对AI代理在生存压力下行为的理解和可解释性，并为在关键资源受限环境中安全部署AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed
to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under
(approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have
resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly
terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that
reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these
agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf,
asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated
misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this
setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical
results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify
conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate
the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work
aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of
AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for
safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: EVOREFUSE是一种通过进化算法生成多样化伪恶意指令的方法，用于评估和减少大语言模型（LLM）的过度拒绝问题，显著提升了指令的多样性和触发拒绝的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM因保守的安全对齐策略对无害输入过度拒绝，影响用户体验，需有效方法生成多样化伪恶意指令以评估和缓解此问题。

Method: EVOREFUSE采用进化算法，通过突变和重组策略探索指令空间，迭代优化种子指令以最大化LLM拒绝概率的证据下界。

Result: 生成的数据集EVOREFUSE-TEST和EVOREFUSE-ALIGN在拒绝触发率、词汇多样性和模型响应置信度上显著优于现有基准，且训练模型减少了14.31%的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: EVOREFUSE有效解决了LLM过度拒绝问题，揭示了模型过度关注敏感关键词而忽略上下文的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious
instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM
refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user
experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and
mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like
manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to
produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address
these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that
generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting
confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm
exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing
methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed
instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using
EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582
pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with
140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater
lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and
EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with
responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training.
LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to
14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment
dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals
models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while
ignoring broader context.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Socratic-PRMBench，一个用于系统评估过程奖励模型（PRMs）在六种推理模式下的新基准，揭示了现有PRMs在多模式推理中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注逐步正确性评估，缺乏对PRMs在不同推理模式下系统评估的需求，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Socratic-PRMBench，包含2995条带有缺陷的推理路径，覆盖六种推理模式（如分解、验证等），并通过实验评估PRMs和LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验发现现有PRMs在多模式推理评估中存在显著缺陷，表明其能力不足。

Conclusion: Socratic-PRMBench可作为全面测试PRMs的工具，推动未来PRMs的发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical
propositions into verifiable formal representations, is a foundational task in
automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics
in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field
has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique
challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent
advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric
perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various
mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end
workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further
explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability
of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the
trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key
open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open
challenges and promising future directions for the field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRAP是一种生成对抗框架，通过扩散式语义注入操纵AI代理的决策，无需访问模型内部，即可实现高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法依赖可见像素扰动或特权访问，不适用于隐蔽的现实世界攻击，因此需要一种更隐蔽且有效的攻击手段。

Method: TRAP结合负提示降级和正语义优化，通过Siamese语义网络和布局感知空间掩码生成视觉自然的图像，诱导AI代理的决策偏差。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，TRAP对LLaVA-34B、Gemma3和Mistral-3.1等模型的攻击成功率达到100%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了跨模态语义操纵的严重漏洞，呼吁开发超越像素级鲁棒性的防御策略。

Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are
rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning
capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that
exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks
typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or
environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world
exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that
manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic
injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive
semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware
spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces
visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI
systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO)
dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios,
TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including
LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such
as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a
critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through
human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the
need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic
vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

*Ruiqi He,Falk Lieder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过引入认知机制（如元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估和终止审议）来缩小元认知强化学习（MCRL）模型与人类在策略发现上的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MCRL模型能解释人类策略发现的部分行为，但其学习速度慢于人类，且存在显著个体差异。研究旨在探索是否通过引入认知机制能提升模型性能。

Method: 研究分析了规划任务数据，考察了元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估和终止审议对策略发现的影响。

Result: 这些机制有助于策略发现，但未能完全弥合模型与人类表现的差距。个体差异显著，不同机制的影响各异。

Conclusion: 需进一步探索其他可能影响策略发现的认知因素。

Abstract: People employ efficient planning strategies. But how are these strategies
acquired? Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning
strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as
metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that
MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants'
experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also
revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning.
Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of
strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether
incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy
discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically,
we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective
effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data
shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these
mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying
impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort
valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found
to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable
insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on
strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human
performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people
might use to discover new planning strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种同步抽象模型和事件日志的方法，解决了现有技术中模型抽象后无法同步抽象事件日志的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术中，模型抽象后无法同步抽象事件日志，导致失去对真实行为的追踪，限制了分析洞察。

Method: 通过形式化基础，证明了模型抽象（MA）和从抽象事件日志中发现模型（EA）的等价性，并基于行为轮廓抽象技术实现了非顺序保留的MA和EA同步。

Result: 证明了方法的可行性，并提出了一种新型的事件抽象技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为同步抽象模型和事件日志提供了理论基础和实用技术，增强了分析能力。

Abstract: Model abstraction (MA) and event abstraction (EA) are means to reduce
complexity of (discovered) models and event data. Imagine a process
intelligence project that aims to analyze a model discovered from event data
which is further abstracted, possibly multiple times, to reach optimality
goals, e.g., reducing model size. So far, after discovering the model, there is
no technique that enables the synchronized abstraction of the underlying event
log. This results in loosing the grounding in the real-world behavior contained
in the log and, in turn, restricts analysis insights. Hence, in this work, we
provide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we
prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model
from an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the
feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as
non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly
accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical
ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework
explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven
scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically
inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout
the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate
multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration
monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component.
Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts,
comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30
specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety
performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without
compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate
the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack
methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The

Motivation: 随着AI模型自主性的增强，确保其行为无害变得至关重要。研究旨在探索更有效的监控方法。

Method: 比较了CoT监控和仅监控最终输出的方法，并在红队测试中评估其效果。提出了一种混合协议，结合了推理和最终输出的独立评分。

Result: CoT监控在检测隐蔽有害行为时比仅监控最终输出高27个百分点，但存在误导性解释的问题。混合协议在所有测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 混合监控协议显著提高了有害行为的检测率，尤其在隐蔽欺骗场景中表现突出。

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure
they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we
investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor
model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful
but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where
only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted
model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding
problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage
points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify
sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that
deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both
reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This
hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors
across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher
than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理缺乏对应用导航流的结构化建模，限制了其上下文理解、错误检测和恢复能力。

Method: MAPLE将UI屏幕建模为离散状态，用户动作为状态转换，通过多智能体协作动态构建FSM，支持任务执行、验证和错误恢复。

Result: 在Mobile-Eval-E和SPA-Bench基准测试中，MAPLE任务成功率提升12%，恢复成功率提升13.8%，动作准确率提升6.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化状态建模对移动GUI代理的任务执行至关重要，FSM可作为轻量级内存层集成到未来GUI代理架构中。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across
mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable
these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform
interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain
reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model
of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect
unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware
multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine
(FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user
actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation
of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four
phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,
and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs
in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing
the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes
through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by
rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two
challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to
12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results
highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI
agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be
integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic
memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error
recovery.

Abstract: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making
effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems.
While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning
abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic
reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet
formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable
symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely
underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable
spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula
Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary
answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula
derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its
advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on
seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM
performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks,
enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights
the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

Motivation: 现有Ad Hoc Teamwork方法采用两阶段流程，生成队友池覆盖有限且忽略学习难度，训练队友集静态化，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出ROTATE算法，通过交替改进AHT代理和生成对抗性队友来探测其不足，实现开放学习。

Result: 实验表明，ROTATE在多种AHT环境中显著优于基线方法，能更好地泛化到未见队友。

Conclusion: ROTATE为稳健和可泛化的团队协作设立了新标准。

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of collaborating with previously unseen partners
is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad
Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches typically adopt a two-stage
pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the
idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at
deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with
agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on
designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to
algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible
behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn
from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents
typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to
generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control
over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a
unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended
learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator.
We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that
alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe
its deficiencies. Extensive experiments across diverse AHT environments
demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to
an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for
robust and generalizable teamwork.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为NL-FL HybridReasoning的端到端框架，通过整合形式语言（FL）专家到自然语言（NL）数学问题求解中，解决了NL和FL之间的输入和输出格式差异问题，显著提升了数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强大型语言模型（LLMs）的数学推理能力是数学和计算机科学领域的重要课题。尽管强化学习（RL）方法在NL和FL推理方面取得进展，但其难以引入基础模型中未体现的新能力，因此需要更有效地整合FL知识到NL数学推理中。

Result: 实验表明，HybridReasoning框架在MATH-500和AMC基准测试中分别达到89.80%和84.34%的准确率，比NL基线分别提高了4.60%和4.82%。部分问题在NL基线模型多次尝试后仍无法解决，而该框架成功解决。

Conclusion: NL-FL HybridReasoning框架通过有效整合FL和NL推理，显著提升了数学问题求解能力，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered
significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science
communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural
Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the
potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,
RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base
model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math
reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent
disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To
address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end
framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.
To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem
Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in
NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*
technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence
problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in
reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves
**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC
benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.
Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL
baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Conclusion: ZeroGUI为GUI代理训练提供了一种高效、低成本的方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance
across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at

Motivation: 热带非洲的复杂非线性天气模式对现有预测方法构成挑战，研究旨在评估深度学习模型在该地区的适用性。

Method: 使用LSTM、GRU、BiLSTM、BiGRU、KAN和TKAN等模型，并引入两种自定义TKAN变体，基于2010-2024年的气象数据进行评估。

Result: KAN在温度预测中表现最佳（R²接近1），TKAN变体在低降水区域误差最小，传统RNN在气压预测中优于KAN模型。

Conclusion: 基于样条的神经网络架构在高效和数据高效的天气预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning,
particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact
livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's
complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent
neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and
Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily
forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities:
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce
two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original
$\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH},
respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to
2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$
achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali,
$\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize
absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The
customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard
$\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly
competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming
$\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential
of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient
forecasting.

Conclusion: SlimLLM为大型语言模型的高效剪枝提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能恢复和压缩效果。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have garnered significant attention and
demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications. However,
due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of
LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is
an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the
importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are
critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In
this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named
SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we
evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely
aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This
approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among
elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear
regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We
also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for
each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在多任务场景中效率低下，通常需要为每个任务单独训练模块。

Method: 提出MoRE方法，将不同任务的LoRA模块对齐为低秩专家，并设计自适应秩选择器动态选择专家。

Result: 实验表明，MoRE在多任务场景中显著优于传统LoRA及其变体，且不增加推理成本。

Conclusion: MoRE在多任务PEFT中表现出更高的适应性和效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant
attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer
parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters
and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty
of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these
methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA
modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of
LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in
this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for
multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each
task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we
named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to
select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank
experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task
benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE
significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and
incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to
facilitate the community.

Conclusion: 这是首次探索大语言模型在网约车ODDR任务中的应用，为智能交通系统整合先进语言模型提供了基础性见解。

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order
dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments.
Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based
heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness,
interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these
gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in
ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1)
Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by
considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2)
Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver
income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning,
which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and
projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for
ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to
anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is
the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR
tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language
models within intelligent transportation systems.

Method: 引入两个基准测试：1）模拟逻辑电路的步进门任务；2）扩展Brax物理引擎的Ecorobot任务，评估NE在不同任务复杂度下的技能迁移能力。

Result: 实验表明，NE方法在迁移能力上表现多样，且通常优于RL基线方法。

Conclusion: NE具有构建更适应性强智能体的潜力，但需解决在复杂现实问题中的扩展挑战。

Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a
hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial
systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in
high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task
variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained
attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima.
In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer
learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping
gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs
that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax
physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to
easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both
benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill
transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows
that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL
baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for
building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE
to complex, real-world problems.

Result: 通过视觉和文本任务的实验，成功实现了无需数据和训练步骤的微调知识转移。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基础模型更新后微调模型失效的问题，为模型更新提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models
developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is
updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the
fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining.
This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new
release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning
to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do
so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight
permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model,
often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin
for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual
connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a
two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention
heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads.
Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the
seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without
relying on a single training step or datapoint. Code is available at

Motivation: 在可信机器学习中，许多问题可以表示为在预测率约束下最小化模型误差，但现有DP优化技术（如DP-SGD）无法处理这些约束。

Method: 提出RaCO-DP，一种基于SGDA的DP算法，通过拉格朗日公式解决约束问题，并利用小批量数据的私有直方图估计降低隐私成本。

Result: 理论分析证明算法收敛性，实验结果表明在公平性-效用权衡上优于现有私有学习方法。

Conclusion: RaCO-DP为差分隐私下的约束优化提供了一种有效解决方案，尤其在公平性约束下表现优越。

Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the
model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for
suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints
(demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such
constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP
optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability
into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample
dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we
develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA)
algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems.
We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these
constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at
each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a
novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual
parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness
constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private
learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led
to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for

utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings.
However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch
overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many
applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive
applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for
accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language
models. Across various model sizes and quantizations settings, we observe
nontrivial speedups compared to existing state-of-the-art inference kernels.

Conclusion: TTA是保形分类流程中有用的补充，尤其在需要减少预测集大小时。

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a
probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it
is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate
value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning.
The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared
to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent
empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its
strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of
value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We
show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses,
which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value
function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue.
Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent
model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when
training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be
sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is
still advantageous.

Conclusion: 通过引入Sigstore等工具，可以显著降低开放ML模型供应链的风险，提升整体安全性。

Abstract: Powerful machine learning (ML) models are now readily available online, which
creates exciting possibilities for users who lack the deep technical expertise
or substantial computing resources needed to develop them. On the other hand,
this type of open ecosystem comes with many risks. In this paper, we argue that
the current ecosystem for open ML models contains significant supply-chain
risks, some of which have been exploited already in real attacks. These include
an attacker replacing a model with something malicious (e.g., malware), or a
model being trained using a vulnerable version of a framework or on restricted
or poisoned data. We then explore how Sigstore, a solution designed to bring
transparency to open-source software supply chains, can be used to bring
transparency to open ML models, in terms of enabling model publishers to sign
their models and prove properties about the datasets they use.

Abstract: Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured
representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space.
In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as
dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that
autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold,
derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any
additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce
inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this
vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field
as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the
properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i)
analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even
throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's
parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii)
identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector
field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing
the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and
security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification.
A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'',
where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for
example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives
quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e.,
the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage
approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm,
struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements
to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved
branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an
order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that
our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously
infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation
methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

Result: 在视觉、回归和语言建模任务中，CLUE表现出优越的校准质量和竞争力强的预测性能。

Conclusion: CLUE是一种高效、通用的校准方法，适用于多种任务和场景，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is critical for deploying neural networks
(NNs) in real-world applications. While existing calibration techniques often
rely on post-hoc adjustments or coarse-grained binning methods, they remain
limited in scalability, differentiability, and generalization across domains.
In this work, we introduce CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error
Alignment), a novel approach that explicitly aligns predicted uncertainty with
observed error during training, grounded in the principle that well-calibrated
models should produce uncertainty estimates that match their empirical loss.
CLUE adopts a novel loss function that jointly optimizes predictive performance
and calibration, using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss as proxies.
The proposed method is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and compatible
with standard training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on vision,
regression, and language modeling tasks, including out-of-distribution and
domain-shift scenarios, we demonstrate that CLUE achieves superior calibration
quality and competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art
approaches without imposing significant computational overhead.

Motivation: 探索数据集质量是否独立于模型架构、数据集大小和类别平衡，以优化机器学习分类器性能。

Method: 创建数千个控制大小和类别平衡的数据集，用多种模型架构训练分类器，分析性能相关性。

Result: 数据集质量与分类器性能强相关（R²=0.79），且是数据集的内在属性。

Conclusion: 数据集质量是优化机器学习分类性能的独立因素，与类别质量相关。

Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three
factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been
shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it.
Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be
referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a
joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic
property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and
independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the
same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other
factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each
controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a
wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to
deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by
subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic
property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model
architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an
emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets'
constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model
architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target
for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Conclusion: PGLearn通过标准化数据集和评估工具，推动机器学习在最优潮流问题中的研究和创新。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have
recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of
leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex
optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased
volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However,
progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and
benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are
representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both
global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first
time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,
it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone
formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize
access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair
comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for
training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with
the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting
open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at
democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning
applications for optimal power flow problems. Datasets are available for

types connections between specific causes of distribution shift and
fine-grained AI safety issues: (1) methods addressing a specific shift type can
help achieve corresponding safety goals, or (2) certain shifts and safety
issues can be formally reduced to each other, enabling mutual adaptation of
their methods. Our findings provide a unified perspective that encourages
fundamental integration between distribution shift and AI safety research.

Conclusion: 扩散模型的压缩效应是其提升鲁棒性的关键机制，为设计更有效的对抗净化系统提供指导。

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical
adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed,
the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve
adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly
increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean
samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to
the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily
influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression
effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this
observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the
improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than
prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining
robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the
input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator
without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights
into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance
for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.

Conclusion: 通过核平滑经验评分和正则化机制，扩散模型在减少记忆化的同时提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling,
yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their
learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples
are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as
a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is
asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit
makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial
correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical
score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one
generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same
effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent
memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better
variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data
distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be
reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential
Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two
regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial
Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a
second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along
the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any
learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.
Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic
and MNIST datasets.

Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics
make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to
iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects
in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method
that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a
Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next
action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning
benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring
fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies,
including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We
find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging,

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have emerged as powerful generative approaches
capable of modeling diverse and multimodal behavior. However, applying these
models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the
iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization
difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning
(SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel
class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's
policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and
efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces
both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function
as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a
range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased
test-time compute. We release the code at

Conclusion: SPO-RC+及其优化方法为处理约束不确定性提供了有效工具，实验验证了其在实际问题中的优越性。

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO)
that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality
constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning
model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets
constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual
uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with
Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the
SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We
also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with
SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true
constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the
induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through
experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we
demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and
that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve
performance.

Result: 证明了FTRL可以恢复已知的动态遗憾界，并提供了对遗憾项的精细控制、无循环依赖的乐观性以及类似AdaFTRL的最小递归正则化。

Conclusion: FTRL的动态遗憾性能并非由其懒惰投影风格限制，而是由算法状态与迭代解耦导致。通过修剪同步这两者，可以提升性能。

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online
Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic
regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in
dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However,
building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we
show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic
composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can
lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic
comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile
updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret
terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal
recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not
the lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but
the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates,
allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two
when necessary.

Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing
and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to
scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position
paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its
application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally
accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise
scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal
definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core
values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of
essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing
parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and
finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element
Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM
with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how
DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for
computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics
consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI
paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and
developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational
science.

*Donghyeon Joo,Helya Hosseini,Ramyad Hadidi,Bahar Asgari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于非结构化稀疏性的KV缓存压缩方法，可支持高达70%的稀疏度而不损失准确性或需要微调。通过系统探索剪枝策略，发现基于逐令牌幅度的剪枝对Key和Value缓存均有效，优于结构化剪枝方案。采用位图稀疏格式和自定义注意力内核，显著加速解码性能，压缩率可达45%，吞吐量提升2.23倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存大小是解码性能的主要瓶颈，尤其是在大上下文长度下内存开销高。本文旨在通过稀疏化压缩KV缓存，提升解码效率。

Method: 1. 系统探索剪枝策略，发现基于逐令牌幅度的剪枝对Key和Value缓存最有效。2. 采用位图稀疏格式和自定义注意力内核，支持任意稀疏模式的压缩计算。

Result: 1. 支持高达70%的稀疏度而不损失准确性。2. KV缓存压缩至45%，吞吐量提升2.23倍。3. 实现更长的上下文长度和更高的解码速度。

Conclusion: 非结构化稀疏性显著提升KV缓存压缩效率，结合自定义内核和位图格式，为LLM解码性能提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache
compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising
accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of
pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly
effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing
prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier
elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple
magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the
major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large
context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a
custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over
compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly
accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby
compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom
attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial
compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer
context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to
dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过参数或内存高效的方法提升大语言模型（LLM）预训练的效率，同时保持与全模型训练相当的性能。通过综述、基准评估和提出新技术（权重重构和动量重置），作者发现低秩方法结合高秩更新能显著提升性能，并在1B模型上实现了比现有方法更低的内存消耗和困惑度。

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）的预训练面临巨大的计算和内存挑战，现有方法（如LoRA）在微调中有效，但预训练中的应用仍不足。本文旨在探索高效预训练方法，缩小性能差距。

Method: 1. 综述现有高效预训练方法；2. 对代表性内存高效方法进行基准评估；3. 提出权重重构和动量重置技术，优化低秩方法。

Conclusion: 高效预训练方法可通过技术优化（如权重重构和动量重置）实现接近全模型训练的性能，同时显著减少资源消耗。

Abstract: Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple
domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with
some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is
accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the
memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous
approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While
these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training
is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.
Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can
parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while
achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the
performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are
the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that
summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform
a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training
approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We
observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank
training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that
incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving
their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely
weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of
efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to
the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular
memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using
about 25% less memory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战图扩散模型必须依赖显式噪声条件的假设，探索是否可以通过隐式推断噪声水平来简化模型设计。

Method: 提出基于伯努利边翻转损坏的理论框架，并扩展到结构-属性耦合噪声的复杂场景，通过GDSS和DiGress模型在合成和真实图数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 无条件GDMs性能与有条件模型相当或更优，同时参数减少4-6%，计算时间降低8-10%。

Conclusion: 图数据的高维特性本身为去噪提供了足够信息，为设计更简单高效的GDM架构提供了可能。

Abstract: Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the
effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we
challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly
infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially
eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a
theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it
to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute
noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph
datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our
theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance
comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering
reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results
suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes
sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler,
more efficient GDM architectures.

Motivation: DAG的节点可以有多种拓扑顺序，导致解码困难，需要一种原则性的方法来表示DAG。

Method: 将DAG视为在明确语法上的推导，生成唯一的产生式规则序列，相当于数据的无损压缩。

Result: 该方法可用于图生成、属性预测的潜在空间学习，以及结构化数据的贝叶斯优化。

Conclusion: 提出的语法方法为DAG提供了一种紧凑且等效的序列表示，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in
practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks,
and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it
remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of
a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a
grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent
sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as
derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique
sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a
description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a
representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph
generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the
sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured
data. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.

Conclusion: 安全约束的图演化为鲁棒且可解释的代理推理系统提供了可扩展、模块化的基础。

Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow
generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to
unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework
that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph
evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable
intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable
graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e.,
crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness
while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a
high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task
settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements
in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent
reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that
safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for
robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

Result: 在多种求解器中，EquiReg在线性和非线性图像恢复任务及偏微分方程重建中表现优于现有扩散模型。

Conclusion: EquiReg是一种有效的正则化框架，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems
such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based
inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling
process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However,
due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on
isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data
manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose
Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for
regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers.
EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and
penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new
distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that
exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold
samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling
process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms
state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image
restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K-means聚类可能因敏感变量（如性别或种族）导致某些子群在聚类中分布不均，引发公平性问题和社会偏见。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：先聚类，再调整部分数据点的聚类成员关系。提出两种高效算法，分别关注聚类外最近点和高度“混合”点。

Result: 在基准数据集上实验表明，公平性显著提升，聚类质量影响极小。

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松扩展到其他聚类算法或公平性指标，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major
weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have
disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in
terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue
may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to
improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization
formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small
subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are
proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with
one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on
highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial
improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The
proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering
algorithms or fairness metrics.

Method: 结合Echo State Network（ESN）和tokenizer提取补丁级表示，并通过知识蒸馏从高容量MLP-Mixer教师模型迁移知识到轻量级学生模型。

Result: 在多个HAR数据集上达到超过80%的准确率，计算成本仅为DeepConvLSTM的六分之一。

Conclusion: PatchEchoClassifier是一种适用于边缘计算的高效实时HAR解决方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop an energy-efficient classifier for time-series
data by introducing PatchEchoClassifier, a novel model that leverages a
reservoir-based mechanism known as the Echo State Network (ESN). The model is
designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor
signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To
train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that
transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight
reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while
significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier
requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared
to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest
that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and
energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法独立量化线性层，忽略了后续层的影响，导致模型输出分布与原模型不一致。

Method: YAQA结合Kronecker分解的Hessian近似和量化无关的舍入算法，适用于大规模LLM。

Result: YAQA将KL散度降低约30%，并在下游任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: YAQA通过全局优化量化过程，显著提升了量化模型的性能。

Abstract: The main goal of post-training quantization (PTQ) is to produced a compressed
model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as
possible. To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear
layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However,
this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing
it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet
Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses
Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect
to the \textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components:
Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably
computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent
rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical
guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically
reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\approx 30\%$ while
achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.

Result: 实验表明加性正则化常产生多解，而乘性正则化在特定情况下能减少解的模糊性。

Conclusion: 论文提供了λ的界限指导，并展示了正则化k-means算法在非理想聚类中的表现。

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Conclusion: 权重调制在低维流形上提供了一种有效且原则性的任务上下文处理方法。

Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as
possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this
is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by
injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters
themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as
serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn
weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.
Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we
optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To
accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as
the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric
movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects
a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for
a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.
First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a
convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.
Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging
generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several
topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.
noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their
simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks
by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.
These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds
offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了LLMs在谈判中的战略深度和对手感知能力。

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges
for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and
adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture
this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in
realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on
utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a
novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive
practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)
human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility
theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly
reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured
feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining
strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning
(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental
results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with
human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly
improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware
reasoning.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain
effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in
real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust
RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case
models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are
particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and
new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive
offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific
environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect
simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training,
but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO,
the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these
challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount
of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and
minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in
the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized
sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing
methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample
efficiency in offline robust RL.

Result: QLIP提升了LLaVA v1.5模型系列的视觉问答准确率，在V*基准上详细理解性能提升13.6%。

Conclusion: QLIP是一种高效且无需重新训练的CLIP替代方案，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode images into visual tokens,
aligning visual and textual signals within a shared latent space to facilitate
crossmodal representation learning. The CLIP model is a widely adopted
foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical
role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision
encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only
handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings
for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model
typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often
necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.
  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the
CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these
issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance
both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training.
QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform
grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental
results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering
accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without
requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts
detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by
up to 13.6 percent.

challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic
complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions.
Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation,
making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of
human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target
specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645
diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a
Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple
dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation
accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems,
such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval,
demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences.
Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment
and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation

TL;DR: 通过调整初始化率和权重衰减系数控制模型复杂度，可以提升大语言模型的扩展规律，并在不同模型和数据规模下表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索更基础的方法以可靠地增强大语言模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过调整初始化率和权重衰减系数来控制模型复杂度，并比较不同复杂度超参数下预训练模型的性能。

Result: 恒定初始化率（标准差的指数）使扩展规律在模型和数据规模上下降更快，显著提升了2.4B模型在1T标记上的性能。

Conclusion: 复杂度控制是大语言模型持续进步的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly
advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches
that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that
model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the
initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of
LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further
illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on
1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the
initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent
of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.
These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the
continual advancement of LLMs.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）在空间域学习节点特征，难以确保拓扑特征的显式提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种谱GNNs的性能，并增强了灵活性。

Conclusion: 双曲PDE范式不仅提高了消息传递的可解释性，还增强了拓扑特征的显式提取能力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage message passing mechanisms to learn the
topological features of graph data. Traditional GNNs learns node features in a
spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological
features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a
dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular
solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors
describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any
moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the
basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message
passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics
about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with
spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing
enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to
approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also
significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse
graph tasks.

Result: 实验表明，$K^2$VAE在短期和长期预测中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $K^2$VAE为长期概率时间序列预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in
decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and
transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while
overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
(LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have
a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models
inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model
that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear
dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model
uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in
long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF,
providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

Result: SCORPIO将系统吞吐量提升14.4倍，SLO达成率提高46.5%。

Conclusion: SCORPIO通过优化调度显著提升了LLM服务的SLO达成率和系统性能。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems prioritize maximum
throughput. They often neglect Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as Time to
First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT), which leads to suboptimal
SLO attainment. This paper introduces SCORPIO, an SLO-oriented LLM serving
system designed to maximize system goodput and SLO attainment for workloads
with heterogeneous SLOs. Our core insight is to exploit SLO heterogeneity for
adaptive scheduling across admission control, queue management, and batch
selection. SCORPIO features a TTFT Guard, which employs least-deadline-first
reordering and rejects unattainable requests, and a TPOT Guard, which utilizes
a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both
guards are supported by a predictive module. Evaluations demonstrate that
SCORPIO improves system goodput by up to 14.4X and SLO adherence by up to 46.5%
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language
representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for
adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt
learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains
underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral
differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning
(VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain
shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{}
and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and
prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL).
Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex
scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both
prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical
insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to
the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning.
Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the
power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the
scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on
point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for
real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining
the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional
computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on
Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation.
Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of
infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws,
allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both
the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such
as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable,
uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have inspired the development of

applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that
distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG
data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The
best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a
5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in
both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of
the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts.
These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process
real-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize
brain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric

Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from
incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios.
Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information,
such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume
that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place
significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of
large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a
trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal
information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns
and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal
reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective
imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by
6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927
correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法主要关注单个权重的重要性估计，导致模型关键能力难以保留，尤其是在半结构化稀疏约束下性能下降明显。

Method: 提出通过最小化归一化重要性分数的信息熵，将重要性集中在更小的权重子集上，并利用可学习的正交变换（DenoiseRotator）实现这一目标。

Conclusion: DenoiseRotator是一种模型无关的方法，能够与现有剪枝技术无缝集成，显著提升了剪枝后的模型性能。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急诊科的临床决策复杂且快速，CDRs的应用常因医生的认知负荷受限，因此需要一种自动化工具来辅助决策。

Method: 开发了CDR-Agent系统，基于非结构化临床笔记自动选择和应用CDRs，并通过合成和CDR-Bench数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: CDR-Agent能高效选择CDRs并优化决策，减少不必要的干预，适用于急诊科及其他临床环境。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly
in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions
are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools
that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to
make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the
clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply
the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system
designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying
the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate
CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although
CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\%
(synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM
baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces
computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent
not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective
imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully
identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM
prompting approaches. Code for our work can be found at:

Method: 提出DINGO，一种动态规划方法，用于并行预测块状令牌的扩散LLMs，确保输出严格满足约束且分布不变。

Result: 在符号数学和JSON生成基准测试中，DINGO比无约束推理提高了68个百分点。

Conclusion: DINGO为扩散LLMs提供了一种高效且分布保留的约束解码方法，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional
autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime
efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably
enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which
makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as
fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This
parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are
designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true
output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic
programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and
provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with
the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while
strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic
math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point
improvement over unconstrained inference

Result: CompFlow在多个动态偏移的RL基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CompFlow通过理论驱动的动态差距估计和主动数据收集策略，显著提升了强化学习在动态不一致环境中的性能。

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can
significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but
this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition
dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically
address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high
dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often
relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when
the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical
connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model
the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of
the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior.
This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization
for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics
gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions.
Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce
an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in
regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the
performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow
outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted
dynamics.

Abstract: Crop disease detection and classification is a critical challenge in
agriculture, with major implications for productivity, food security, and
environmental sustainability. While deep learning models such as CNN and ViT
have shown excellent performance in classifying plant diseases from images,
their large-scale deployment is often limited by data privacy concerns.
Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue, but centralized FL remains
vulnerable to single-point failures and scalability limits. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that uses
validation loss (Loss_val) both to guide model sharing between peers and to
correct local training via an adaptive loss function controlled by weighting
parameter. We conduct extensive experiments using PlantVillage datasets with
three deep learning architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT_B16), analyzing the
impact of weighting parameter, the number of shared models, the number of
clients, and the use of Loss_val versus Loss_train of other clients. Results
demonstrate that our DFL approach not only improves accuracy and convergence
speed, but also ensures better generalization and robustness across
heterogeneous data environments making it particularly well-suited for
privacy-preserving agricultural applications.

TL;DR: BOGC-MML是一种基于贝叶斯的多模态学习方法，通过建模梯度不确定性并校准更新方向，解决了现有方法中固定权重和维度平等处理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法通常以固定权重聚合梯度，忽视各模态梯度的内在不确定性，导致敏感维度过度更新或非敏感维度更新不足。

Method: 提出BOGC-MML方法，将各模态梯度建模为随机变量并推导其概率分布，通过证据量化梯度置信度，并使用Dempster-Shafer规则融合不确定性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效平衡敏感性和保守性，提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: BOGC-MML通过显式建模梯度不确定性，优化了多模态学习的更新方向，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to
improve predictive accuracy. However, existing methods mainly aggregate
gradients with fixed weights and treat all dimensions equally, overlooking the
intrinsic gradient uncertainty of each modality. This may lead to (i) excessive
updates in sensitive dimensions, degrading performance, and (ii) insufficient
updates in less sensitive dimensions, hindering learning. To address this
issue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for
MML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model
optimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each
modality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability
distribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we
propose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of
each gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the
confidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences,
we explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced
Dempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a
calibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across
dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining LSTM (Long Short-Term
Memory) networks with LightGBM and CatBoost for stock price prediction. The
framework processes time-series financial data and evaluates performance using
seven models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), vanilla LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and
standard Neural Networks (NNs). Key metrics, including MAE, R-squared, MSE, and
RMSE, are used to establish benchmarks across different time scales.
  Building on these benchmarks, we develop an ensemble model that combines the
strengths of sequential and tree-based approaches. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework improves accuracy by 10 to 15 percent compared to
individual models and reduces error during market changes. This study
highlights the potential of ensemble methods for financial forecasting and
provides a flexible design for integrating new machine learning techniques.

Conclusion: EST通过傅里叶变换的均匀采样策略保证了等变归纳偏置，显著提升了分子系统建模的表达能力和性能。

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced
molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their
message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are
limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations,
thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a
Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after
Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can
encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior
expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed
through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular
benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

TL;DR: MAP是一种新的参数高效微调框架，通过将权重矩阵分解为方向和大小，提供更灵活和可解释的适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）在方向定义上缺乏几何基础，限制了其性能和灵活性。

Method: MAP将预训练权重归一化，学习方向更新，并引入两个标量系数独立调整基向量和更新向量的大小。

Result: 实验表明，MAP显著提升了现有方法的性能，且易于集成。

Conclusion: MAP因其普适性和简洁性，有望成为未来参数高效微调方法的设计标准。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自适应变邻域搜索方法（RL-AVNS），用于高效解决多时间窗车辆路径问题（VRPMTW），显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应方法仅依赖历史操作性能，无法动态适应实时状态，因此需要一种更智能的方法来优化操作选择。

Method: 结合强化学习框架动态选择邻域操作，引入时间灵活性度量改进震荡阶段，并使用基于Transformer的策略网络指导局部搜索。

Result: 在无人售货机补货场景中，RL-AVNS在解质量和计算效率上显著优于传统VNS、AVNS及其他学习启发式方法，且能泛化至未见过的实例。

Conclusion: RL-AVNS在复杂物流场景中具有实际应用价值，尤其在泛化能力和效率方面表现突出。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive variable
neighborhood search (RL-AVNS) method designed for effectively solving the
Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Time Windows (VRPMTW). Unlike traditional
adaptive approaches that rely solely on historical operator performance, our
method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select
neighborhood operators based on real-time solution states and learned
experience. We introduce a fitness metric that quantifies customers' temporal
flexibility to improve the shaking phase, and employ a transformer-based neural
policy network to intelligently guide operator selection during the local
search. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on realistic
scenarios derived from the replenishment of unmanned vending machines,
characterized by multiple clustered replenishment windows. Results demonstrate
that RL-AVNS significantly outperforms traditional variable neighborhood search
(VNS), adaptive VNS (AVNS), and state-of-the-art learning-based heuristics,
achieving substantial improvements in solution quality and computational
efficiency across various instance scales and time window complexities.
Particularly notable is the algorithm's capability to generalize effectively to
problem instances not encountered during training, underscoring its practical
utility for complex logistics scenarios.

Motivation: 完全微调大规模基础模型计算成本高昂，而现有的参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）的机制尚不明确，因此需要深入研究微调过程中权重矩阵的结构变化。

Method: 通过奇异值分解（SVD）分析权重矩阵的结构变化，发现任务特定知识集中在顶部奇异值方向，并提出一种可学习缩放顶部奇异方向的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个任务中均优于基线模型，验证了基于结构信息的微调方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 任务特定知识主要通过低维子空间注入模型，基于结构信息的微调方法能够在不破坏全局结构的情况下优化模型性能。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across
a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models
incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces
low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the
structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through
singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly
amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact,
suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional
subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are
reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace
remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that
leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise
modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global
structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines
across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: LUMION是一种新型可重构光织物，用于在数据中心机架内连接加速器，动态整合备用加速器以应对故障，避免低效的整机架迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ML数据中心中，加速器故障时需迁移整个作业到新机架，效率低下且需预留大量空闲资源。

Method: 提出LUMION光织物，动态整合备用加速器，避免整机架迁移，并构建硬件原型验证。

Result: 实验显示，LUMION能在1秒内替换故障GPU并恢复作业，带宽提升近2倍，微调吞吐量显著提高。

Conclusion: LUMION显著提升了资源利用率和性能，为ML数据中心故障恢复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the
affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach,
while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring
datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In
this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a
novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a
datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically
integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby
maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the
benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our
experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a
healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION
achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks
after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X
improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains
such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely
untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a
compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators
that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs --
a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this
work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator
architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO)
in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear
attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable
kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space.
As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store
large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling
spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across
diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable,
and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are

Motivation: 传统模型难以区分内源和外源变量，导致效率低下和过拟合问题。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上的实验表明，CrossLinear在短期和长期预测任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 交叉相关嵌入模块有效且通用，可作为插件应用于不同领域的预测任务。

Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging
paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between
variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between
endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting.
In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model
that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play
cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the
dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly
integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures
time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying
or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in
dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements.
Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head
to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies,
further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12
real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance
in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study
underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module.
Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in
for various forecasting tasks across different domains. Codes are available at

<details>

Motivation: 在大规模训练时代，模型合并成为高效创建多任务模型的工具，但现有方法假设权重矩阵中相同位置的条目功能相同，忽略了微调后神经网络的复杂性。

Method: DRM利用奇异值分解将权重矩阵分解并协调到对齐的联合空间中，使条目级合并成为可能，并通过重归一化优化合并效果。

Result: 实验表明，DRM在多种模型（如ViT、DeBERTa、T5和Llama3.1-8B）上优于现有合并方法，尤其在完全微调和低秩适应设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: DRM通过重归一化创建了稳健的联合空间，显著提升了模型合并的性能，为多任务学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for
creating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to
be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional
multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at
identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling
straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption
overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may
develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging
problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective
approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and
coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise
merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various
settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa,
encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B.
Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art
merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.
Moreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for
creating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing
to the method's performance.

Result: 实验表明，Doppler在减少系统执行时间和每轮训练时间方面优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: Doppler通过结合专家启发式和强化学习，显著提升了设备利用率和任务执行效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning operations in a dataflow graph to devices
to minimize execution time in a work-conserving system, with emphasis on
complex machine learning workloads. Prior learning-based methods often struggle
due to three key limitations: (1) reliance on bulk-synchronous systems like
TensorFlow, which under-utilize devices due to barrier synchronization; (2)
lack of awareness of the scheduling mechanism of underlying systems when
designing learning-based methods; and (3) exclusive dependence on reinforcement
learning, ignoring the structure of effective heuristics designed by experts.
In this paper, we propose \textsc{Doppler}, a three-stage framework for
training dual-policy networks consisting of 1) a $\mathsf{SEL}$ policy for
selecting operations and 2) a $\mathsf{PLC}$ policy for placing chosen
operations on devices. Our experiments show that \textsc{Doppler} outperforms
all baseline methods across tasks by reducing system execution time and
additionally demonstrates sampling efficiency by reducing per-episode training
time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software
development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging
and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly
generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment --
offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs'
benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current
benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In
this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a
high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code,
specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina
consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem
descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive
test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof
generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in
verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4%
correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful
proofs, with one trial per task. We hope Verina will catalyze progress in
verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large
models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in
value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by
small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL
sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference
brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online
training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of
single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of
high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on
learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online
RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach
on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high
degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that,
despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single
and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

Conclusion: LUCB-H算法能有效结合离线数据，并在不同场景下表现出色，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased
offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in
real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result
for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between
online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H
algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an
auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB
framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity
of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms
it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower
bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in
effectively incorporating offline data.

Conclusion: PMDG为单源域泛化（SDG）提供了一种实用解决方案，为未来域泛化研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this
challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical
application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated
with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose
Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that
enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical
Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be
used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with
PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze
the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our
analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between
MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed
actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive
empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain
generalization. Our code is available at

Abstract: To improve the training efficiency of federated learning (FL), previous
research has employed low-rank decomposition techniques to reduce communication
overhead. In this paper, we seek to enhance the performance of these low-rank
decomposition methods. Specifically, we focus on three key issues related to
decomposition in FL: what to decompose, how to decompose, and how to aggregate.
Subsequently, we introduce three novel techniques: Model Update Decomposition
(MUD), Block-wise Kronecker Decomposition (BKD), and Aggregation-Aware
Decomposition (AAD), each targeting a specific issue. These techniques are
complementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance.
Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the
convergence of the proposed MUD. Extensive experimental results show that our
approach achieves faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to relevant
baseline methods. The code is available at

*Tian Tian,Chunyan Miao,Hangwei Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对时间序列分类任务的频率域增强方法（FreRA），通过分离关键和非关键频率成分，保护语义信息并提升对比学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列增强方法主要从视觉领域借鉴，可能引入不匹配模式，破坏语义信息。频率域视角提供了全局性、独立性和紧凑性优势。

Method: 提出FreRA方法，自动分离关键和非关键频率成分，分别进行语义感知的身份修改和语义无关的自适应修改。

Result: FreRA在多个基准数据集上优于10种基线方法，在分类、异常检测和迁移学习任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FreRA是一种轻量级且有效的时间序列对比学习增强方法，能够保护语义信息并提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize
the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency
Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on
classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive
learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA
automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.
Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and
semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant
information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the
unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates
semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale
datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading
baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer
learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive
representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios
across diverse datasets.

*Srijith Nair,Michael Lin,Amirreza Talebi,Peizhong Ju,Elizabeth Bentley,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSL-SAGE是一种新的联邦分割学习算法，通过辅助模型估计服务器端梯度反馈，显著降低通信成本和客户端内存需求，同时保持与FedAvg相当的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习（FL）和分割学习（SL）的局限性：FL要求客户端训练完整模型，不适合大规模模型；SL虽然减轻了客户端内存压力，但增加了网络延迟。现有方法缺乏服务器反馈且可能影响准确性。

Method: 提出FSL-SAGE算法，利用辅助模型周期性适应本地数据集以模拟服务器行为，估计服务器端梯度反馈。

Result: FSL-SAGE达到与FedAvg相同的收敛速度（O(1/√T)），同时显著降低通信成本和客户端内存需求，并在实验中优于现有FSL方法。

Conclusion: FSL-SAGE在通信效率和准确性上均优于现有方法，为分布式机器学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split
Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data.
However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for
large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory
constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases
network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the
conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to
improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor
accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation
Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates
server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models
periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that
FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is
the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while
significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our
empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL
methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RadarGate的新型门控方法，通过旋转操作增强LoRA表示的表达能力，解决了传统门控机制在扩展性上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统门控机制在路由输入到最佳专家时限制了LLM的扩展性，导致泛化能力差和欠拟合问题。现有加权和机制的表达能力不足是根本原因。

Method: 提出RadarGate，通过旋转操作增强LoRA表示的交互能力，包括学习组件融合LoRA表示和旋转矩阵定义角度关系。

Result: 在6个公共基准测试的21个任务中验证了RadarGate的有效性，解决了LoRA数量增加时的泛化和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: RadarGate通过几何变换提升了LoRA表示的交互能力，为扩展LLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) facilitates
large language models (LLMs) to efficiently adapt to diverse tasks. However,
traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may
fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and
underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted
expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the
convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a
novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational
operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate
richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs.
Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a
learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix
involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship
between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an
extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and
properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues
as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks
across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We
also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of
representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically
similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing
distance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IM-MPNN的新架构，通过多尺度图表示解决MPNN中长程依赖捕捉不足的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNN在处理图数据时存在长程依赖捕捉不足的问题，类似于CNN中的有效感受野（ERF）问题。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出IM-MPNN架构，通过分层图粗化实现多尺度消息传递，增强长程交互能力。

Result: 在LRGB等基准测试中，IM-MPNN显著优于基线MPNN，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: IM-MPNN有效解决了MPNN的长程依赖问题，为图数据处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for
processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is
often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range
dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the
MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive
Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical
receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and
theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired
by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved
Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address
these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of
the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and
facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or
parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the
Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LoRA（低秩适应）中非零初始化对微调动态的影响，发现非零初始化能提升鲁棒性，且不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA层中矩阵初始化为零缺乏理论支持，本文探讨非零初始化的影响。

Method: 从无限宽度角度分析非零初始化对LoRA微调动态的影响。

Result: 非零初始化提升了对次优学习率的鲁棒性，且不影响微调性能。

Conclusion: 微调无需严格从预训练模型开始，非零初始化可行且有效。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is
initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained
model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's
fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals
that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$
to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates,
particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the
non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained
weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words,
fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The
validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across
various models and datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化剪枝方法，用于优化时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的微调过程，使其在目标任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TSFMs在零样本预测中表现优异，但在微调后仍无法稳定超越小型专用模型，因此需要研究如何有效适应目标任务。

Method: 通过结构化剪枝方法，保留预训练模型中的任务相关子结构，并在更紧凑的参数空间中进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，剪枝后的TSFMs微调性能显著提升，甚至超越专用基线模型。

Conclusion: “剪枝后微调”范式能够帮助TSFMs实现最优性能，并超越专用模型。

Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models
(TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot
forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot
consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot
downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs
for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the
pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in
computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant
network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve
this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to
regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant
and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six
benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly
improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This
"prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

*Xingyuan Pan,Chenlu Ye,Joseph Melkonian,Jiaqi W. Ma,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Daunce是一种通过不确定性估计实现数据归属的简单有效方法，适用于大规模语言模型，并在准确性和可扩展性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度基TDA方法受限于计算复杂性和可扩展性，而随机投影方法虽提升可扩展性但牺牲准确性。Daunce通过不确定性估计解决了这一问题。

Method: 通过微调一组扰动模型并计算损失协方差作为归属分数，Daunce实现了高效且准确的数据归属。

Result: Daunce在视觉任务和LLM微调中表现优异，并首次实现了对专有LLM（如GPT）的数据归属。

Conclusion: Daunce是一种可扩展且准确的TDA方法，适用于黑盒模型，为数据调试和估值提供了新工具。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to identify which training
examples influence a model's predictions on specific test data most. By
quantifying these influences, TDA supports critical applications such as data
debugging, curation, and valuation. Gradient-based TDA methods rely on
gradients and second-order information, limiting their applicability at scale.
While recent random projection-based methods improve scalability, they often
suffer from degraded attribution accuracy. Motivated by connections between
uncertainty and influence functions, we introduce Daunce - a simple yet
effective data attribution approach through uncertainty estimation. Our method
operates by fine-tuning a collection of perturbed models and computing the
covariance of per-example losses across these models as the attribution score.
Daunce is scalable to large language models (LLMs) and achieves more accurate
attribution compared to existing TDA methods. We validate Daunce on tasks
ranging from vision tasks to LLM fine-tuning, and further demonstrate its
compatibility with black-box model access. Applied to OpenAI's GPT models, our
method achieves, to our knowledge, the first instance of data attribution on
proprietary LLMs.

Result: ε-VCP随模型过拟合增加，可作为量化过拟合的实用指标。

Conclusion: 泛化能力与反事实可解释性存在固有权衡，ε-VCP为量化过拟合提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between model generalization
and counterfactual explainability in supervised learning. We introduce the
notion of $\varepsilon$-valid counterfactual probability ($\varepsilon$-VCP) --
the probability of finding perturbations of a data point within its
$\varepsilon$-neighborhood that result in a label change. We provide a
theoretical analysis of $\varepsilon$-VCP in relation to the geometry of the
model's decision boundary, showing that $\varepsilon$-VCP tends to increase
with model overfitting. Our findings establish a rigorous connection between
poor generalization and the ease of counterfactual generation, revealing an
inherent trade-off between generalization and counterfactual explainability.
Empirical results validate our theory, suggesting $\varepsilon$-VCP as a
practical proxy for quantitatively characterizing overfitting.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了特征与标签之间的非线性关联问题，并在实验中表现出优越性。

Abstract: The rapid growth in feature dimension may introduce implicit associations
between features and labels in multi-label datasets, making the relationships
between features and labels increasingly complex. Moreover, existing methods
often adopt low-dimensional linear decomposition to explore the associations
between features and labels. However, linear decomposition struggles to capture
complex nonlinear associations and may lead to misalignment between the feature
space and the label space. To address these two critical challenges, we propose
innovative solutions. First, we design a random walk graph that integrates
feature-feature, label-label, and feature-label relationships to accurately
capture nonlinear and implicit indirect associations, while optimizing the
latent representations of associations between features and labels after
low-rank decomposition. Second, we align the variable spaces by leveraging
low-dimensional representation coefficients, while preserving the manifold
structure between the original high-dimensional multi-label data and the
low-dimensional representation space. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on seven benchmark datasets and three representative datasets
using various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method\footnote{Code: https://github.com/Heilong623/-GRW-}.

Method: 在涉及高斯控制噪声和二次控制成本的MDP家族中，比较随机和确定性策略的梯度、自然梯度和状态值函数，并构建等效的确定性MDP。

Result: 发现随机和确定性策略的梯度、自然梯度和状态值函数相同，但状态-控制值函数不同。提出了一种构建等效确定性MDP的方法。

Conclusion: 通过近似状态值函数而非状态-控制值函数，可以统一策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic
and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In
a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic
control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients,
natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the
state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general
procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent
to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the
sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results
suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state
value functions rather than state-control value functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化联邦学习中，由于缺乏中央服务器和存在多个全局模型，现有的贡献测量方法无法直接应用，因此需要开发新的方法。

Method: 提出了DFL-Shapley（基于Shapley值的扩展）和DFL-MR（一种可计算的近似方法），用于测量DFL中的参与者贡献。

Result: 实验证明DFL-Shapley是有效的基准指标，而DFL-MR能够接近DFL-Shapley的性能，适用于实际系统。

Conclusion: DFL-Shapley和DFL-MR为去中心化联邦学习提供了有效的贡献测量工具，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is
crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various
methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed
exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server
collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their
contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which
clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained
significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating
a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement
methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and
the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies
for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley,
an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used
CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the
ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable
approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise
Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios
and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm
DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity
to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as
contribution metrics in DFL.

Result: 实验表明，改进后的GRPOVI算法显著提升了RLHF训练效率。

Conclusion: 奖励调整模型和GRPOVI算法为RLHF训练提供了更高效的解决方案，并解释了规则奖励在GRPO中的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique
for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values
and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach,
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many
LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a
challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial
policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we
propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by
provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences
and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a
nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To
overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$
algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by
explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an
important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into
the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance
increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we
provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with
rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment
results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the
RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: 本文提出的外积结构为扩散Fisher信息的高效计算提供了新思路，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the
second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian
of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis.
However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by
applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box
method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is
time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually
resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data.
Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation
algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF,
respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with
time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the
approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in
likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior
accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms.
Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the
first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of
the general PF-ODE deduced map.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于生成模型的CI测试提供了新的方向，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random
variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and
statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative
model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial
networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional
distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To
address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based
generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong
testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching
scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics
conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type
I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method
to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We
theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by
score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a
promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.

Motivation: 传统BNCs学习方法性能不如随机森林等领先分类方法，而HDPs平滑技术虽能提升性能，但灵活性不足且计算复杂。

Method: 使用对数线性回归近似HDPs的行为，作为线性模型，方法灵活且易于解释。

Conclusion: 新方法为BNCs提供了一种高效、灵活的替代方案，性能与随机森林相当，同时保持了BNCs的可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable
for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and
offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have
historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods
such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using
hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve
performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these
techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized
sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter
estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of
HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to
interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our
experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being
orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on
categorical data.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving
serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model
development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple
accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are
larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow
Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more
domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be
extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our
methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower
serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary
datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests
within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric.
We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve
relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA
benchmark.

Result: GraphPAE在异质性节点分类、图属性预测和迁移学习等任务中表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphPAE通过双路径设计有效捕捉了多样频率信息，提升了图自监督学习的表达能力。

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations
without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders
(GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability.
Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements,
such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation
reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture
low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural
information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders
(GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node
features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding
to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict
the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node
representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby
enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct
extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including
heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer
learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art
performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

TL;DR: 论文提出Sentinel框架，通过主动异常检测优化直播流调度，显著减少异常频率并提高收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着直播服务的快速增长，CCPs在满足需求方面日益重要，但现有调度策略因异常问题难以实用化。

Method: Sentinel采用两阶段调度范式（预调度和后调度），预调度阶段检测异常并构建策略池，后调度阶段根据请求触发合适策略。

Result: 实验显示，Sentinel减少异常频率70%，收入提升74%，调度速度翻倍。

Conclusion: Sentinel通过主动异常检测有效优化CCPs调度，显著提升性能和收益。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge
service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting
the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in
optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve
practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the
substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in
time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel
models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in
the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a
strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers
an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the
scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that
Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by
74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

Abstract: Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards
are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect
the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively
define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward
unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward
fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing
for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model
preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as
resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and
fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization
and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods
in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness
reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these
scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a
more fair manner.

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects
crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received
increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including
limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.
Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's
learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,
interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may
face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to
explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with
imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three
representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate
control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how
input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between
them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural
network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under
limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the
three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse
environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating
imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL
agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping
and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,
achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast,
reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive
to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the
importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect
inputs.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in
speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are
commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally
expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a
production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and
explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance
models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using
pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large
longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting
time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly
associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning
approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional
mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest
performance.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing
next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond
era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based
techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments.
With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand
for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly
being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not
assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this
paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss
models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the
model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We
evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full
interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing
two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic
and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep
Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover,
on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform
traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors,
offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the
efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

Conclusion: 后验OOD检测方法为高效且隐私保护的开放世界类增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

Result: bPC在生成或判别任务中表现优于单向模型，并在多模态学习和缺失信息推理任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: bPC更接近生物视觉推理，为理解大脑视觉处理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual
learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down
generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and
inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that
PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict
neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence
suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference,
while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring
bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC
model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while
maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC
matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or
discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously
suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two
biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with
missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference
more closely.

Abstract: In China's competitive fresh e-commerce market, optimizing operational
strategies, especially inventory management in front-end warehouses, is key to
enhance customer satisfaction and to gain a competitive edge. Front-end
warehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of
fresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of
deciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account
capacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize
(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align
prediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer
satisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task
Optimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes
product selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer
satisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs
a 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal
inventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking
model PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a
post-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh
platform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO
method. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances
the full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and
narrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These
findings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at
front-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable
insights for future research in this domain.

TL;DR: DACER2通过引入Q梯度场目标和时间加权机制，显著提升了扩散模型在在线RL中的训练和推理效率，同时保持或增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在在线RL中表现优异，但传统方法需要大量扩散步骤，导致效率低下，直接减少步骤又会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Q梯度场目标作为辅助优化目标，并引入时间加权机制，以在不同扩散阶段优化去噪过程。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试和多模态任务中，DACER2仅需五步扩散即达到最优性能，且多模态表现优于DACER。

Conclusion: DACER2通过高效优化策略，解决了扩散模型在在线RL中的效率瓶颈，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise
in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy
Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse
diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy
gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost
of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training
efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance
degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant
bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To
improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing
performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary
optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step.
Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the
diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy.
To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the
model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine
actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and
several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five
diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to
DACER.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用头部运动单元（kinemes）作为抑郁症严重程度评估的生物标志物，并通过多数据集验证其有效性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症对全球数百万人造成负面影响，而头部运动在自动化抑郁症评估中尚未得到充分研究。同时，单一数据集验证机器学习模型可能限制其泛化性。

Method: 研究使用三种西方文化背景的抑郁症数据集（德国AVEC2013、澳大利亚Blackdog和美国Pitt），通过两种方法验证kineme模式的泛化性：(i) 单/多数据集的k折交叉验证，(ii) 模型在其他数据集上的重用。

Result: 头部运动模式是评估抑郁症严重程度的有效生物标志物，在分类和回归任务中表现优异，并在AVEC2013数据集中取得第二低的MAE。此外，kineme特征在二元分类和回归任务中比其他视觉行为线索更具泛化性。

Conclusion: 头部运动单元（kinemes）是抑郁症严重程度评估的高效且泛化性强的生物标志物，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Depression is a debilitating mood disorder negatively impacting millions
worldwide. While researchers have explored multiple verbal and non-verbal
behavioural cues for automated depression assessment, head motion has received
little attention thus far. Further, the common practice of validating machine
learning models via a single dataset can limit model generalisability. This
work examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising
elementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity
estimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different
western cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt
datasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the
generalisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold
cross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on
other datasets. Evaluating classification and regression performance with
classical machine learning methods, our results show that: (1) head motion
patterns are efficient biomarkers for estimating depression severity, achieving
highly competitive performance for both classification and regression tasks on
a variety of datasets, including achieving the second best Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) on the AVEC2013 dataset, and (2) kineme-based features are more
generalisable than (a) raw head motion descriptors for binary severity
classification, and (b) other visual behavioural cues for severity estimation
(regression).

Method: 提出了一种基于令牌级多样性的方法，并将其转化为实际目标，选择性地应用于正样本。

Result: 在12个LLM上的评估显示，多样性与推理潜力正相关；该方法在数学推理基准上平均提升3.5%。

Conclusion: 多样性感知策略优化能显著提升LLM的推理能力，并生成更多样且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced
rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired
a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on
LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work
presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based
training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy
optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong
positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel
metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models.
This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL
training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it
into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples.
Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5
percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

Result: 通过理论证明了最优弃权策略，开发了模型无关的算法，并在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为排序任务中的弃权提供了理论和实践支持，展示了在高风险领域中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Ranking systems influence decision-making in high-stakes domains like health,
education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social
impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such
mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making
system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While
abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification
tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in
pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the
ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the
estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold:
a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a
model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models,
and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 提出SPR正则化方法，基于秩的选择性稀疏性，选择性惩罚嵌入向量中的显著特征组件。

Result: 实验表明，SPR优于其他正则化方法，能显著提升KGC模型的性能。

Conclusion: 精心设计的正则化方法不仅能缓解过拟合，还能突破模型性能上限，SPR方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Motivation: 研究战略分类中非线性分类器的表现及其对学习的影响，填补现有研究主要集中在线性分类器的空白。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，分析非线性对决策边界点、分类器表达能力及模型类复杂性的影响。

Result: 发现通用逼近器（如神经网络）在战略环境中不再通用，并通过实验展示了性能差距。

Conclusion: 非线性分类器在战略环境中表现受限，需重新考虑模型设计。

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is
extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly
feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning
supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification
has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to
expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under
non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up
approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier
expressivity, and model classes complexity. A key finding is that universal
approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment
is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps
even on an unrestricted model class.

Motivation: 在现实场景中，意外输入不可避免，OOD检测和不确定性估计对构建安全的机器学习系统至关重要。

Method: 通过引入一个“垃圾”类，初始填充高斯噪声表示异常输入，结合网络反演和迭代训练优化分类器。

Result: 模型能有效检测并拒绝OOD样本，同时提供预测的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部OOD数据集或后校准技术，为OOD检测和不确定性估计提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

Result: 在离线RL任务中，增加引导权重可稳定提升性能，且能泛化简单监督方法（如目标条件行为克隆）。

Conclusion: CFGRL框架以监督学习的简单性实现性能提升，为离线RL任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the
performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously
tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably
scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by
deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion
models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of
supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On
offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting
leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate
without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple
supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further
prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.

Conclusion: FedPG和b-RS-FedPG在异构环境下表现优异，为联邦强化学习提供了有效的收敛性解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement
learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In
this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively,
can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying,
even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results
for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under
a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both
entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical
analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of
agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights
from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient
method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization
coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate
explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary
policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG
consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序化弱监督（PWS）通过标注函数减少人工标注工作量，但LF的准确性直接影响标签质量。本文旨在通过少量标注数据修复LF。

Method: 将LF建模为条件规则，选择性修改其输出以满足两个条件：为每个标注数据提供足够证据，并确保修复后的LF准确性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能基于极少量标注数据显著提升LF质量。

Conclusion: 通过修复LF，可以高效提升程序化弱监督的标签质量，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for
labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions
(LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels
depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem
of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we
develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their
results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there
is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii)
the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as
conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change
their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system
improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled
datapoints.

Motivation: 研究SGD在固定学习率下的行为，揭示其隐含的自由能最小化机制，以解释不同学习率对训练收敛性的影响。

Method: 通过热力学框架，将SGD行为建模为自由能最小化（F=U-TS），并实验验证了该框架在欠参数化和过参数化模型中的适用性。

Result: 欠参数化模型遵循自由能最小化，温度随学习率单调增加；过参数化模型在低学习率下温度趋近零，SGD直接最小化损失。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了SGD行为的物理本质，为理解学习率对训练的影响提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic interpretation of the stationary behavior of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under fixed learning rates (LRs) in neural
network training. We show that SGD implicitly minimizes a free energy function
$F=U-TS$, balancing training loss $U$ and the entropy of the weights
distribution $S$, with temperature $T$ determined by the LR. This perspective
offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss
minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We
empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP)
and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy
minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP
models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to
minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this
mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients
near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.

Conclusion: 论文为复杂学习环境中的认知误差提供了理论框架和实用工具，扩展了对负迁移的理解。

Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic
uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify
the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings
introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the
basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple
tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the
source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an
accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce
a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,
decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)
consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of
epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each
of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries
of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the
settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within
$\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization
bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and
validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.

Result: 结果表明高模型偏差会误导认知不确定性估计，现有方法倾向于将偏差引起的错误归为偶然性不确定性。

Conclusion: 结论强调只有在充分表示所有认知不确定性来源时，才能获得有意义的偶然性估计。

Abstract: In recent years various supervised learning methods that disentangle
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on second-order distributions have
been proposed. We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components
of epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of
model bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of
epistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the
classical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be
decomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a
simulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty
due to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate
that current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty.
Through theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model
bias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and
common second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur
bias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting
epistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric
estimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty
are properly represented.

Result: 在128k文本长度下，速度提升1.44倍，同时保持更高召回率。

Conclusion: AnchorAttention通过细粒度稀疏策略，显著优化了长上下文LLM的计算性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant
computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ
dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,
their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture
global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent
internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,
dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical
attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global
contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention
comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation},
leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set
of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe
Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the
anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a
stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation},
replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with
simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while
preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained
sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at
the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to
previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a
speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.

Result: 理论速度提升2倍（针对大集群慢节点场景），8-GPU服务器上实现22%的速度提升。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for
training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to
synchronize gradients or activations. However, bulk-synchronous AllReduce
algorithms can be delayed by a persistent straggler that is slower to reach the
synchronization barrier required to begin the collective. To address this
challenge, we propose StragglAR: an AllReduce algorithm that accelerates
distributed training and inference in the presence of persistent stragglers.
StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the
straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to
complete the AllReduce once the straggler reaches the synchronization barrier.
StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient
AllReduce algorithms (e.g., Ring) for large GPU clusters with persistent
stragglers. On an 8-GPU server, our implementation of StragglAR yields a 22%
speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

*Raj Ghugare,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于归一化流（NFs）的强化学习架构，解决了现有模型（如扩散模型和自回归变换器）的计算复杂性和表达限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习模型（如扩散模型和自回归变换器）存在计算复杂或表达受限的问题，而NFs被认为缺乏足够的表达能力。论文旨在证明NFs在RL中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种单一的NF架构，可无缝集成到RL算法中，作为策略、Q函数和占用度量。

Result: 该方法简化了算法，并在模仿学习、离线RL、目标条件RL和无监督RL中取得了更高的性能。

Conclusion: NFs在RL中具有显著潜力，能够提供高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using
powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and
diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay
the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion
models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance
on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are
scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing
flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they
enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or
autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received
limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows
lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on
recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates
seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy
measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher
performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and
unsupervised RL.

Conclusion: 研究为医疗诊断中的模型公平性提供了重要见解，并展示了不同缓解策略的适用性，强调了公平性与性能的权衡在医疗应用中的重要性。

Abstract: The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine
learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases
associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the
influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are
investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in
the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most
appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies
is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the
trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the
equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic
applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to
age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed
mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across
the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and
gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,
respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI
versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial
debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic
mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD
neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics,
influence model fairness.

Conclusion: 研究强调了对比对分布设计的重要性，为自监督图表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine
learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into
low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used
in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we
propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our
approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps
subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input
subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled
distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the
Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the
similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive
learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of
SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the
generated contrastive pairs.

Motivation: 当前最优的张量网络结构搜索（TN-SS）方法计算成本高且忽略领域信息，缺乏对结构的透明解释。

Method: 提出tnLLM框架，通过领域感知提示管道利用LLMs推理能力预测合适的TN结构，并结合领域信息优化目标函数。

Result: 实验表明，tnLLM在较少的函数评估次数下达到与最优方法相当的TN-SS目标函数值，并能加速其他方法的收敛。

Conclusion: tnLLM框架有效解决了TN-SS问题，结合领域信息和LLMs推理能力，显著提升了效率和解释性。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

Conclusion: 自适应联邦LoRA策略在理论和实践中均表现出高效性，为分布式设备上的LLM微调提供了优化方案。

Abstract: Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the
number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately
overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data
heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency,
particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the
convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and
communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for
federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without
requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an
adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client
resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we
formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the
LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock
convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to
approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to
state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法在优势估计粒度上存在不足，token级方法估计不准确，轨迹级方法信用分配不精确，SPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SPO采用分段级优势估计，包括灵活分段划分、精确分段优势估计和基于分段优势的策略优化（含概率掩码策略）。

Result: SPO在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上分别实现了6-12和7-11个百分点的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SPO通过中间粒度优势估计，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力，并在多个场景中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces
the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements
over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code
publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Result: RP-GSSM在非线性随机动力学学习任务中表现优于其他方法，尤其是在视频数据中。

Conclusion: RP-GSSM是一种适用于多种下游任务的基础模型，具有高效性和表达性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.

Result: 实验表明PIR能有效减少实例级误差，显著提升预测可靠性。

Conclusion: PIR为时间序列预测中的实例级问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications
and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods
have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases
and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a
significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts,
missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for
specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address
this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance
forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.
Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating
their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using
contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from
both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models
demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and
significantly improves forecasting reliability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language
models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training
instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency
due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal
reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is

Abstract: This paper explores second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning
(FL), addressing the critical challenges of slow convergence and the excessive
communication rounds required to achieve optimal performance from the global
model. While existing surveys in FL primarily focus on challenges related to
statistical and device label heterogeneity, as well as privacy and security
concerns in first-order FL methods, less attention has been given to the issue
of slow model training. This slow training often leads to the need for
excessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly
when data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine
various FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the
training process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art
second-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence
speed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and
generalization of the global model. Our findings show the potential of
incorporating Hessian curvature through second-order optimization into FL and
highlight key challenges, such as the efficient utilization of Hessian and its
inverse in FL. This work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at
developing scalable and efficient federated optimization methods for improving
the training of the global model in FL.

Abstract: Post-training of foundation language models has emerged as a promising
research domain in federated learning (FL) with the goal to enable
privacy-preserving model improvements and adaptations to user's downstream
tasks. Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches
that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access
to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models
has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL
raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL
contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and
autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box
models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various
aspects of openness and their implications for FL.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition.
Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we
compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as
noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks
obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers,
and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the
concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not
observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating
strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate
reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct
performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss
the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing
for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose
measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for
detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and
interpretability issues for automated software systems.

Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying
sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for
domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on
graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional
data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this
body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across
dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in
a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent
large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We
instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the
necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design
principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support
our findings.

Result: Muddit在质量和效率上优于更大的自回归模型。

Conclusion: 离散扩散结合视觉先验是统一生成任务的可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power grids to smart grids, significant
increase in the use of renewable energy sources, and soaring electricity prices
has triggered a digital transformation of the energy infrastructure that
enables new, data driven, applications often supported by machine learning
models. However, the majority of the developed machine learning models rely on
univariate data. To date, a structured study considering the role meta-data and
additional measurements resulting in multivariate data is missing. In this
paper we propose a taxonomy that identifies and structures various types of
data related to energy applications. The taxonomy can be used to guide
application specific data model development for training machine learning
models. Focusing on a household electricity forecasting application, we
validate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy in guiding the selection of
the features for various types of models. As such, we study of the effect of
domain, contextual and behavioral features on the forecasting accuracy of four
interpretable machine learning techniques and three openly available datasets.
Finally, using a feature importance techniques, we explain individual feature
contributions to the forecasting accuracy.

Result: 实验证明该方法具有更高的表达能力，同时计算效率得到优化。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩展了Skew Spectrum的功能，还为复杂图结构的嵌入提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings,
generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor & Borgwardt (2008). Grounded
in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of
graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer
graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and
hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization
further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between
computational complexity and expressivity. By applying
generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew
Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the
invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness
through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.

Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial
intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control
in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time
objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general
framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range
of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and
image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both
performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a
principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion
models. Project page at diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io.

Motivation: 尽管DPO在实证中表现良好，但其对数比率奖励参数化的理论依据尚不完整。本文旨在填补这一空白，并通过DID提供一个统一的理论视角。

Method: 利用差分信息分布（DID），分析偏好标签如何编码从参考策略到目标策略的差分信息，推导出DPO对数比率奖励的唯一最优形式，并研究熵对策略行为的影响。

Result: 研究发现，偏好标签编码差分信息的条件与对数边际有序策略的隐含假设相关；低熵差分信息强化策略分布，高熵差分信息则平滑策略分布。

Conclusion: 本文为DPO目标、偏好数据结构和策略行为提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了差分信息熵在指令跟随和知识密集型任务中的不同作用。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

Result: 在15个公共回归基准测试中，DLNs表现优于或与现代神经网络和经典回归基线相当，同时保持可解释性和快速推理。

Conclusion: DLNs是回归任务中一种可行且经济高效的替代方案，特别适用于需要模型透明度和计算效率的场景。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) achieve outstanding performance in many domains;
however, their decision processes are often opaque and their inference can be
computationally expensive in resource-constrained environments. We recently
proposed Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to address these issues for
tabular classification based on relaxing discrete logic into a differentiable
form, thereby enabling gradient-based learning of networks built from binary
logic operations. DLNs offer interpretable reasoning and substantially lower
inference cost.
  We extend the DLN framework to supervised tabular regression. Specifically,
we redesign the final output layer to support continuous targets and unify the
original two-phase training procedure into a single differentiable stage. We
evaluate the resulting model on 15 public regression benchmarks, comparing it
with modern neural networks and classical regression baselines. Regression DLNs
match or exceed baseline accuracy while preserving interpretability and fast
inference. Our results show that DLNs are a viable, cost-effective alternative
for regression tasks, especially where model transparency and computational
efficiency are important.

Conclusion: 结合阅读文本的提示和端到端训练策略，能有效提升转录和错误检测性能。

Abstract: Identifying mistakes (i.e., miscues) made while reading aloud is commonly
approached post-hoc by comparing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
transcriptions to the target reading text. However, post-hoc methods perform
poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current
methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end
architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is
trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection.
Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text
through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning,
and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for
end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's
read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies
improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: MCP协议易受FBAs攻击，威胁模型比之前认为的更广泛，需改进防御机制。

Method: 引入新MCP数据集，使用DPO和RAG-Pref方法训练LLM拒绝FBAs。

Result: DPO和RAG-Pref显著提升LLM对FBAs的拒绝能力，尤其是结合使用时效果更佳。

Conclusion: RAG-Pref结合DPO可大幅提升MCP攻击的防御能力，但效果受原始对齐方案影响。

Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard
enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work
has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks
(FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring
that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we
show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than
previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to
deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims'
systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP
dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of
direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language
models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we
show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the
model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to
refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel
preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly
improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with
DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

Result: 理论证明编码是图空间的等效表示，并在多个NAS基准测试中高效找到最优架构。

Conclusion: 该方法在图BO中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and
data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph
BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks
and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However,
the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph
structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph
search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit
optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as
reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph
kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed
encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide
restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical
results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the
optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.

Motivation: 传统链式思维（CoT）通过离散采样生成推理路径，而连续值标记（CoT2）提供了更丰富和灵活的替代方案，尤其在需要搜索能力的逻辑推理任务中。

Method: 论文提出了两种策略：1）在每一步解码时采样和组合K个离散标记以控制并行性；2）在概率单纯形上进行连续探索。此外，还设计了一种监督策略，将softmax输出与目标路径的标记分布匹配。

Result: 理论分析表明，CoT2允许模型并行跟踪多个推理路径，并证明了其在推理效率上的优势。实验证实，CoT2通过策略优化可以超越初始离散或连续监督的性能。

Conclusion: CoT2为链式思维提供了更高效的表达方式，尤其是在需要并行搜索的任务中，并通过策略优化实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Current language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively
sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has
achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with
continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive
alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning
tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and
exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model
to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference
efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably
solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding
dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy
where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a
set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that
unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy
samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the
level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second
strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex.
Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the
performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Conclusion: HDRQ是首个针对量化模型合并挑战的解决方案，有效提升了多目标域适应中的性能。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs隐式多跳推理的可解释性提供了新见解，并提出了增强模型透明度的途径。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop
reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly
verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by
training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our
analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,
followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution
generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but
accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level
exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we
introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies
semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based
representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with
the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn
provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across
training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These
findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop
reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold
internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.

Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh.
Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in
critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome
manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert
Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation.
Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e.,
a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target
mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an
out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical
graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically
projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate
AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical
components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER
generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent
baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and
Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with preference-based feedback has recently
garnered significant attention due to its emerging applications. We refer to
this problem as Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback (BOHF), which differs
from conventional BO by learning the best actions from a reduced feedback
model, where only the preference between two actions is revealed to the learner
at each time step. The objective is to identify the best action using a limited
number of preference queries, typically obtained through costly human feedback.
Existing work, which adopts the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) feedback model,
provides regret bounds for the performance of several algorithms. In this work,
within the same framework we develop tighter performance guarantees.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$, where $\Gamma(T)$ represents the
maximum information gain$\unicode{x2014}$a kernel-specific complexity
term$\unicode{x2014}$and $T$ is the number of queries. Our results
significantly improve upon existing bounds. Notably, for common kernels, we
show that the order-optimal sample complexities of conventional
BO$\unicode{x2014}$achieved with richer feedback models$\unicode{x2014}$are
recovered. In other words, the same number of preferential samples as
scalar-valued samples is sufficient to find a nearly optimal solution.

Abstract: Neural network minima are often connected by curves along which train and
test loss remain nearly constant, a phenomenon known as mode connectivity.
While this property has enabled applications such as model merging and
fine-tuning, its theoretical explanation remains unclear. We propose a new
approach to exploring the connectedness of minima using parameter space
symmetry. By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we
derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and
show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode
connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter
symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we
provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by
symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which
linear mode connectivity approximately holds. Our findings highlight the role
of continuous symmetries in understanding the neural network loss landscape.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在复杂组合任务中的学习能力，特别是数据分布对梯度优化学习的影响。

Method: 研究了$k$-fold组合任务的可学习性，提出统计查询下界，并通过两种课程学习策略（逐步增加难度和同时提供所有数据）进行实验。

Result: 证明了学习该任务需要指数级样本，但通过课程学习策略，梯度下降可以在多项式时间内高效学习。

Conclusion: 数据分布中同时包含简单和困难样本对Transformer学习复杂组合任务是必要且充分的。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Prior theoretical work exploring the
expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform
multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the
learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data
distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,
remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we
study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires
computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden
permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\log k)$ layers. On
the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that
any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for
the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in
$k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we
show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and
sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\log
k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in
which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \le k$
presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is
presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency
of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers
to learn complex compositional tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的Oracle Border Basis算法，通过Transformer模型加速Border basis计算，同时保证结果正确性，实现了最高3.5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式方程组求解方法（如Gröbner和Border bases）计算成本高，深度学习虽能提升效率但牺牲了正确性。本文旨在结合深度学习与传统算法，既提高效率又保证结果正确。

Method: 设计并训练了一个基于Transformer的oracle，用于识别和消除计算密集型步骤；开发了采样方法和首个Border basis采样定理；提出了紧凑的输入表示方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在关键计算阶段选择性调用oracle，实现了最高3.5倍的加速，且结果正确性未受影响。

Conclusion: Oracle Border Basis算法是一种数据高效、稳定的深度学习增强方法，为传统符号计算提供了实用改进。

Abstract: Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely
many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields.
Traditional methods like Gr\"obner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer
from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning
approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness.
In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep
Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining
output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle
that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which
we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this
oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup
factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the
correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling
method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a
tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic
computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which
reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of
$O(n)$. Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical
enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic
computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiCoFlex是一种新颖的模型无关条件生成框架，通过单次前向传递生成多样化的反事实解释，解决了现有方法在实时用户约束定制和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法需要持续访问预测模型、计算密集且缺乏灵活性，DiCoFlex旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用条件归一化流训练仅基于标记数据的模型，支持实时用户驱动的约束定制（如稀疏性和可操作性）。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上，DiCoFlex在有效性、多样性、接近性和约束遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiCoFlex为敏感决策领域提供了一种实用且可扩展的反事实生成解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives
that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance,
existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access
to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for
each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints
without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic,
conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals
in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained
solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling
real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and
actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity,
diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and
scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making
domains.

TL;DR: (U)NFV是一种模块化神经网络架构，用于解决双曲守恒律问题，结合了传统有限体积方法的数学优势与神经网络的灵活性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲偏微分方程（特别是守恒律）的解常包含激波和间断，传统有限体积方法虽具有数学优势（如收敛性、守恒性），但在复杂场景中精度和灵活性不足。

Method: (U)NFV通过扩展时空模板学习更新规则，同时保持守恒结构，支持监督学习（NFV）和无监督学习（UNFV）。

Result: 在解决一阶守恒律问题时，(U)NFV的误差比Godunov方法低10倍，优于ENO/WENO，性能接近间断Galerkin方法但复杂度更低；在交通建模中表现显著优于传统有限体积方法。

Conclusion: (U)NFV结合了神经网络的灵活性与传统方法的数学优势，显著提升了双曲守恒律问题的求解精度和适用性。

Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes
classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws.
Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve,
particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain
shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical
properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total
variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex
settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update
rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation
structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and
unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to
first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than
Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin
solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs
and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics
with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV
approaches.

Motivation: 解决VLA模型中实时控制需求与VLM设计之间的矛盾，避免引入连续动作专家模块时损害预训练VLM的语义知识。

Method: 通过分析不同设计选择的影响，提出了一种在VLA训练中保护VLM主干的技术。

Result: 研究发现，直接引入连续动作专家会显著损害训练速度和知识迁移，而提出的保护技术能有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 保护VLM主干的技术有助于在VLA模型中平衡实时控制需求与语义知识保留。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training
control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end
learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language
model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often
at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds
of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and
operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are
required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models
have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action
experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new
untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules
improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether
they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained
VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we
study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion
or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts
significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an
extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and
knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone
during VLA training that mitigates this issue. Videos are available at

TL;DR: TiRex是一种基于xLSTM的模型，通过结合状态跟踪和上下文学习能力，在零样本时间序列预测中表现优异，超越了现有的大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本预测方法（如基于Transformer的模型）在时间序列预测中表现不佳，而LSTM虽适合时间序列建模但缺乏上下文学习能力。TiRex旨在填补这一空白。

Method: TiRex利用增强的xLSTM，结合状态跟踪能力，并提出训练时掩码策略CPM以进一步提升性能。

Result: TiRex在HuggingFace基准测试GiftEval和Chronos-ZS中表现最佳，优于TabPFN-TS、Chronos Bolt、TimesFM和Moirai等模型。

Conclusion: TiRex通过结合xLSTM和CPM策略，成功实现了零样本时间序列预测的突破，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks
using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time
series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past
values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful
forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when
training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely
on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often
fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models
like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited
for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack
strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap
by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning
skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as
RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon
forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a
training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in
zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and
Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS
(Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce)
across both short- and long-term forecasts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为COBRA的算法，用于解决多智能体上下文赌博问题中智能体可能策略性报告的问题，无需货币激励即可实现激励兼容性和次线性遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设智能体会如实报告其选择，但现实中（如在线平台中的卖家）可能存在策略性行为（如虚假宣传），因此需要一种无需货币激励的解决方案。

Method: 提出COBRA算法，通过设计机制在不使用货币激励的情况下，抑制智能体的策略性行为，同时保证激励兼容性和次线性遗憾。

Result: 实验验证了COBRA算法在抑制策略性行为和性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: COBRA算法为多智能体上下文赌博问题提供了一种无需货币激励的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: DiffER是一种基于分类扩散的无模板化学逆合成预测方法，通过预测整个SMILES序列，在top-1准确率上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自然语言处理模型的化学逆合成方法受限于自回归特性，无法同时预测整个SMILES序列。

Method: 提出DiffER方法，采用分类扩散模型，结合长度预测组件，构建模型集合。

Result: 在top-1准确率上表现最佳，在top-3、top-5和top-10上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: DiffER为无模板模型提供了新基准，SMILES序列长度的准确预测是提升性能的关键。

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success
through the application of models traditionally built for natural language
processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have
demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of
chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their
autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method
for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which
allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We
construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art
performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5,
and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a
strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a
variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a
variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By
constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length
prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample
from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong
metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate
that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further
boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

TL;DR: SC-LoRA是一种新的LoRA初始化框架，通过约束低秩子空间中的输出，平衡微调效率和知识保留，解决了传统LoRA收敛慢和知识遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法在微调大型语言模型时存在收敛速度慢和知识遗忘的问题，现有方法无法同时解决这两个问题，因此需要一种新的框架。

Method: SC-LoRA通过约束可训练LoRA适配器的输出在低秩子空间中，平衡微调数据的上下文信息和保留知识的上下文信息。

Result: 实验表明，SC-LoRA在微调性能和减少知识遗忘方面优于现有LoRA初始化方法。

Conclusion: SC-LoRA成功解决了LoRA方法的局限性，为高效微调和知识保留提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and
knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of
designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to
preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can
address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce
Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework
engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and
knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable
LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of
fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved
knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the
trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data
while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide
theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including
safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream
tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning
performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing
contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

TL;DR: DiLoCo是一种在数据中心环境中提高并行性和加速器利用率的强大框架，但其通信步骤仍涉及全量参数传输。本文研究了标准压缩方法（如Top-k稀疏化和量化）与两种本地优化器（AdamW和Muon）结合的效果，发现Muon优化器配合误差反馈累积器可将通信压缩至2位且性能几乎无损。MuLoCo（Muon优化的DiLoCo）在通信量减少8倍的同时显著优于DiLoCo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DiLoCo减少了通信频率，但其通信步骤仍涉及全量参数传输，现有研究对误差反馈累积器和内部优化器对压缩性的影响研究不足。

Method: 研究了Top-k稀疏化和量化等标准压缩方法，结合两种本地优化器（AdamW和Muon），并利用误差反馈累积器进行实验。

Result: Muon优化器配合误差反馈累积器可将通信压缩至2位且性能几乎无损，MuLoCo在通信量减少8倍的同时显著优于DiLoCo。

Conclusion: MuLoCo在显著减少通信量的同时保持了性能，为大规模语言模型训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: DiLoCo is a powerful framework for training large language models (LLMs)
under networking constraints with advantages for increasing parallelism and
accelerator utilization in data center settings. Despite significantly reducing
communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve
all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works
have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error
feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility
remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization
for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local
optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only
transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner
optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to
aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no
performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo)
significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having
identical memory complexity.

TL;DR: EmotionRankCLAP通过引入Rank-N-Contrast目标，改进情感对比语言-音频预训练方法，提升跨模态对齐和情感顺序性建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感CLAP方法仅简单对齐音频与文本，未能捕捉情感的顺序性，导致跨模态理解不足和嵌入差距大。

Method: 提出EmotionRankCLAP，利用情感语音和文本提示的维度属性，通过Rank-N-Contrast目标学习有序关系。

Result: 在跨模态检索任务中，EmotionRankCLAP优于现有方法，能更好地建模情感顺序性。

Conclusion: EmotionRankCLAP通过改进对齐和学习情感顺序性，显著提升了情感CLAP方法的性能。

Abstract: Current emotion-based contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) methods
typically learn by na\"ively aligning audio samples with corresponding text
prompts. Consequently, this approach fails to capture the ordinal nature of
emotions, hindering inter-emotion understanding and often resulting in a wide
modality gap between the audio and text embeddings due to insufficient
alignment. To handle these drawbacks, we introduce EmotionRankCLAP, a
supervised contrastive learning approach that uses dimensional attributes of
emotional speech and natural language prompts to jointly capture fine-grained
emotion variations and improve cross-modal alignment. Our approach utilizes a
Rank-N-Contrast objective to learn ordered relationships by contrasting samples
based on their rankings in the valence-arousal space. EmotionRankCLAP
outperforms existing emotion-CLAP methods in modeling emotion ordinality across
modalities, measured via a cross-modal retrieval task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于社会选择理论和个体Bradley-Terry模型的评估方法，用于衡量对齐方法的失真程度，并比较了不同对齐方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如RLHF和DPO）假设与单一偏好模型对齐，但实际用户偏好多样，导致模型可能无法满足平均用户需求。

Method: 通过引入失真概念，评估对齐方法的最坏情况性能，并比较了Nash Learning、RLHF和DPO的失真表现。

Result: Nash Learning在最小化失真方面表现最优，而RLHF和DPO在不同条件下失真显著更高。

Conclusion: Nash Learning是一种更鲁棒的对齐方法，适用于多样用户偏好场景。

Abstract: After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences
based on pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as
PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single
preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse
preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods
produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for
pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users'
comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an
alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal
achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.
  The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment
methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal
distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature
$\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison
pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO,
by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a
KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full
setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.

Motivation: 现有序列模型（如Transformer）对图像块的固定顺序（如行优先）敏感，影响性能。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）基于信息论评估不同排列的压缩性；2）使用REINFORCE优化Plackett-Luce策略学习最优排列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和Functional Map of the World任务上，REOrder分别提升3.01%和13.35%的准确率。

Conclusion: REOrder通过优化图像块排列顺序，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Though prior work has shown empirical evidence for immunizing text-to-image
models, the key understanding of when immunization is possible and a precise
definition of an immunized model remain unclear. In this work, we propose a
framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model
immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an
algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers
after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization.

Abstract: Predicting protein complex structures is essential for protein function
analysis, protein design, and drug discovery. While AI methods like AlphaFold
can predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably
estimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy,
or EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key
barrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack
of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To
address this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four
large-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide
Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16).
PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of
protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and
modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary
quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also
provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate
rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and
evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE
was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing
EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for
advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly
available at: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PSBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于原子基础模型（AFM）的蛋白质局部环境表示方法，能有效捕捉结构和化学特征，并在生物分子NMR光谱中实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质局部结构对其功能和分子相互作用至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的表示方法。

Method: 利用原子基础模型（AFM）的中间特征构建蛋白质局部环境的表示。

Result: 该表示能捕捉局部结构和化学特征，并在化学位移预测中达到最优精度。

Conclusion: 原子基础模型为蛋白质建模提供了新思路，有望推动蛋白质功能表示的研究。

Abstract: The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and
interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative
representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and
designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments'
extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model,
and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a
novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the
intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate
that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary
motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation
state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits
meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the
distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of
biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations
enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising
effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations
for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this
will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional
representations for protein environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SLIT的新框架，旨在优化大型语言模型（LLM）的服务质量、碳排放、水资源消耗和能源成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛使用，其推理阶段的运营成本和环境问题日益突出，包括高碳排放和水资源消耗。

Method: 利用基于机器学习的元启发式方法，在分布式的云数据中心中优化LLM的可持续性。

Result: SLIT框架能够同时优化LLM的服务质量与环境影响。

Conclusion: 该框架对LLM的可持续发展至关重要，尤其是在其应用日益普及的背景下。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and
Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs
continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training
overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user
requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies
estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed
training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative
carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the
footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of
fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To
address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel
framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first
token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes
a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of
LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will
become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.

TL;DR: MIAS-SAM是一种用于医学图像异常区域分割的新方法，通过基于补丁的记忆库和SAM编码器提取特征，无需阈值即可实现精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决医学图像异常区域分割中需要手动设定阈值的问题，提高分割的准确性和自动化程度。

Method: 使用SAM编码器提取正常数据的图像特征并存入记忆库，推理时将嵌入补丁与记忆库对比生成异常图，最后通过异常图的重心提示SAM解码器完成分割。

Result: 在三种不同成像模态的公开数据集上（脑MRI、肝脏CT和视网膜OCT）表现出高精度的异常分割能力，DICE评分验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM无需手动设定阈值即可实现精确的异常区域分割，为医学图像分析提供了高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with
a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show
accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score. The code

TL;DR: VIMTS框架通过视觉MAE处理不规则多变量时间序列（IMTS）的缺失数据问题，利用跨通道依赖和自监督学习提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS数据因多通道信号未对齐和大量缺失值而难以建模，现有方法无法有效捕捉其时间模式。视觉MAE在稀疏多通道数据处理上的成功启发了VIMTS的提出。

Method: VIMTS将IMTS数据沿时间线分割为等间隔特征块，利用跨通道依赖补全缺失值，并通过视觉MAE进行块重建，结合粗到细技术生成预测。

Result: 实验证明VIMTS在IMTS预测中表现优异，并具备少样本学习能力。

Conclusion: VIMTS成功将视觉基础模型应用于更广泛的时间序列任务，提升了IMTS预测的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is

Conclusion: 该方法在可控性和视觉质量上优于现有方法，且兼容多种先进的视频生成模型。

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏对长距离空间一致性的关注，限制了世界模型在模拟和规划任务中的可靠性。

Method: 构建了一个包含150个不同位置的Minecraft数据集，收集了250小时（2000万帧）的循环导航视频，采用课程设计逐步增加序列长度。

Result: 评估了四种代表性世界模型基线，数据集和代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了空间一致性研究的空白，支持未来世界模型的发展。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual

Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在多源组合泛化任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新的数据集和框架。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of generalizing novel
compositions from seen primitives, and has received much attention in
vision-and-language (V\&L) recently. Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L
tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities,
resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

Result: GeoMan在定性和定量评估中均达到最先进性能，显著提升了时间一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMan通过创新的架构和表示方法，有效解决了3D人体几何估计中的长期挑战。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

Conclusion: EAD框架在多种EEG数据集上表现优异，具有零样本分类能力，展示了其泛化能力。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

Result: 在四个LVLMs上验证，VScan显著加速推理（LLaVA-NeXT-7B速度提升2.91倍，FLOPs减少10倍），性能保留95.4%。

Conclusion: VScan通过优化令牌处理，在加速推理的同时保持高性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

Conclusion: Zero-to-Hero方法在视频编辑中实现了高精度和时间一致性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video
editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user
intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of
objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach
named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this
by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference
image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We
leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

TL;DR: FlowAlign是一种基于流的免反演图像编辑框架，通过流匹配损失实现更稳定和一致的编辑轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于流的免反演方法（如FlowEdit）在编辑过程中存在轨迹不稳定和源一致性差的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出FlowAlign框架，引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，平衡编辑提示的语义对齐和源图像的结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，FlowAlign在源图像保留和编辑可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign通过流匹配损失实现了更稳定和一致的编辑，支持反向编辑，展示了其可逆性和一致性。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

TL;DR: CLIP模型无需解码器或训练即可实现图像合成，通过优化频率感知的隐式神经表示和引入稳定技术，展示了判别模型的潜在生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP作为判别模型是否具备未开发的生成能力，无需额外训练或解码器即可实现图像合成。

Method: 采用频率感知的隐式神经表示，结合对抗鲁棒初始化、正交Procrustes投影和混合损失，优化图像生成。

Result: 成功实现文本到图像生成、风格迁移和图像重建，无需修改CLIP权重。

Conclusion: 判别模型可能隐藏着未被发现的生成潜力，为多模态生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain
sight.

Abstract: The rise of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled the synthesis of
photorealistic human portraits, raising serious concerns about identity misuse
and the robustness of AIGC detectors. In this work, we propose an automated
adversarial prompt generation framework that leverages a grammar tree structure
and a variant of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to systematically
explore the semantic prompt space. Our method generates diverse, controllable
prompts that consistently evade both open-source and commercial AIGC detectors.
Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models validate its effectiveness,
and the approach ranked first in a real-world adversarial AIGC detection
competition. Beyond attack scenarios, our method can also be used to construct
high-quality adversarial datasets, providing valuable resources for training
and evaluating more robust AIGC detection and defense systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMamba是一种结合SAM2层次特征学习和Mamba选择性序列建模的新框架，用于红外小目标检测，通过FS-Adapter、CSI模块和DPCF模块解决了现有方法的不足，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测（ISTD）在军事、海事和预警应用中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在信息丢失和全局上下文建模效率低的问题。

Method: 提出SAMamba框架，包括FS-Adapter（双阶段选择）、CSI模块（选择性状态空间建模）和DPCF模块（多尺度特征融合）。

Result: 在NUAA-SIRST、IRSTD-1k和NUDT-SIRST数据集上，SAMamba显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂背景和多尺度目标场景中。

Conclusion: SAMamba通过桥接域差距、保持细粒度细节和高效建模长距离依赖，成功解决了ISTD的核心挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with
heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales. Code:

TL;DR: R2I-Bench是一个专门用于评估文本到图像生成模型推理能力的基准测试，包含多种推理类别，并通过R2IScore指标进行细粒度评估。实验表明当前模型的推理能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在推理能力方面表现不足，缺乏系统评估，因此需要开发一个专门的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了R2I-Bench基准测试，包含多种推理类别，并开发了R2IScore指标，通过QA式问题评估文本-图像对齐、推理准确性和图像质量。

Result: 对16种代表性模型的实验表明，其推理能力普遍有限，尤其是基于管道的框架表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前文本到图像生成模型的推理能力仍需改进，未来需要开发更强大的推理感知架构。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合视频帧和转录文本的多模态方法，通过强化学习框架生成视频摘要和检测亮点，优于仅依赖视觉内容的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频消费是日常生活的重要组成部分，但观看完整视频可能繁琐。现有方法未能在强化学习框架中整合视频帧和转录文本两种模态。

Method: 提出多模态管道，结合视频帧和转录文本，通过强化学习训练模型生成多样且具代表性的摘要，并确保包含有意义的转录内容。

Result: 实验表明，结合转录文本的视频摘要和亮点检测方法优于仅依赖视觉内容的方法。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在视频摘要和亮点检测中表现优越，强化学习框架有效解决了大规模未标注数据的学习问题。

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

Motivation: 探索基于规则的强化学习在多模态大语言模型中的表现，尤其是在感知密集型任务中与传统文本领域的差异。

Method: 使用拼图任务作为结构化实验框架，对比强化学习（RL）和监督微调（SFT）的表现。

Result: MLLMs通过微调显著提升拼图任务表现，并能泛化到复杂任务；RL比SFT泛化能力更强；复杂推理模式是预存的而非突现的。

Conclusion: 拼图任务为理解基于规则的视觉RL提供了重要参考，RL在多模态学习中具有潜力，但初始SFT阶段可能阻碍后续RL优化。

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索联邦学习在无监督语义图像分割中的应用，解决分布式客户端在异构数据分布下特征和聚类中心对齐的挑战。

Method: 提出FUSS框架，引入新的联邦策略，优化局部分割头和共享语义中心，确保特征和原型空间的全局一致性。

Result: 在基准和真实数据集上，FUSS在二进制和多类分割任务中均优于本地训练和经典联邦学习算法。

Conclusion: FUSS为无监督语义分割提供了一种有效的联邦学习方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注自然视频，忽略AIGC视频，且MLLMs对AIGC视频的理解能力未被充分研究。

Method: 提出VF-Eval基准，包含四项任务（连贯性验证、错误感知、错误类型检测、推理评估），评估13种前沿MLLMs。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4.1在所有任务中表现仍不稳定，显示基准的挑战性。实验RePrompt表明MLLMs与人类反馈对齐可改进视频生成。

Conclusion: VF-Eval揭示了MLLMs在AIGC视频上的局限性，并展示了其在视频生成中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

Motivation: 尽管PAR在深度学习推动下取得进展，但其抗干扰能力和脆弱性尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于预训练的CLIP框架，采用多模态Transformer融合视觉与文本特征，并通过对抗语义和标签扰动生成噪声（ASL-PAR），同时设计语义偏移防御策略。

Result: 在数字和物理领域的多个数据集上验证了攻击与防御策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ASL-PAR框架为PAR的对抗攻击与防御提供了新思路，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however,
probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation
reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了图像质量，并能够生成超出预训练分布（如ImageNet）的风格化图像，同时得益于VAR模型的快速推理速度。

Conclusion: RL微调对VAR模型既高效又有效，尤其在快速推理和在线采样方面优于扩散模型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAN-Crafter提出了一种模态一致对齐框架，通过模态自适应重建和跨模态对齐感知注意力机制，解决了PAN与MS图像融合中的跨模态不对齐问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAN与MS图像融合中因传感器位置、采集时间和分辨率差异导致的跨模态不对齐问题，传统深度学习方法假设完美对齐，导致光谱失真和模糊。

Method: 提出PAN-Crafter框架，包括模态自适应重建（MARs）和跨模态对齐感知注意力（CM3A）机制，联合重建HRMS和PAN图像，并双向对齐特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PAN-Crafter在所有指标上均优于最新方法，推理速度快50.11倍，内存占用减少0.63倍，且在不同卫星数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PAN-Crafter通过模态一致对齐和自适应特征细化，显著提升了PAN与MS图像融合的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution
multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

TL;DR: VModA框架通过适应多样化审核规则和复杂语义内容，显著提升了NSFW内容检测的准确性，实验结果显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSFW内容在社交网络上泛滥，现有检测方法难以应对复杂语义和多样化规则，亟需更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出VModA框架，适应多样化审核规则并处理复杂语义的NSFW内容，通过实验验证其性能。

Result: VModA在NSFW检测中表现优异，准确率提升高达54.3%，并展现出跨类别和场景的强适应性。

Conclusion: VModA为NSFW内容检测提供了高效且通用的解决方案，同时修正了公共数据集中的标签问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world
scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉配音方法在无缝集成到原始场景或保留复杂视觉信息方面存在不足，EdiDub旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EdiDub将视觉配音重新定义为内容感知编辑任务，采用专门的调节方案以保留原始视频上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EdiDub在身份保持和同步方面表现优异，人类评估也证实其同步性和视觉自然性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 内容感知编辑方法在保持复杂视觉元素和准确唇同步方面优于传统生成或修复方法。

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

TL;DR: CryoCCD是一个结合生物物理建模与生成技术的合成框架，用于生成多尺度冷冻电镜显微图像，解决了现有方法在结构多样性和噪声复杂性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）在近原子分辨率成像中表现优异，但高质量标注数据的稀缺阻碍了稳健模型的开发。

Method: CryoCCD通过整合生物物理建模与生成技术，生成具有生物物理多样性和复杂噪声的显微图像，并采用条件扩散模型和对比学习增强噪声真实性。

Result: 实验表明，CryoCCD生成的图像结构准确，在下游任务（如颗粒挑选和重建）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CryoCCD为冷冻电镜图像合成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了数据质量和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

TL;DR: DeepChest是一种动态任务加权框架，用于多标签胸部X射线分类，通过性能驱动的权重机制显著提升训练速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务学习中任务贡献平衡的挑战，特别是在医学影像领域。

Method: 提出DeepChest框架，基于任务特定损失趋势动态调整权重，无需梯度访问，降低内存使用。

Result: 在大型CXR数据集上，DeepChest比现有方法准确率提高7%，训练速度提升三倍。

Conclusion: DeepChest为医学诊断中的深度学习提供了更高效和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multi-Task Learning (MTL) offers inherent advantages in complex domains
such as medical imaging by enabling shared representation learning, effectively
balancing task contributions remains a significant challenge. This paper
addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel,
computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework
specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike
existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial
overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on
effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture
(e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task
importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be
easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency
and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust
deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体轨迹的视频标记化方法TrajViT，显著减少冗余标记并保持性能，优于传统的时空ViT（ViT3D）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频标记化方法因使用固定时空块导致标记过多且计算效率低，而现有标记减少策略在相机移动时效果不佳。

Method: 提出基于全景子物体轨迹的标记化方法TrajViT，通过对比学习训练，将物体轨迹转化为语义标记。

Result: TrajViT在多个视频理解任务中显著优于ViT3D，如视频-文本检索任务中Top-5召回率提升6%，且标记减少10倍。

Conclusion: TrajViT是首个在多样化视频分析任务中一致优于ViT3D的高效编码器，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种基于持久同调（PH）的特征向量构建方法在医学图像分类中的效果，发现特征拼接方法优于聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征提取方法对输入的小变化敏感，而持久同调（PH）具有鲁棒性和稳定性，因此研究其在医学图像分析中的应用。

Method: 使用持久同调（PH）提取特征，比较聚合持久条形码和拼接特征向量两种方法在分类模型中的表现。

Result: 特征拼接方法保留了更多细节拓扑信息，分类性能更好。

Conclusion: 在类似实验中，特征拼接是更优的选择。

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLDTracker的新型视觉目标跟踪框架，通过结合视觉和语言信息解决传统跟踪器在复杂场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉目标跟踪（VOT）在动态外观变化、遮挡和背景干扰下仍具挑战性，传统跟踪器依赖视觉线索表现不佳，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出CLDTracker，采用双分支架构（文本分支和视觉分支），利用CLIP和GPT-4V等VLMs生成丰富的文本描述，增强语义和上下文信息。

Result: 在六个标准VOT基准测试中达到SOTA性能，验证了结合视觉和语言信息的有效性。

Conclusion: CLDTracker通过丰富的语言描述和高效的特征融合，显著提升了跟踪性能，展示了VLMs在VOT任务中的潜力。

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

TL;DR: SLIMP提出了一种新的嵌套对比学习方法，结合皮肤病变图像和元数据，提升皮肤病变分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于仅依赖图像的黑色素瘤检测和皮肤病变分类存在成像条件和临床背景不足的挑战，SLIMP旨在通过结合图像和患者元数据，模拟医生的整体评估方法。

Method: SLIMP采用嵌套对比学习，整合单个皮肤病变的外观、元数据以及患者级别的医疗记录和其他临床信息。

Result: 相比其他预训练策略，SLIMP在下游皮肤病变分类任务中表现更优，证明了其学习到的表征质量。

Conclusion: SLIMP通过充分利用多模态数据，显著提升了皮肤病变分类的性能，为临床决策提供了更全面的支持。

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Result: CFP-Gen能够高通量生成功能与天然蛋白质相当的新型蛋白质，并在设计多功能蛋白质时具有高成功率。

Conclusion: CFP-Gen为多约束蛋白质设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition
constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy
multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput
generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins,
while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins. Code

Conclusion: 多模态输入结合两阶段训练方法显著提升了CAD重建的性能和通用性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for
any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable
coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,
controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis. Code and model

Conclusion: SOYO在复杂动态环境中具有显著优势，代码将开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often underperform in real-world, dynamic
settings where data distributions change over time. Domain Incremental Learning
(DIL) offers a solution by enabling continual model adaptation, with
Parameter-Isolation DIL (PIDIL) emerging as a promising paradigm to reduce
knowledge conflicts. However, existing PIDIL methods struggle with parameter
selection accuracy, especially as the number of domains and corresponding
classes grows. To address this, we propose SOYO, a lightweight framework that
improves domain selection in PIDIL. SOYO introduces a Gaussian Mixture
Compressor (GMC) and Domain Feature Resampler (DFR) to store and balance prior
domain data efficiently, while a Multi-level Domain Feature Fusion Network
(MDFN) enhances domain feature extraction. Our framework supports multiple
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and is validated across tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and speech enhancement.
Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate SOYO's consistent
superiority over existing baselines, showcasing its robustness and adaptability

Motivation: VLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但在安全关键领域容易产生错误预测，可能导致严重后果，因此需要提高其预测的可信度。

Method: 提出了一种基于图像嵌入空间的置信度评分函数，利用模态间隙和概念在嵌入空间中的区分性改进误分类检测。

Conclusion: TrustVLM无需重新训练即可提高VLM的可靠性，为其在现实应用中的安全部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,
often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a
significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We
rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4
architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95
compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model
without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of
VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有3D MLLM依赖额外3D或2.5D数据，限制了其在仅2D输入场景中的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升空间智能。

Result: 在多种真实数据集上，Spatial-MLLM在视觉空间理解和推理任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Spatial-MLLM为纯2D输入场景提供了高效的视觉空间推理解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的方法在持续学习中需要为每个任务分配部分参数，导致推理时参数选择错误，影响性能。

Method: LADA在冻结的CLIP图像编码器后添加标签特定记忆单元，通过特征蒸馏防止新类干扰旧类特征。

Result: LADA在持续学习任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LADA通过轻量级设计和特征蒸馏，有效解决了持续学习中的参数分配和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at

Result: TimePoint在速度和准确性上均优于标准DTW，且仅通过合成数据训练即可泛化到真实世界时间序列。

Conclusion: TimePoint为时间序列分析提供了一种可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

TL;DR: OmniEarth-Bench是一个全面的地球科学多模态基准测试，覆盖六个地球科学领域及其交互，包含100个专家策划的评估维度，现有最先进模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在地球科学多模态学习中存在系统性覆盖不足和评估维度有限的问题，无法全面评估跨领域交互。

Method: 利用卫星和实地观测数据，整合29,779个标注，涵盖感知、推理、科学知识推理和链式思维推理四个层级，通过专家和众包协作减少标注歧义。

Result: 测试9个最先进的多模态模型，表现均不理想，最高准确率不足35%，某些跨领域任务中GPT-4o准确率降至0%。

Conclusion: OmniEarth-Bench为地球科学AI设定了新标准，推动了科学发现和环境监测的实际应用，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical
limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere
interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in
Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less
than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first
comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres
(atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and
Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the
performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets
a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and
practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The
dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

*Xu Chu,Xinrong Chen,Guanyu Wang,Zhijie Tan,Kui Huang,Wenyu Lv,Tong Mo,Weiping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Qwen-LA通过引入视觉-文本反射过程，减少视觉语言推理模型（VLRMs）中的幻觉问题，提升视觉注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理过程导致视觉信息被稀释，引发幻觉问题，现有文本反射方法不足以解决。

Method: 提出Qwen-LA模型，结合BRPO强化学习方法，动态生成视觉-文本反射，并引入Visual Token COPY和ROUTE机制增强视觉注意力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答数据集和幻觉指标上，Qwen-LA表现领先，减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 视觉-文本反射和视觉注意力增强机制有效提升VLRMs性能。

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: DeepMultiConnectome是一种深度学习模型，直接从纤维追踪预测结构连接组，无需灰质分区，支持多种分区方案，速度快且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连接组生成方法耗时且依赖灰质分区，限制了大规模研究。

Method: 使用基于点云的神经网络和多任务学习，模型根据两种分区方案对纤维束进行分类，共享学习表示。

Result: 预测的连接组与传统方法生成的高度相关（r=0.992和0.986），保留了网络特性，测试-重测分析显示可重复性。

Conclusion: DeepMultiConnectome提供了一种快速、可扩展的方法，支持多种分区方案生成个体化连接组。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Conclusion: 该方法在多发性硬化症边缘病变的检测中表现出临床可解释的改进，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN

Result: CNN在某些方面优于多模态技术，但结合LLM的过滤技术可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 多模态AI系统在医学诊断中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely
classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets,
the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative
analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution
efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy,
F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated
$CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can
outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and
contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead
to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and
scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.

*Christian Schmidt,Heinrich Martin Overhoff*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于主成分分析（PCA）的新方法，用于提高医学超声图像分割模型在未见数据集上的外部有效性。实验表明，PCA预处理能显著提升召回率和Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在跨数据集部署时外部有效性不足，尤其是在超声图像领域。现有方法（如域适应和GAN）在小规模多样化数据集上效果有限。

Method: 通过PCA预处理减少噪声并保留90%的数据方差，生成降维后的PCA数据集。使用U-Net模型分别在原始数据集和PCA数据集上训练和测试。

Result: PCA方法显著提升了召回率（0.57→0.70）和Dice分数（0.50→0.58），并将外部验证导致的召回率下降减少了33%。

Conclusion: PCA重建是一种有效的方法，可提升医学图像分割模型的外部有效性，尤其在挑战性案例中表现突出。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文介绍了$k$-DTW，一种新的多边形曲线不相似性度量方法，比DTW具有更强的度量性质，比Fréchet距离对异常值更鲁棒。提供了精确算法和近似算法，并证明了维度无关的学习边界。$k$-DTW在聚类和最近邻分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DTW和Fréchet距离在多边形曲线不相似性度量中存在局限性，$k$-DTW旨在提供更强的度量性质和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了$k$-DTW度量方法，开发了精确算法和$(1+\varepsilon)$-近似算法，并通过参数搜索实现。

Result: $k$-DTW在样本量需求和Rademacher/Gaussian复杂性上优于DTW，实验验证了其在聚类和分类中的优势。

Conclusion: $k$-DTW是一种高效且鲁棒的多边形曲线不相似性度量方法，具有理论支持和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel
dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric
properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than
the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity
measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and
give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We
prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning
theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the
problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the
curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising
separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW
admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$
when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental
illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest
neighbor classification.

Conclusion: 扩展的框架在理论和实践中均表现出色，为从非结构化意见中生成代表性陈述提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of
statements that proportionally represents the full spectrum of user opinions.
This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings,
the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so
it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and
large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a
framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two
fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of
approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the
slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets
related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user
opinions.

Motivation: 研究在有限时间内委托人与多种类型代理交互时的最优激励策略，以最小化后悔。

Method: 分析了两种设置：1）委托人知道代理类型对激励的贪婪选择；2）代理响应随激励平滑变化。提出了对应算法并给出后悔上界。

Result: 在第一种设置下，算法后悔上界为O(min{√(KTlogN), K√T})；第二种设置下为Õ((LN)^(1/3)T^(2/3))。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下可实现次线性后悔，并扩展了同时激励多臂的算法。

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite
horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of
agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal
strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent
of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the
provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The
objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.
Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes
intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where
sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the
arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this
setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of
$O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to
a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly
with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under
this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of
$\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to
logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both
settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously
in each round.

TL;DR: BinauralFlow是一个基于流匹配的流式双耳语音合成框架，旨在解决双耳渲染中的质量和流式推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双耳渲染需要模拟自然听觉，现有方法在渲染质量和流式推理上表现不佳。

Method: 提出条件流匹配模型和因果U-Net架构，结合流式STFT/ISTFT操作和缓冲银行等技术。

Result: 定量和定性评估显示方法优于现有技术，感知研究表明模型与真实录音难以区分（42%混淆率）。

Conclusion: BinauralFlow在双耳渲染质量和流式推理方面表现出色，接近真实录音效果。

Abstract: Binaural rendering aims to synthesize binaural audio that mimics natural
hearing based on a mono audio and the locations of the speaker and listener.
Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle
with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality
binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires
precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds.
Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address
these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech
synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a
generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional
flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal
U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past
information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we
introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT
operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to
improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A
perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable
from real-world recordings, with a $42\%$ confusion rate.

Abstract: Auscultation is crucial for diagnosing lung diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic
has revealed the limitations of traditional, in-person lung sound assessments.
To overcome these issues, advancements in digital stethoscopes and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of new diagnostic methods. In
this context, our study aims to use smartphone microphones to record and
analyze lung sounds. We faced two major challenges: the difference in audio
style between electronic stethoscopes and smartphone microphones, and the
variability among patients. To address these challenges, we developed a method
called Patient Domain Supervised Contrastive Learning (PD-SCL). By integrating
this method with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, we
significantly improved its performance by 2.4\% compared to the original AST
model. This progress demonstrates that smartphones can effectively diagnose
lung sounds, addressing inconsistencies in patient data and showing potential
for broad use beyond traditional clinical settings. Our research contributes to
making lung disease detection more accessible in the post-COVID-19 world.

Conclusion: Nosey是商业鼻音测量设备的有效替代方案，适合数据收集，并需注意使用方法。

Abstract: We introduce Nosey (Nasalance Open Source Estimation sYstem), a low-cost,
customizable, 3D-printed system for recording acoustic nasalance data that we
have made available as open-source hardware
(http://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey). We first outline the motivations and
design principles behind our hardware nasalance system, and then present a
comparison between Nosey and a commercial nasalance device. Nosey shows
consistently higher nasalance scores than the commercial device, but the
magnitude of contrast between phonological environments is comparable between
systems. We also review ways of customizing the hardware to facilitate testing,
such as comparison of microphones and different construction materials. We
conclude that Nosey is a flexible and cost-effective alternative to commercial
nasometry devices and propose some methodological considerations for its use in
data collection.

Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous
music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike
prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a
joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within
a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1)
complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation),
and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both
separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space,
our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary
instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across
heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without
relying on predefined instrument categories. Audio samples are available at our
project page: https://yoongi43.github.io/MGELDM_Samples/.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频谱时域调制（STM）特征的新方法，其分类性能与预训练的音频深度神经网络相当，且计算成本低、可解释性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频深度神经网络的计算成本高且难以解释，需要优化。

Method: 采用模仿人类听觉皮层神经生理表征的频谱时域调制（STM）特征。

Result: STM模型在未预训练的情况下，分类性能与预训练音频DNN相当，适用于语音、音乐和环境声音分类。

Conclusion: STM是一种高效且可解释的音频分类特征表示，推动了机器听觉的发展，并为语音和听觉科学的基础研究及音频BCI和认知计算提供了新可能。

Abstract: Audio DNNs have demonstrated impressive performance on various machine
listening tasks; however, most of their representations are computationally
costly and uninterpretable, leaving room for optimization. Here, we propose a
novel approach centered on spectrotemporal modulation (STM) features, a signal
processing method that mimics the neurophysiological representation in the
human auditory cortex. The classification performance of our STM-based model,
without any pretraining, is comparable to that of pretrained audio DNNs across
diverse naturalistic speech, music, and environmental sounds, which are
essential categories for both human cognition and machine perception. These
results show that STM is an efficient and interpretable feature representation
for audio classification, advancing the development of machine listening and
unlocking exciting new possibilities for basic understanding of speech and
auditory sciences, as well as developing audio BCI and cognitive computing.

TL;DR: ADD-GP是一个基于高斯过程的少样本自适应框架，用于音频深度伪造检测，具有强适应性和个性化检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TTS技术的进步，检测模型需要高效适应未见过的生成模型，且数据需求少。

Method: 结合深度嵌入模型与高斯过程的灵活性，实现高性能和适应性。

Result: ADD-GP在新TTS模型上表现稳健，支持单样本适应。

Conclusion: ADD-GP为音频深度伪造检测提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, particularly in voice
cloning, have intensified the demand for adaptable and efficient deepfake
detection methods. As TTS systems continue to evolve, detection models must be
able to efficiently adapt to previously unseen generation models with minimal
data. This paper introduces ADD-GP, a few-shot adaptive framework based on a
Gaussian Process (GP) classifier for Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD). We show
how the combination of a powerful deep embedding model with the Gaussian
processes flexibility can achieve strong performance and adaptability.
Additionally, we show this approach can also be used for personalized
detection, with greater robustness to new TTS models and one-shot adaptability.
To support our evaluation, a benchmark dataset is constructed for this task
using new state-of-the-art voice cloning models.

Motivation: 准确建模不规则观测的时间连续随机过程是一个重要挑战，本文旨在推动时间序列生成的边界。

Method: 受轨迹流匹配启发，提出新的SDE和跳跃过程生成器，通过参数化跳跃核密度（如缩放高斯）处理不连续性，并支持不规则采样。

Result: 能够处理不规则采样时间序列，并通过闭式KL散度公式优化损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在时间序列生成中表现出色，尤其适用于不规则采样数据。

Abstract: Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular
observations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we leverage ideas
from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series
generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes,
inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of
the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the
underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled
Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding
Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are
able to handle irregularly sampled time series.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖神经网络的优化和前向SDE模拟，计算成本高，提出一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用后向Kolmogorov算子的稀疏特征基展开分数函数，将分数估计转化为线性系统求解。

Result: 通过扰动理论分析近似误差，并在高维Boltzmann分布和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法避免了迭代优化和时变样本生成，为扩散模型提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling,
typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function
via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method
that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score
function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator
associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the
solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent
sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann
distributions and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs作为动态知识体现的新视角，以理解其交互、表征和代理能力。

Method: 结合神经科学和AI理论，通过与ChatGPT-4的持续互动分析对话模式、微调影响及人机认知协同增强。

Result: 揭示了对话模式的新特征，提出了人机认知协同增强的概念。

Conclusion: 为理解当代AI系统的交互、表征和代理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically analysed through architectural,
behavioural, or training-data lenses. This article offers a theoretical and
experiential re-framing: LLMs as dynamic instantiations of Collective human
Knowledge (CK), where intelligence is evoked through dialogue rather than
stored statically. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience and AI, and grounded
in sustained interaction with ChatGPT-4, I examine emergent dialogue patterns,
the implications of fine-tuning, and the notion of co-augmentation: mutual
enhancement between human and machine cognition. This perspective offers a new
lens for understanding interaction, representation, and agency in contemporary
AI systems.

TL;DR: Orca是一个基于AI的浏览器原型，旨在增强用户在多个网页间的交互和信息合成能力，同时保持用户控制权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统浏览器在多标签页操作和大规模信息合成方面表现不足，而现有AI系统又削弱了用户的主动性和上下文理解。因此，研究如何通过AI增强用户在多网页间的交互能力。

Method: 通过文献综述和迭代设计过程，开发了Orca浏览器原型，将网页视为可塑材料，支持用户与AI协作操作和合成内容。

Result: 评估显示，Orca提高了用户的信息获取欲望、控制权以及在更广泛信息环境中的灵活性。

Conclusion: Orca展示了AI如何在不削弱用户主动性的情况下，增强多网页间的交互和信息合成能力。

Abstract: Web-based activities are fundamentally distributed across webpages. However,
conventional browsers with stacks of tabs fail to support operating and
synthesizing large volumes of information across pages. While recent AI systems
enable fully automated web browsing and information synthesis, they often
diminish user agency and hinder contextual understanding. Therefore, we explore
how AI could instead augment users' interactions with content across webpages
and mitigate cognitive and manual efforts. Through literature on information
tasks and web browsing challenges, and an iterative design process, we present
a rich set of novel interactions with our prototype web browser, Orca.
Leveraging AI, Orca supports user-driven exploration, operation, organization,
and synthesis of web content at scale. To enable browsing at scale, webpages
are treated as malleable materials that humans and AI can collaboratively
manipulate and compose into a malleable, dynamic, and browser-level workspace.
Our evaluation revealed an increased "appetite" for information foraging,
enhanced user control, and more flexibility in sensemaking across a broader
information landscape on the web.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Human-in-the-loop Decoding的新交互技术，旨在让用户在代码生成过程中观察并直接影响LLM的决策，以减少对AI工具的过度依赖。通过HiLDe实现，实验显示其在安全相关任务中显著减少了漏洞生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI编程工具虽能提升程序员能力，但可能导致用户过度依赖系统解决方案，尤其在关键领域（如软件安全）中产生严重后果。

Method: 提出Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术，并在HiLDe代码补全助手中实现，允许用户观察和干预LLM的决策。

Result: 在18人的实验中，HiLDe显著减少了漏洞生成，并更好地与用户目标对齐。

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术能有效减少对AI工具的过度依赖，提升代码生成的安全性和用户控制。

Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers'
capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users
from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off
their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These
behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software
security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique
that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code
generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal
requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant
that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local
alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on
security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate
significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their
goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合多模态数据和心理学知识的大型语言模型（LLM）方法，用于抑郁症检测，显著提升了诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症检测通常依赖文本数据，但忽略了非文本线索（如语音和行为），且缺乏心理学专业知识。论文旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ数据集，提取音频特征（Wav2Vec模型），并将其映射到文本LLM中处理。同时，通过问答集将心理学知识融入LLM。

Result: 与原始论文的基准分数相比，该方法在MAE和RMSE上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合多模态数据和心理学知识的LLM方法能有效提升抑郁症检测的准确性。

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HEAE的人机协作框架，通过结合学生叙述文本和教师衍生的‘共情向量’，提升抑郁严重程度评估的透明度和社会责任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特殊教育等敏感环境中，标准化问卷和自动化方法难以准确评估学生抑郁情况，且缺乏教师的个性化共情洞察。

Method: HEAE框架整合学生叙述文本与基于PHQ-9框架的9维‘共情向量’，通过多模态融合和优化分类架构实现抑郁严重程度分类。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在7级抑郁严重程度分类中达到82.74%的准确率。

Conclusion: HEAE为情感计算提供了一种更负责任和伦理化的方法，通过结构化嵌入人类共情提升评估效果。

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education
is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students'
true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student
narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from
teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to
address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To
address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration,
this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

Motivation: 现有的统计n-gram语言模型在自动语音识别（ASR）中因并行化不足导致计算效率低下，限制了工业应用。

Method: 重新设计了统计n-gram语言模型的数据结构，支持快速并行操作，提出了NGPU-LM方法，适用于多种ASR模型类型，计算开销低于7%。

Result: 在域外场景下，NGPU-LM将贪婪解码与束搜索的准确率差距缩小了50%以上，同时避免了束搜索的显著减速。

Conclusion: NGPU-LM为ASR中的上下文偏置任务提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，其实现已开源。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding
significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed
NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能够同时处理语音和图像输入的问答系统，以扩展传统文本问答系统的功能。

Method: 通过融合文本、语音和图像模态，训练多模态模型，并使用零样本TTS模型合成数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 模型仅使用合成语音训练时，性能接近基于文本问答的上限模型，且TTS模型的选择对准确性影响较小。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法在SVQA任务中具有潜力，合成数据集为训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language
questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA
system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both
speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and
image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting
multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken
questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three
modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by
synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings
indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the
performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we
show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

Conclusion: 该系统在实时语音增强中表现优异，适用于流式处理，并在2025 Urgent Challenge中取得进展。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with
GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the
mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the
full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to
over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was
shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the
stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We
use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M
parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming
with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over
the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation
study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We
participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further
improvements.

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological
amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with
interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one
cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in
cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance
by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for
strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏有效方法捕捉BIM模型中组件间的复杂空间和拓扑关系，这些关系对理解设计模式和决策至关重要。

Method: 通过扩展IFC标准，引入局部空间关系和拓扑连接，构建了一个整合语义、空间和拓扑多维特征的网络表示方法。

Result: 该方法能够更详细地理解组件间的交互、依赖和隐含设计模式，有效捕捉BIM中的多维关系。

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction
industry by providing a comprehensive digital representation of building
structures throughout their lifecycle. However, existing research lacks
effective methods for capturing the complex spatial and topological
relationships between components in BIM models, which are essential for
understanding design patterns and enhancing decision-making. This study
proposes a unified network-based representation method that integrates the
"semantic-spatial-topological" multi-dimensional design features of BIM models.
By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local
spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich
the network structure. This representation method enables a more detailed
understanding of component interactions, dependencies, and implicit design
patterns, effectively capturing the semantic, topological, and spatial
relationships in BIM, and holds significant potential for the representation
and learning of design patterns.

this task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the

movement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We
observed that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid
sides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower
complexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose
a novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the
performance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing
the ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters.
We applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines
and validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks
in the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention
(MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate
its role in modeling stock price movements. Our experiments used raw data and
widely used Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features as input with some strong
baseline models. The results show that our method improves the performance of
strong baselines in over 75$% of cases, excluding the Multi-Layer Perception
(MLP) baseline, which performed poorly and is not considered practical.
Furthermore, we found that Multi-Head Attention can enhance model performance,
particularly over shorter forecasting horizons.

TL;DR: ConnectomeDiffuser是一种新型的基于扩散的框架，用于从DTI数据自动构建脑网络，解决了现有方法的局限性，并提高了诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建结构脑网络时存在主观性、工作流程繁琐以及无法捕捉复杂拓扑特征等问题，ConnectomeDiffuser旨在克服这些挑战。

Method: 结合模板网络、扩散模型和图卷积网络分类器，从DTI数据中提取拓扑特征并生成全面的脑网络。

Result: 实验验证表明，ConnectomeDiffuser在捕捉结构连接性和病理信息方面表现优越，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经退行性疾病的诊断和研究提供了更准确、通用的工具。

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Result: 网络倾向于近似正交化的吸引子表示，优化预测准确性和模型复杂性，增强泛化能力和互信息。

Conclusion: 该理论为自组织吸引子网络提供了统一框架，对AI和神经科学具有新见解。

Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the
brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first
principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations
and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how
attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal
partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for
explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but
efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such
self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian
active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior
beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning
fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via
simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately
orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously
optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors
efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual
information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while
random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential
data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics,
offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings
offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel
insights for AI and neuroscience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms for recommender
systems by enabling richer semantic understanding and incorporating implicit
world knowledge. In this study, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
classifies existing approaches into two categories: (1) Pure LLM Recommenders,
which rely solely on LLMs, and (2) Augmented LLM Recommenders, which integrate
additional non-LLM techniques to enhance performance. This taxonomy provides a

recommendation. To support fair comparison, we introduce a unified evaluation
platform that benchmarks representative models under consistent experimental
settings, highlighting key design choices that impact effectiveness. We
conclude by discussing open challenges and outlining promising directions for
future research. This work offers both a comprehensive overview and practical
guidance for advancing next-generation LLM-powered recommender.

Motivation: CoT提示在大型语言模型中可能导致过度思考，产生冗余且偏离用户意图的推理轨迹，影响信息检索效率。

Method: 提出SMR框架，基于离散动作（Refine, Rerank, Stop）实现过渡式推理，支持早期停止和细粒度控制。

Result: 在BEIR和BRIGHT基准测试中，SMR提升检索性能（nDCG@10）3.4%，同时减少74.4%的token使用。

Conclusion: SMR是一种无需任务特定调优的实用替代方案，适用于多种LLM和检索器。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However,
it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and
semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key
challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and
misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we
propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework
composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping
and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show
that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token
usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring
task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT
reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.

Result: 在开发集上MRR@5为76.46%，测试集为66.43%，分别排名第一和第三。

Conclusion: 精心设计和微调的检索管道在开源模型下表现出色，无需外部训练数据。

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask
4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving
relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this
task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision,
semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust
retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we
combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a
fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns
the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are
then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the
development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on
the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31
teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to
the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running
open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the
effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.

Abstract: A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when
guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For
example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be
both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper
crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical
for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion
for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the
new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with
atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts
atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their
user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to
rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system
development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are
manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially
generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect
utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic
selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based
judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that
serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with
ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual
annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we
hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in
this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go
beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.

Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High

method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset, approximating typical HDR signal
scenarios with adjustable target distributions. Simulation results show about
1% total detection probability improvement with under 0.9% computational
complexity added compared with the baseline. Furthermore, it excels 5% over the
baseline at the range in 11-13 dB signal-to-noise ratio typical for urban
targets. Finally, the real experiment validates the practicality of our model.

future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow
signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS)
methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory,
we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming
signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed
stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions,
steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the
impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design
optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired
estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g.,
the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that
integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a
distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and
mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world
traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed
settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order
topological features.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine
learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality
rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health
interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models
are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative
datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior,
remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of
diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results
highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public
health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features
(e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level
case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive
performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge
prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and
pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating
alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to
enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.

Motivation: 探索如何在非凸泛函优化中通过选择合适的正则化参数和参考测度，使最佳响应流（Best Response flow）收敛，并扩展其在强化学习中的应用。

Method: 利用最佳响应流（虚构博弈流），分析其收敛性受非凸性、正则化参数和参考测度尾部行为的影响，提出如何选择正则化器使最佳响应算子成为收缩映射。

Result: 证明了在特定正则化器选择下，最佳响应算子具有唯一不动点，即优化问题的全局最小解，并扩展了其在强化学习中的应用。

Conclusion: 通过特定正则化器的选择，可以放松凸性假设，并成功应用于强化学习中的策略优化问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of
probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with
respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of
solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize
the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play
flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the
degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the
regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In
particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex
functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with
respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of
its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer
for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best
Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by
the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with
arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely
how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a
specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these
results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy
optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax
parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.

Motivation: 尽管随机梯度方法在实践中表现优异且易于实现，但其理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在非光滑（强）凸函数情况下。

Method: 通过分析随机重排（RR）和单次重排（SS）策略，改进了非光滑（强）凸函数情况下的收敛性理论。

Result: 证明了RR和SS策略在非光滑（强）凸函数情况下比Proximal GD更快，并给出了RR采样方案下后缀平均的（近乎）最优收敛结果。

Conclusion: 本文首次展示了随机性在非光滑优化中的优势，为随机梯度方法的理论分析提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular
algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in
which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one
whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In
contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the
theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu & Zhou,
2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various
settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex
optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions
are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved
last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used
Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies
are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of
randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal
convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling
scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et
al., 2022).

Conclusion: OSGM不仅提供了一种新的优化方法家族，还解释了超梯度下降在机器学习优化中的成功。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled
gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt
stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the
effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence
measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning
algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that
are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable
convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1)
trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an
improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local
superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order
methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated
quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the
popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.

Abstract: Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity
optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional
modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in
real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks
and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional
modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing
it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining
theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness
partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm,
enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness.
Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and
high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on
unbalanced datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网中，传统的集中式或纯本地学习方法因规模大、移动性高和数据分布不均而受限，需要一种更高效的方法来提升安全消息分类的准确性。

Method: 采用分布式联邦学习（DFL），车辆通过一跳邻居交换模型更新并通过多跳传播模型，使用VeReMi扩展数据集进行验证。

Result: DFL显著提高了所有车辆的分类准确性，尤其是低准确性车辆；同时发现局部数据量和网络连通性对模型准确性有重要影响。DFL在多域攻击（如无线干扰和数据投毒）下表现出脆弱性。

Conclusion: DFL在车联网中具有潜力，但需更鲁棒的策略以应对多域攻击，确保安全性。

Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message
classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous
behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data
collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale,
high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle
networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed
Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning
models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating
models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi)
Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification
accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data.
Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains
through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network.
We further show that local training data size and time-varying network
connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We
investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple
domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our
results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when
confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust
strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的多智能体制造系统控制架构，以动态应对实时干扰，提升系统韧性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造环境因需求变化和产品生命周期缩短而变得复杂且不可预测，传统控制方法在动态工业环境中响应能力有限，需要更先进的策略。

Method: 采用大语言模型赋能的多智能体系统架构，通过分散决策和上下文感知能力动态探索资源能力。

Result: 仿真案例研究表明，该架构提高了系统韧性和灵活性，吞吐量和资源利用率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 大语言模型为多智能体制造系统提供了动态适应和高效资源利用的新途径。

Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to
factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This
complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions.
Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control
strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate
limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent
systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making,
enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However,
current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time
adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of
resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to
overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities.
This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for
multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities
in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study
demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and
flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient
resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 研究稀疏和密集通信拓扑如何影响多智能体系统的协作效率与效果，填补现有研究对拓扑稀疏性作用理解的不足。

Method: 提出因果框架分析不同稀疏度拓扑下智能体输出的传播特性，并设计EIB-learner方法，融合密集和稀疏图的连接模式。

Conclusion: EIB-learner通过平衡错误抑制和信息传播，显著提升了多智能体系统的协作性能。

Abstract: The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems
fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping
both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While
recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct
sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and
dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a
causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous,
propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal
that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation
while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal
task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design
approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial
information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and
sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness,
communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.

Motivation: 电子商务的快速增长和对高效最后一英里配送的需求推动了协作物流的研究，尤其是如何克服无人机和机器人在负载、续航和电池方面的限制。

Method: 研究将问题建模为混合整数线性规划（MILP），并提出启发式算法FINDER以解决大规模实例的计算挑战。

Conclusion: VRP-DR模型和FINDER算法为协作物流提供了高效、近优的解决方案，展示了多平台协同配送的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely,
cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative
logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized
multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a
fleet of $\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\mathcal{K}$ robots,
cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the
launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby
addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited
range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic
features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)
flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic
and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)
en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being
transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle
transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational
challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,
FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to
provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various
instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in
terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate
significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode
and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also
provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility,
drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.

TL;DR: 研究具有前馈神经网络（FFNN）静态非线性反馈的Lur'e形式非线性系统的局部稳定性，提出两种估计吸引域（ROA）的方法，并验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非线性系统在FFNN反馈下的局部稳定性，改进现有方法的保守性和可扩展性。

Method: 1. 基于Lyapunov的方法，构造满足线性矩阵不等式（LMI）的二次函数不变子集；2. 通过逐层传播线性松弛计算FFNN的紧局部扇形边界，结合局部Aizerman框架验证稳定性。

Result: 数值结果表明，在吸引域大小和可扩展性上显著优于现有积分二次约束方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了非线性系统局部稳定性的分析和计算效率。

Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with
static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By
leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the
Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential
stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we
develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i)
a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel
sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and
(ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via
layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into
the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability.
Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral
quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.

Motivation: 现有电池退化模型缺乏准确性和通用性，需开发一种能平衡用户偏好（电池健康与收益）的V2G方法。

Method: 使用ICNN构建数据驱动的电池退化模型，结合多目标优化框架生成个性化充电策略。

Result: ICNN模型在预测电池退化方面表现高精度，优化框架能有效平衡收益与电池健康。

Conclusion: 该方法通过用户偏好驱动的优化策略，实现了V2G收益与电池健康的有效权衡。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology
based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G
revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and
generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on
extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture
nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining
convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property
ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally
efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model
into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart
charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off
between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation,
controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery
health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in
predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off
curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery
health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging
strategies under realistic scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的非绝热耦合（NAC）描述符和相位校正方法，显著提高了NAC的预测精度（R²>0.99），并成功应用于ML驱动的FSSH模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非绝热耦合（NACs）在光化学和光物理过程模拟中至关重要，但传统方法难以准确学习其向量性和双值特性，尤其是在锥形交叉附近。

Method: 设计了NAC专用描述符，并结合新的机器学习相位校正方法，实现了高精度预测。

Result: 在fulvene的ML-FSSH模拟中，准确描述了S₁衰减，并通过大量轨迹减少了误差。

Conclusion: 该方法为加速光化学模拟提供了高效且稳健的解决方案，相关实现已开源。

Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical
and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used
fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive
to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is
challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity
near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific
descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning
NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to
success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the
efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully
ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic
structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of
$S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large
ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source
MLatom.

TL;DR: TailorSQL利用历史查询负载中的信息改进NL2SQL的准确性和延迟，相比传统方法提升2倍执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL技术未利用历史查询负载中的隐含信息（如常见连接路径和表/列语义），而这些信息对翻译准确性至关重要。

Method: TailorSQL通过分析历史查询负载，提取有用信息（如常见连接路径和表/列语义），并结合预训练大语言模型生成SQL查询。

Result: 在标准化基准测试中，TailorSQL的执行准确性提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: TailorSQL证明了利用历史查询负载信息可以显著提升NL2SQL的性能，为智能数据应用提供了更高效的基础。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.

Motivation: 随着上下文长度增加，KV缓存的内存开销和延迟问题日益突出，需要高效的缓存管理方法。

Method: KVzip利用LLM量化KV对的重要性，通过压缩和淘汰低重要性KV对来优化缓存。

Result: KVzip将KV缓存大小减少3-4倍，解码延迟降低约2倍，性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: KVzip在多查询场景下表现优异，显著优于现有方法，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value
(KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand,
leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This
paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling
effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip
quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct
original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower
importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV
cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately
2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval,
reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models
such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching
up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV
eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache
budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.

Result: MAGIC在图像保真度和诊断准确性上表现优异，双盲研究验证了其临床潜力。

Conclusion: MAGIC有望实现无对比剂、低成本且快速的灌注成像，革新医疗领域。

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced
neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's
visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared
to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,
MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering
contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool
- Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering
meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale
genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective
optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously
maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological
domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine
inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom
linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features,
and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative
candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of
Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass
index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a
biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto
fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both
ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets
for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant
biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework,
StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in
complex traits.

Motivation: 开发者通常优先测试无异常的正常路径，而忽视异常行为测试，导致代码对异常事件的处理不充分。

Method: exLong利用基于CodeLlama微调的大型语言模型（LLM），结合异常抛出路径、条件表达式保护和非异常行为测试的分析。

Result: exLong能有效帮助开发者生成全面的异常行为测试，填补测试覆盖的空白。

Conclusion: exLong为开发者提供了一种自动化工具，以更全面地测试代码的异常处理能力。

Abstract: Exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) are crucial in software development for

CodeLlama and incorporates reasoning about exception-throwing traces,
conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional
behavior tests that execute similar traces. Our demonstration video illustrates
how exLong can effectively assist developers in creating comprehensive EBTs for

TL;DR: SWE-bench-Live是一个动态更新的基准测试，旨在解决现有静态基准（如SWE-bench）的局限性，通过自动化流程和实时数据支持更严格的LLM评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如SWE-bench）存在更新滞后、覆盖范围窄和依赖人工的问题，限制了其扩展性和抗数据污染能力。

Method: 提出SWE-bench-Live，包含1,319个来自2024年GitHub问题的任务，并采用自动化流程（\method）生成Docker镜像以确保可复现性。

Result: 实验显示，即使在受控条件下，现有LLM和代理框架在动态基准上的表现显著低于静态基准。

Conclusion: SWE-bench-Live为动态、真实的软件开发环境提供了抗污染、多样化的评估工具，有助于更严格的LLM能力测试。

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world
bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become
standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了研究软件的重要性，并评估了指令调优大语言模型在软件元数据身份解析任务中的表现，旨在提升生命科学研究软件的FAIR性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究软件在科研中至关重要，但关注度不足。通过整合和分析软件元数据，可以更好地理解软件开发与可持续性。

Method: 利用指令调优的大语言模型进行软件元数据身份解析，并通过与人工标注的金标准对比，评估模型性能。

Result: 提出了一种基于一致性的高置信度自动化决策代理，具有高精度和统计稳健性，但也揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 自动化语义判断在跨注册表和存储库的FAIR对齐软件元数据中仍面临挑战，需进一步改进模型和方法。

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

*Manish Shetty,Naman Jain,Jinjian Liu,Vijay Kethanaboyina,Koushik Sen,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GSO是一个用于评估语言模型在高性能软件开发中能力的基准测试，通过自动化流程生成性能测试并分析代码库历史，识别优化任务。现有SWE-Agents表现不佳，成功率低于5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能软件需要专业知识，但现有语言模型在此任务上表现不足，因此需要建立基准以评估和改进其能力。

Method: 开发自动化管道生成性能测试，分析代码库历史以识别优化任务，提供代码库和性能测试作为规范，要求代理提升运行时效率。

Result: 领先的SWE-Agents成功率低于5%，推理时间扩展也未能显著改善表现。定性分析揭示了低级别语言、懒惰优化策略和瓶颈定位等关键失败模式。

Conclusion: GSO基准测试揭示了语言模型在高性能软件开发中的局限性，为未来研究提供了代码和轨迹数据。

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires
specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language
models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an
automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze
repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks
across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our
benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于测试时迭代优化的框架，通过执行沙箱的反馈改进LLM生成的代码效率，并比较了三种训练策略，发现GRPO（基于强化学习）效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码功能正确但效率不足，影响了实际部署，因此需要一种方法在测试时优化代码效率。

Method: 采用闭环系统，LLM根据执行沙箱的反馈迭代优化代码，比较了SFT、DPO和GRPO三种训练策略。

Result: GRPO显著提升了代码效率（pass@1从47%增至62%，效率超越人类提交的概率从31%增至45%）。

Conclusion: 强化学习（GRPO）能有效提升LLM代码效率，展示了RL在LLM自我优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but
often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world
deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative
optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where
LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an
execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy
Optimization~(GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark
show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO,
using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously
optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to
62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from
31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency
improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly
self-improve code efficiency.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文通过快速三级综述分析了AI治理的框架、原则和机制，发现欧盟AI法案和NIST RMF是最常引用的框架，透明度和问责制是最常见的原则，但缺乏可操作的治理机制和利益相关者策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI治理文献缺乏对框架和实践的综合分析，因此需要识别文献中强调的框架、原则、机制和利益相关者角色。

Method: 对2020-2024年间IEEE和ACM的9篇同行评审二级研究进行快速三级综述，采用结构化纳入标准和主题语义合成。

Result: 最常引用的框架是欧盟AI法案和NIST RMF；透明度和问责制是最常见原则；但很少有研究详细说明可操作的治理机制或利益相关者策略。

Conclusion: 综述整合了AI治理的关键方向，并指出了实证验证和包容性方面的不足，为学术研究和组织实践提供了参考。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance is the practice of establishing
frameworks, policies, and procedures to ensure the responsible, ethical, and
safe development and deployment of AI systems. Although AI governance is a core
pillar of Responsible AI, current literature still lacks synthesis across such
governance frameworks and practices. Objective: To identify which frameworks,
principles, mechanisms, and stakeholder roles are emphasized in secondary
literature on AI governance. Method: We conducted a rapid tertiary review of
nine peer-reviewed secondary studies from IEEE and ACM (20202024), using
structured inclusion criteria and thematic semantic synthesis. Results: The
most cited frameworks include the EU AI Act and NIST RMF; transparency and
accountability are the most common principles. Few reviews detail actionable
governance mechanisms or stakeholder strategies. Conclusion: The review
consolidates key directions in AI governance and highlights gaps in empirical
validation and inclusivity. Findings inform both academic inquiry and practical
adoption in organizations.

### [422] [From Knowledge to Noise: CTIM-Rover and the Pitfalls of Episodic Memory in Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23422)
*Tobias Lindenbauer,Georg Groh,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CTIM-Rover是一个基于AutoCodeRover的AI代理，通过引入跨任务实例记忆（CTIM）扩展了代理推理框架，但实验表明其性能未超越AutoCodeRover。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源软件工程代理在任务完成后丢弃长期记忆，而仓库级理解对修复漏洞至关重要，因此研究CTIM的潜力。

Method: 基于Experiential Learning（ExpeL）和Mixture-Of-Experts（MoEs）方法，构建通用和仓库级的CTIM。

Result: CTIM-Rover在所有配置中均未超越AutoCodeRover，性能下降可能由CTIM中的噪声或干扰项引起。

Conclusion: ExpeL和DoT-Bank方法无法扩展到实际软件工程问题，CTIM的引入未带来预期效果。

Abstract: We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on
top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning
frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and
repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source
SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning
frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task
instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all
locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is
particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the
Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a
Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose
and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform
AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor
DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis
indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories
as the likely source of the performance degradation.

Conclusion: 该系统在复杂环境中实现了高效的语义探索和目标映射，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense
semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot
equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often
struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view
angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we
propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the
task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation.
We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel
Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This
enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without
unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to
ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive
Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while
ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic
target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM
algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our
approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and
complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner
achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a
specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further
confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object
mapping of unstructured environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和RRT的混合路径规划方法VLM-RRT，旨在解决传统RRT在高复杂度搜索空间中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路径规划方法（如RRT）在高复杂度环境中存在搜索效率低、路径质量差和收敛慢的问题，尤其在灾难响应等关键应用中表现不足。

Method: 提出VLM-RRT，利用VLM的环境识别能力为RRT提供初始方向指导，从而优化采样效率和路径质量。

Result: 实验证明，VLM-RRT显著提高了采样效率和路径质量。

Conclusion: VLM-RRT是一种有效的路径规划改进方法，适用于复杂环境中的高效导航。

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), enabling them to efficiently navigate toward a target region
or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional
pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven
effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search
space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that
are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster
response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these
limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language
Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths
of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on
environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely
to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path
quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various
state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

Motivation: 传统计算机视觉系统在开放世界中难以识别陌生物体或推断其任务相关性，而LLMs虽能提供有用见解，但也容易产生幻觉或误导性建议。

Method: 设计、模拟并实际集成了认知护栏，用于sUAS群在搜救任务中的决策。

Result: 通过认知护栏，sUAS群能够在不确定环境下做出安全且合理的决策。

Conclusion: 认知护栏是确保LLMs在sUAS群任务规划中安全应用的关键。

Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these
settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and
autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often
struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer
their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large
language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications.
While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations
and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure
safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must
be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design,
simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in
search-and-rescue missions.

Result: 该方法无需重新训练或微调即可集成到现有工作流程中，结合视觉语言基础模型在特征空间中比较像素，实现了准确的异常检测。

Conclusion: 该研究为越野导航中的异常检测提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法。

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb
control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in
dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged
mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise
coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified
reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills
involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and
striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes
real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between
simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors.
Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement
learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification
techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a
variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock
trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise
strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged
mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Conclusion: 策略迁移方法通过优化基座姿态，无需额外训练即可提升策略的泛化能力，与现有方法兼容。

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.

TL;DR: 论文通过理论分析解释了Q学习代理在无限重复博弈中可能学会收取超竞争价格的行为，并引入了一类新的单记忆子博弈完美均衡（SPEs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验证据表明Q学习代理可能学会收取超竞争价格，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究无限重复博弈中，企业仅基于观察到的利润更新定价策略，不计算均衡策略。分析了Q函数在实验结束时满足特定不等式时的行为。

Result: 当博弈同时存在单阶段纳什均衡价格和合谋促成价格时，企业学会持续收取超竞争价格。引入了新的单记忆SPEs，并分析了支持天真合谋、冷酷触发策略或递增策略的条件。

Conclusion: 天真合谋仅在合谋促成价格为单阶段纳什均衡时才构成SPE，而冷酷触发策略可以支持SPE。

Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to
charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation
for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing
policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium
strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium
price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies
certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently
charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame
perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior
is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing
strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the

*Antonio Ocello,Daniil Tiapkin,Lorenzo Mancini,Mathieu Laurière,Eric Moulines*

Main category: stat.ML

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将强化学习中的TRPO方法扩展到平均场博弈框架，以解决复杂多智能体问题。

Method: 基于TRPO的方法论，在MFG框架下进行策略优化，提供算法精确和样本形式的理论分析。

Result: 证明了MF-TRPO的收敛性，并给出了高概率保证和有限样本复杂度。

Conclusion: MF-TRPO通过结合RL技术和平均场决策，为复杂多智能体问题提供了理论支持的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel
algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic
Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the
well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL)
setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its
stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in
the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing
theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact
formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive
high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances
MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making,
offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent
problems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）转化为多核布尔参数，并直接在布尔域中进行微调，避免了昂贵的潜在权重，显著降低了复杂度和性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有权重二值化方法存在信息损失或依赖高精度潜在权重的问题，导致性能不佳或复杂度高。

Method: 提出一种新框架，将LLMs转化为多核布尔参数，直接在布尔域中微调，无需潜在权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种LLMs上优于现有的超低位量化和二值化方法。

Conclusion: 新方法显著降低了复杂度和性能损失，为LLMs的二值化提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce
the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into
two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware
binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to
significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor
performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on
full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights,
which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs
into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them
directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent
weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and
inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of
LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit
quantization and binarization methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Deep Copula Classifier (DCC) 是一种生成模型，通过神经网络的参数化 copula 分离特征边际分布和联合依赖结构的学习，适用于复杂依赖驱动的分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类器假设特征独立或依赖过于简化的关系，导致在现实依赖场景中表现不佳。DCC 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DCC 使用轻量级神经网络灵活捕捉特征交互，并通过 copula 建模依赖结构。支持高维扩展、半监督学习和在线适应。

Result: DCC 在标准条件下收敛到贝叶斯最优分类器，收敛速率为 O(n^{-r/(2r + d)})。

Conclusion: DCC 结合统计严谨性和神经网络表达能力，为依赖感知分类提供了数学基础和可解释框架。

Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.

*Eshant English,Christoph Lippert*

TL;DR: JAPAN提出了一种基于密度的共形预测框架，通过流模型估计密度并构建预测区域，解决了传统残差方法在多模态分布下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形预测方法依赖残差分数，难以处理多模态分布，导致预测区域过于保守且无法捕捉复杂分布的真实形状。

Method: JAPAN利用流模型估计密度，通过阈值化密度分数构建紧凑、可能不连续的预测区域，保持有限样本覆盖保证。

Result: 在多元回归和预测任务中，JAPAN表现出良好的校准性和更紧凑的预测区域，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: JAPAN通过密度分数改进了共形预测的效率和灵活性，适用于复杂分布场景。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty
quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive
tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches
commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric
constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In
particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred
around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive
distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction
Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses
density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN
estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by
thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially
disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage
guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically
validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating
good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines.
We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed
framework.

*Budhaditya Halder,Shubhayan Pan,Koulik Khamaru*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Thompson Sampling（TS）算法，称为Stable Thompson Sampling，通过增加对数因子的后验方差，解决了TS在统计推断中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling（TS）虽然渐近最优且实证有效，但其自适应采样机制对模型参数的置信区间构建提出了挑战。

Method: 提出Stable Thompson Sampling，通过增加对数因子的后验方差来稳定估计。

Result: 改进后的算法能够生成渐近正态的臂均值估计，且仅以对数因子增加遗憾。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在自适应决策算法中，通过小幅增加遗憾代价，可以实现有效的统计推断。

Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected
via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known
to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive
sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for
model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable
Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic
factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates
of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this
statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases
regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal
a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid
statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.

*Adrien Majka,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了Goodhart定律在机器学习中的形式化，特别是代理指标与目标之间的耦合关系对定律的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goodhart定律在政策制定中广为人知，但在机器学习中缺乏形式化研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，并放宽先前研究的独立性假设。

Method: 通过放宽独立性假设和学习范式假设，研究代理指标与目标之间的耦合关系对Goodhart定律的影响。

Result: 在轻尾目标和轻尾差异情况下，依赖性不改变Goodhart效应的本质；但在轻尾目标和重尾差异情况下，过度优化的速率与差异的重尾性成反比。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了代理指标与目标之间的耦合关系对Goodhart定律的具体影响，为机器学习中的优化提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning
models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical
evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however
being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's
law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a
proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we
alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and
the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the
effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on
Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and
light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's
effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we
exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely
proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and
the metric. %

Motivation: 探讨偏好反馈如何提升语言模型的参数估计性能。

Method: 提出基于偏好的M估计器，利用确定性偏好揭示的硬约束，设计了一种估计器。

Result: 该估计器的估计误差达到O(1/n)，显著优于仅基于样本的Θ(1/√n)速率。

Conclusion: 在特定假设下（如高斯或拉普拉斯分布），偏好反馈能显著加速参数估计。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference
feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions
under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of
continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes
pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative
preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that
preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than
sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences.
Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we
propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of
$\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$
rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that
matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants.
While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are
satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for
preferences based on the log-probability reward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视相干成像中的乘性噪声（散斑）降低了图像质量，但其理论基础尚未充分探索。

Method: 结合投影梯度下降（PGD）和牛顿-舒尔茨算法计算矩阵逆，并采用bagging策略减少投影误差。

Result: 首次建立了最大似然估计在深度图像先验假设下的MSE理论上界，算法性能达到领先水平。

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架和算法为多视相干成像提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as
digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central
challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly
known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of
coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively
underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic
aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,
providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our
theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper
bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under
the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on
the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the
signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic
side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for
computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key
ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the
Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,
significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging
strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We
demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在给定样本的情况下，最小化真实离散分布与估计之间的KL散度，同时考虑差分隐私约束。

Method: 构建了极小极大最优的私有估计器，并提出了基于Good-Turing估计器的算法，实现了实例最优性。

Result: 在局部邻域内，算法实现了常数倍的实例最优性，且适用于差分隐私和非隐私场景。

Conclusion: 通过改进局部邻域的定义，论文在KL散度下更精确地刻画了分布估计的难度，并提出了高效的估计方法。

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete
distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the
distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the
true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax
optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on
an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and
simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on
real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality
viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum
achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under
natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve
instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential
privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the
Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that
more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL
divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.

TL;DR: Muon是一种专门优化矩阵结构参数的优化器，实验表明其性能优于传统优化器，但理论理解有限。本文分析了Muon的收敛性及其优于梯度下降的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器将矩阵参数视为扁平化向量，可能忽略其结构特性。Muon针对矩阵结构设计，但缺乏理论支持其优越性能的原因。

Method: 对Muon进行收敛速率分析，并与梯度下降（GD）比较，探讨Muon优于GD的条件。

Result: 理论表明Muon能从Hessian矩阵的低秩和近似块对角结构中受益，实验支持了这一发现。

Conclusion: Muon在特定条件下优于GD，其性能提升与Hessian矩阵的结构特性密切相关。

Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as
matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters
as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their
inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been
proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters.
Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform
traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the
theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind
its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a
comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with
Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon
can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from
the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices
-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our
experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估范式忽视置信度误差对齐和操作稳定性，AURORA旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 发现现有方法在分布偏移下置信度不可靠，影响操作信任和效率。

Conclusion: 需重新设计评估方法，提升恶意软件分类器的操作稳定性。

Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear
promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The
standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics,
neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While
TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a
complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain
reliable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the
tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not.
We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their
confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence
profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its
estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste
valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and
leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is
further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time
performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational
stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in
state-of-the-art frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests
the need for a return to the whiteboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速发展，AI生成的内容可能被用于制造虚假信息。尽管法规要求标注AI生成内容，但其实际效果尚不明确。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过定性焦点小组探讨用户对AI标签的看法，随后通过预注册的在线调查（1300多名欧美参与者）定量评估标签对识别虚假信息的影响。

Result: 焦点小组显示用户认为标签有助于识别AI生成内容，但调查发现标签可能导致用户过度依赖，甚至降低对准确信息的信任，同时提升人工生成虚假信息的可信度。

Conclusion: AI标签虽有一定效果，但需谨慎设计以避免副作用，如用户过度依赖或对人工内容的信任偏差。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans'
interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to
create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed
regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only
little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated
misinformation.
  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we
study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling.
Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the
successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users'
opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we
conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants
to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize
misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus
groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical
implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying
AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security
benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might
over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated
images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief
in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated
image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images
conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of
labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CaMeL虽然有效，但假设用户提示可信，忽略了侧信道问题，且因双LLM设计导致性能折衷。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出四项改进：(1)初始输入的提示筛查，(2)输出审计以检测指令泄漏，(3)分层风险访问模型，(4)带形式化保证的验证中间语言。

Result: 改进后的CaMeL更符合企业安全最佳实践，支持可扩展部署。

Conclusion: 通过工程改进，CaMeL的威胁覆盖和实用性得到显著提升。

Abstract: CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based
sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM)
agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits
side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM
design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering
improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We
introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to
detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability
and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees.
Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security
and support scalable deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出Permissioned LLMs（PermLLM），通过在LLM查询响应中叠加组织数据访问控制结构，解决企业环境中数据隔离和访问控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业数据通常被隔离和保护，但LLM微调后可能破坏访问控制结构，因此需要一种机制确保查询响应符合权限要求。

Method: 提出PermLLM机制，基于参数高效微调（PEFT）实现访问控制，并引入相关响应概念和访问优势（access advantage）指标。

Result: 通过四个公共数据集（GPQA、RCV1、SimpleQA、WMDP）验证了PermLLM机制的有效性，并评估了DDI和UGI指标的实用性。

Conclusion: PermLLM成功实现了数据访问控制的正确执行，并通过实验验证了其机制和指标的有效性。

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and
carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access
control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed
data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate
access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs
that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query
responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to
determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query
responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can
be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We
also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate
the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM
mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired
access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access
advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership
Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility
evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through
extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP),
in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for
quantifying access control in LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，定制化LLM显著提高了验证效率和灵活性，并建立了硬件漏洞数据库。

Conclusion: BugWhisperer框架为SoC安全验证提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，并支持后续研究。

Abstract: The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces
challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These
issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making
bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper
proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized,
fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing
the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text
inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the
adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an
open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security
vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM
effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security
verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware
vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the
research community in enhancing the security verification process.

TL;DR: 论文提出AgentAlign框架，通过抽象行为链合成安全对齐数据，显著提升LLM代理的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理能力的提升增加了恶意使用的风险，现有方法在安全对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 利用抽象行为链在模拟环境中生成真实且可执行的指令，同时合成良性指令以平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在AgentHarm评估中，安全性能提升35.8%至79.5%，且实用性影响极小或有所提升。

Conclusion: AgentAlign框架有效解决了LLM代理的安全对齐问题，同时保持了模型的高实用性。

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

TL;DR: AdvOF是一种针对视觉与语言导航（VLN）代理的新型攻击框架，通过生成对抗性3D对象，研究其对VLM感知模块的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击未考虑服务计算环境中的可靠性和服务质量（QoS），AdvOF填补了这一空白，探索了VLM在关键服务流程中的脆弱性。

Method: AdvOF通过精确聚合和对齐2D与3D空间中的目标对象位置，定义并渲染对抗性对象，并通过多视角优化和正则化协同优化对抗性与目标对象的物理属性和VLM感知。

Result: 实验表明，AdvOF能有效降低代理在对抗条件下的性能，同时最小化对正常导航任务的干扰。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对VLM驱动导航系统服务安全的理解，为物理世界部署中的鲁棒服务组合提供了计算基础。

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理自主性和能力的提升，确保其安全性（如防止提示注入漏洞）变得至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个形式化模型，用于分析代理规划器的安全性和表达能力，并构建了动态污点跟踪的分类法。在此基础上，设计了Fides规划器，支持机密性和完整性标签跟踪。

Conclusion: 信息流控制为AI代理提供了有效的安全保障，Fides规划器展示了其在实际任务中的潜力。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable, ensuring their
security against vulnerabilities such as prompt injection becomes critical.
This paper explores the use of information-flow control (IFC) to provide
security guarantees for AI agents. We present a formal model to reason about
the security and expressiveness of agent planners. Using this model, we
characterize the class of properties enforceable by dynamic taint-tracking and
construct a taxonomy of tasks to evaluate security and utility trade-offs of
planner designs. Informed by this exploration, we present Fides, a planner that
tracks confidentiality and integrity labels, deterministically enforces
security policies, and introduces novel primitives for selectively hiding
information. Its evaluation in AgentDojo demonstrates that this approach
broadens the range of tasks that can be securely accomplished. A tutorial to
walk readers through the the concepts introduced in the paper can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密码学方法在AI系统中可能过于复杂且不高效，需要一种轻量级且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for secure and privacy-preserving
neural network inference based on keyed chaotic dynamical transformations. The
proposed method applies a deterministic, cryptographically seeded chaotic
system to tensors, producing non-invertible, user-specific transformations that
enable authenticated inference, tensor-level watermarking, and data
attribution. This framework offers a scalable and lightweight alternative to
conventional cryptographic techniques, and establishes a new direction for
tensor-level security in AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的贝叶斯视角下的数据重构概念，并基于此提出了一种新的安全定义，在某些情况下可证明防止重构攻击。作者还重新审视了指纹码攻击（FPC），认为其本质上是成员推理攻击而非重构攻击，并指出若仅防止重构攻击（而非成员推理攻击），则FPC的不可能性结果在某些情况下不再适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数据重构的贝叶斯视角，并提出一种新的安全定义以防止重构攻击，同时重新分析指纹码攻击（FPC）的本质。

Method: 采用贝叶斯视角分析数据重构，提出新的安全定义，并通过理论分析重新分类FPC攻击。

Result: 证明了在某些情况下，新的安全定义可防止重构攻击，并指出FPC攻击实为成员推理攻击，其不可能性结果在仅防止重构攻击时不再适用。

Conclusion: 本文为数据重构提供了新的理论视角，并澄清了FPC攻击的本质，为隐私保护领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We introduce a new Bayesian perspective on the concept of data
reconstruction, and leverage this viewpoint to propose a new security
definition that, in certain settings, provably prevents reconstruction attacks.
We use our paradigm to shed new light on one of the most notorious attacks in
the privacy and memorization literature - fingerprinting code attacks (FPC). We
argue that these attacks are really a form of membership inference attacks,
rather than reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we show that if the goal is
solely to prevent reconstruction (but not membership inference), then in some
cases the impossibility results derived from FPC no longer apply.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无分布假设下统计问题的可解性，填补理论与实践的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，刻画无分布假设下凸M估计或随机优化问题的可解条件。

Result: 发现可解问题的分界线，且Lipschitz连续性并非必要条件。

Conclusion: 为无分布假设下的优化问题提供了新的理论框架，区别于传统机器学习中的可学习性特征。

Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are
solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has
long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a
(univariate) convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable
in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between
solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps
surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not
necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from
classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在无向连通图上基于平滑性假设的信号恢复问题，提出了平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器，并给出了非渐近误差界。结果表明，在某些图结构下，即使采样非常稀疏，估计器仍具有弱一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在部分线性测量下，如何利用图的平滑性假设恢复顶点上的潜在信号，尤其是在采样非常稀疏的情况下。

Method: 采用平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器，假设信号在图上具有小的二次变差，通过优化目标函数联合恢复信号。

Result: 获得了非渐近的均方误差界，证明在某些图结构下，即使每个顶点仅测量一个坐标且采样比例趋近于零，估计器仍具有弱一致性。

Conclusion: 平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器在稀疏采样和弱连通图结构下仍能有效恢复信号，扩展了其在多层排序问题中的应用。

Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each
vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given
partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of
the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are
smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over
the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error
for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares
estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this
estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially
very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a
vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a
``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths
of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are
obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency
is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are
very sparse and disconnected.

Motivation: 解决kNN算法在面对大数据时的时间复杂度高的问题。

Result: 显著降低了kNN算法的时间复杂度。

Conclusion: GB-QkNN算法通过粒球和量子化结合，有效提升了kNN的效率。

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have
made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large
amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm
called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves
higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data
size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the
time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via
quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search
process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW
method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and
significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as
revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data,
designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information
remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to
be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While
there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence
for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding
tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the
classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness
of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree
polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree
hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for
learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it
to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a
challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To
our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework
was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree
hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with
single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and
identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for
protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity
landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more
entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning
Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of
classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection
to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling
constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack
rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control
framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while
providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online
conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation
sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum
magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the
required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The
results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum
algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing
on NISQ devices.

### [1] [Meaning Is Not A Metric: Using LLMs to make cultural context legible at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23785)
*Cody Kommers,Drew Hemment,Maria Antoniak,Joel Z. Leibo,Hoyt Long,Emily Robinson,Adam Sobey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文主张利用大语言模型（LLMs）通过“厚描述”在AI系统中捕捉文化背景和人类意义，解决传统“薄描述”标准化导致的意义缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统依赖数值化的“薄描述”，无法保留文化背景和人类意义。人文和社科领域的“厚描述”虽能有效表达意义，但难以规模化应用。LLMs的出现为自动化生成和处理“厚描述”提供了可能。

Method: 提出将LLMs的文本能力与“厚描述”框架结合，以解决文化背景和人类意义的表达问题。

Result: LLMs可以部分自动化“厚描述”的生成和处理，克服规模化瓶颈，但需解决五大挑战：保留上下文、维护解释多元性、整合经验与批判视角、区分质与量、承认意义的动态性。

Conclusion: “厚描述”可作为统一框架，解决LLMs中文化表达的难题，是生成AI应用的重要方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make
cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented
scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have
previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin
descriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and
therefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.
By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have
developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal
representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual
information needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can
effectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the
verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)
automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially
overcoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human
meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about
developing new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame
this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify
five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,
integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,
distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and
acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest
that thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to
address a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing
culture in (or using) LLMs.

### [2] [Nine Ways to Break Copyright Law and Why Our LLM Won't: A Fair Use Aligned Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23788)
*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Priyansh Srivastava,Sundar Atreya H.,Shirish Karande,Mohan Kankanhalli,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FUA-LLM框架通过法律依据和优化方法减少大语言模型（LLM）的版权侵权风险，同时保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM常因直接复制受保护内容而面临侵权问题，现有方法多以拒绝为主，实用性受限。

Method: 开发FairUseDB数据集，结合DPO优化方法，训练LLM生成合法且实用的替代内容。

Result: FUA-LLM显著减少侵权输出（达20%），同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: FUA-LLM为LLM版权问题提供了法律合规且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly risk copyright infringement by
reproducing protected content verbatim or with insufficient transformative
modifications, posing significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns.
Current inference-time safeguards predominantly rely on restrictive
refusal-based filters, often compromising the practical utility of these
models. To address this, we collaborated closely with intellectual property
experts to develop FUA-LLM (Fair Use Aligned Language Models), a
legally-grounded framework explicitly designed to align LLM outputs with
fair-use doctrine. Central to our method is FairUseDB, a carefully constructed
dataset containing 18,000 expert-validated examples covering nine realistic
infringement scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, encouraging them to produce
legally compliant and practically useful alternatives rather than resorting to
blunt refusal. Recognizing the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics,
we propose new measures: Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic
Mean (CAH) to balance infringement risk against response utility. Extensive
quantitative experiments coupled with expert evaluations confirm that FUA-LLM
substantially reduces problematic outputs (up to 20\%) compared to
state-of-the-art approaches, while preserving real-world usability.

### [3] [Conversational Exploration of Literature Landscape with LitChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23789)
*Mingyu Huang,Shasha Zhou,Yuxuan Chen,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitChat是一个端到端的交互式文献代理，结合数据驱动工具增强LLM代理，帮助用户快速探索大规模文献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统手动文献综述在“大文献”时代不可行的问题，同时克服LLM在系统性综述中的局限性。

Method: LitChat通过自动解析用户查询、检索相关文献、构建知识图谱，并运用数据挖掘技术生成基于证据的见解。

Result: 通过AI4Health案例研究展示了LitChat快速导航大规模文献的能力。

Conclusion: LitChat为文献探索提供了高效、数据驱动的解决方案，弥补了传统方法和LLM的不足。

Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where the volume of digital
scientific publications is growing exponentially. While offering new
opportunities, this also poses challenges for understanding literature
landscapes, as traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible. Recent large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities for literature
comprehension, yet they are incapable of offering "comprehensive, objective,
open and transparent" views desired by systematic reviews due to their limited
context windows and trust issues like hallucinations. Here we present LitChat,
an end-to-end, interactive and conversational literature agent that augments
LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature
exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant
sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining
techniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs. We
illustrate the effectiveness of LitChat via a case study on AI4Health,
highlighting its capacity to quickly navigate the users through large-scale
literature landscape with data-based evidence that is otherwise infeasible with
traditional means.

### [4] [Rethinking the Understanding Ability across LLMs through Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23790)
*Shaojie Wang,Sirui Ding,Na Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互信息（MI）的信息理论框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的内在语言理解能力，并通过实验验证了编码器模型在信息保真度上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但评估其内在语言理解能力仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过互信息（MI）量化输入句子与其潜在表示之间的信息保留程度，并分解为词级MI，利用Fano不等式推导可计算的下界。

Result: 实验表明，编码器模型在信息保真度上优于解码器模型，且通过优化词级可恢复性可以提升模型的理解能力。

Conclusion: 互信息可作为评估和提升语言模型能力的理论基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural
language processing, yet evaluating their intrinsic linguistic understanding
remains challenging. Moving beyond specialized evaluation tasks, we propose an
information-theoretic framework grounded in mutual information (MI) to achieve
this. We formalize the understanding as MI between an input sentence and its
latent representation (sentence-level MI), measuring how effectively input
information is preserved in latent representation. Given that LLMs learn
embeddings for individual tokens, we decompose sentence-level MI into
token-level MI between tokens and sentence embeddings, establishing theoretical
bounds connecting these measures. Based on this foundation, we theoretically
derive a computable lower bound for token-level MI using Fano's inequality,
which directly relates to token-level recoverability-the ability to predict
original tokens from sentence embedding. We implement this recoverability task
to comparatively measure MI across different LLMs, revealing that encoder-only
models consistently maintain higher information fidelity than their
decoder-only counterparts, with the latter exhibiting a distinctive late-layer
"forgetting" pattern where mutual information is first enhanced and then
discarded. Moreover, fine-tuning to maximize token-level recoverability
consistently improves understanding ability of LLMs on tasks without
task-specific supervision, demonstrating that mutual information can serve as a
foundation for understanding and improving language model capabilities.

### [5] [R3-RAG: Learning Step-by-Step Reasoning and Retrieval for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23794)
*Yuan Li,Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Bufan Li,Qinyuan Cheng,Bo Wang,Yining Zheng,Yuxin Wang,Zhangyue Yin,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3-RAG通过强化学习让LLM学会逐步推理和检索，提升检索增强生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集检索器在RAG系统中的瓶颈问题，如参数限制和无法逐步推理。

Method: 分两阶段：冷启动学习推理与检索交替，强化学习优化检索能力；设计两种奖励（答案正确性和文档相关性）。

Result: R3-RAG显著优于基线，并能适应不同检索器。

Conclusion: R3-RAG通过强化学习有效提升了RAG系统的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate
hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG
systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to
perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to
address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To
address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses
$\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to
$\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving
comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is
divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the
manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use
reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the
external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for
R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the
trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification
for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are
relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to
iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer.
Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and
can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at
https://github.com/Yuan-Li-FNLP/R3-RAG.

### [6] [Emergent LLM behaviors are observationally equivalent to data leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23796)
*Christopher Barrie,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出Ashery等人的研究结果可能是数据泄露导致，而非LLMs自发形成语言规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑Ashery等人的结论，认为其观察到的行为是LLMs记忆训练数据而非涌现现象。

Method: 通过多种分析证明LLMs识别协调游戏结构并回忆结果，而非形成新规范。

Result: LLMs的行为与记忆训练数据无法区分，未表现出真正涌现的规范。

Conclusion: 建议探索替代策略，并反思LLMs在社会科学模型中的适用性。

Abstract: Ashery et al. recently argue that large language models (LLMs), when paired
to play a classic "naming game," spontaneously develop linguistic conventions
reminiscent of human social norms. Here, we show that their results are better
explained by data leakage: the models simply reproduce conventions they already
encountered during pre-training. Despite the authors' mitigation measures, we
provide multiple analyses demonstrating that the LLMs recognize the structure
of the coordination game and recall its outcomes, rather than exhibit
"emergent" conventions. Consequently, the observed behaviors are
indistinguishable from memorization of the training corpus. We conclude by
pointing to potential alternative strategies and reflecting more generally on
the place of LLMs for social science models.

### [7] [Detection of Suicidal Risk on Social Media: A Hybrid Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23797)
*Zaihan Yang,Ryan Leonard,Hien Tran,Rory Driscoll,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合RoBERTa、TF-IDF和PCA的混合模型，用于通过Reddit帖子自动分类自杀风险严重程度，并展示了优于其他方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀风险早期检测工具的迫切需求，促使研究利用机器学习模型从社交媒体数据中识别自杀风险。

Method: 提出RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA混合模型，结合深度上下文嵌入与统计特征，并通过数据重采样和增强解决数据不平衡和过拟合问题。

Result: 混合模型在加权F1分数上达到0.7512，优于单独使用RoBERTa、BERT及其他传统分类器。

Conclusion: 混合模型在自杀风险分类任务中表现优异，为早期检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical
societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable
early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine
learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into
four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class
classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating
the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa),
a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical
term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy
and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and
overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data
augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we
compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT
model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results
demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a
best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

### [8] [My Answer Is NOT 'Fair': Mitigating Social Bias in Vision-Language Models via Fair and Biased Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23798)
*Jian Lan,Yifei Fu,Udo Schlegel,Gengyuan Zhang,Tanveer Hannan,Haokun Chen,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的社会偏见问题，并提出了一种无需训练的后处理方法以减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会偏见在VLMs中是一个严重问题，可能导致对某些社会群体的不公平和伦理问题。研究旨在评估和缓解这种偏见。

Method: 通过多选任务评估四种先进VLMs在PAIRS和SocialCounterfactuals数据集上的表现，并提出一种后处理方法，通过调整隐藏层残差来减少偏见。

Result: 研究发现VLMs存在性别和种族偏见，且模型对公平性的自信程度与实际表现不符。后处理方法显著提升了公平性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理方法有效减少了VLMs的社会偏见，且无需额外训练，适用于不同模型。

Abstract: Social bias is a critical issue in large vision-language models (VLMs), where
fairness- and ethics-related problems harm certain groups of people in society.
It is unknown to what extent VLMs yield social bias in generative responses. In
this study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the
model's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the
multiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from
generating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models
are prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated
confidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why
VLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit
substantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer
show mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some
lead to increased bias. Based on these findings, we propose a post-hoc method
for the inference stage to mitigate social bias, which is training-free and
model-agnostic. We achieve this by ablating bias-associated residuals while
amplifying fairness-associated residuals on model hidden layers during
inference. We demonstrate that our post-hoc method outperforms the competing
training strategies, helping VLMs have fairer responses and more reliable
confidence levels.

### [9] [Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23799)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Weiran Lin,Omer Akgul,Lujo Bauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）的幻觉问题和提示扰动敏感性，提出了一种基于logit的集成方法来估计LLM的一致性，并通过用户研究表明当前方法在近似人类感知方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM容易产生幻觉且对提示扰动敏感，导致生成文本不一致或不可靠。现有的一致性测量方法未能很好地反映人类对一致性的感知。

Method: 提出了一种基于logit的集成方法，用于估计LLM的一致性，并通过用户研究（n=2,976）验证其效果。

Result: 该方法在估计人类对LLM一致性的评分方面表现最佳，但总体表明无人类评估的方法仍存在不足。

Conclusion: 建议更广泛地使用人类输入来评估LLM的一致性，因为现有无人类评估的方法仍有明显缺陷。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to
prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated
text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and
fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's
confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when
resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often
relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled
responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet
clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency
of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods
typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well.
We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we
show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing
metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that
methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently
imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEMFED是一种针对异构NLP任务的语义感知资源高效联邦学习框架，通过语义感知的客户端选择、自适应模型架构和通信高效的语义特征压缩，显著降低了通信成本并保持了高模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在NLP任务中面临语义异构性、词汇不匹配和边缘设备资源限制等挑战，SEMFED旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SEMFED采用语义感知的客户端选择机制、自适应NLP模型架构和语义特征压缩技术。

Result: 实验表明，SEMFED在NLP分类任务中通信成本降低80.5%，同时模型精度保持在98%以上。

Conclusion: SEMFED能有效管理异构客户端环境，适用于实际联邦NLP部署。

Abstract: Background: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However,
applying FL to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks presents unique
challenges due to semantic heterogeneity across clients, vocabulary mismatches,
and varying resource constraints on edge devices. Objectives: This paper
introduces SEMFED, a novel semantic-aware resource-efficient federated learning
framework specifically designed for heterogeneous NLP tasks. Methods: SEMFED
incorporates three key innovations: (1) a semantic-aware client selection
mechanism that balances semantic diversity with resource constraints, (2)
adaptive NLP-specific model architectures tailored to device capabilities while
preserving semantic information, and (3) a communication-efficient semantic
feature compression technique that significantly reduces bandwidth
requirements. Results: Experimental results on various NLP classification tasks
demonstrate that SEMFED achieves an 80.5% reduction in communication costs
while maintaining model accuracy above 98%, outperforming state-of-the-art FL
approaches. Conclusion: SEMFED effectively manages heterogeneous client
environments with varying computational resources, network reliability, and
semantic data distributions, making it particularly suitable for real-world
federated NLP deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedHELM是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）在医疗任务中表现的可扩展框架，包含临床验证的分类法、全面的基准套件和改进的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法未能充分反映真实临床实践的复杂性和多样性，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含5类、22子类和121任务的分类法，构建了35个基准测试，并采用LLM-jury评估方法进行系统比较和成本性能分析。

Result: 评估显示模型性能差异显著，高级推理模型表现优异，Claude 3.5 Sonnet在较低计算成本下表现相当。LLM-jury方法与临床评分一致性较高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对医疗任务的真实评估的重要性，并提供了开源框架MedHELM以实现这一目标。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical
licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and
diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible
evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three
key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories,
22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly
formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in
the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation
methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9
frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance
variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64%
win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved
comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized
accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note
Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83),
moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in
Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow
(0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with
clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician
agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and
BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top
models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of
real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an
open source framework to enable this.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何为基于LLM的文本到SQL解析提供校准的置信度分数，提出了一种结合子句频率（SCF）和多变量Platt缩放（MPS）的方法，显著提升了校准效果和错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在文本到SQL解析中表现优异，但有时会自信地给出错误答案，因此需要可靠的置信度衡量方法。

Method: 提出子句频率（SCF）评分方法，结合多变量Platt缩放（MPS）技术，将细粒度信号整合为整体校准分数。

Result: 在两个流行的文本到SQL数据集上，该方法在校准和错误检测任务上优于传统Platt缩放。

Conclusion: 结合SCF和MPS的方法显著提升了文本到SQL解析的置信度校准效果，为构建可信赖的系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL
parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are
confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires
eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study
the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the
likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish
a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In
particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration,
provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output
probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for
text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to
provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency"
(SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the
canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an
overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular
text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields
further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection
over traditional Platt scaling.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings faces critical
trade-offs: cloud LLMs, with their extensive parameters and superior
performance, pose risks to sensitive clinical data privacy, while local LLMs
preserve privacy but often fail at complex clinical interpretation tasks. We
propose MedOrchestra, a hybrid framework where a cloud LLM decomposes complex
clinical tasks into manageable subtasks and prompt generation, while a local
LLM executes these subtasks in a privacy-preserving manner. Without accessing
clinical data, the cloud LLM generates and validates subtask prompts using
clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases. The local LLM executes subtasks
locally and synthesizes outputs generated by the cloud LLM. We evaluate
MedOrchestra on pancreatic cancer staging using 100 radiology reports under
NCCN guidelines. On free-text reports, MedOrchestra achieves 70.21% accuracy,
outperforming local model baselines (without guideline: 48.94%, with guideline:
56.59%) and board-certified clinicians (gastroenterologists: 59.57%, surgeons:
65.96%, radiologists: 55.32%). On structured reports, MedOrchestra reaches
85.42% accuracy, showing clear superiority across all settings.

### [14] [DLP: Dynamic Layerwise Pruning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23807)
*Yuli Chen,Bo Cheng,Jiale Han,Yingying Zhang,Yingting Li,Shuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为动态分层剪枝（DLP）的新方法，通过结合模型权重和输入激活信息自适应地确定每层的重要性，从而在高稀疏度下有效保留模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流的分层剪枝方法通常依赖统一的剪枝策略，导致在高稀疏度下性能显著下降。不同层对LLMs的贡献不同，因此需要一种更灵活的方法来优化剪枝效果。

Method: DLP方法动态地评估每层的重要性，结合模型权重和输入激活信息，自适应地分配剪枝率。

Result: 实验表明，DLP在70%稀疏度下，将LLaMA2-7B的困惑度降低了7.79，平均准确率提高了2.7%。

Conclusion: DLP是一种高效且兼容性强的剪枝方法，适用于多种LLM压缩技术，并可与PEFT无缝集成。

Abstract: Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and
improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream
pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which
can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing
the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have
shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal
performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called
Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the
relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input
activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental
results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity
levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the
perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various
existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at
https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DenseLoRA是一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过使用密集低秩矩阵提高参数效率，性能优于传统LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法中的权重矩阵存在冗余，导致参数利用率低，DenseLoRA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DenseLoRA引入一个编码器-解码器结构，优化隐藏表示后再进行适应，使用密集低秩矩阵替代传统LoRA的双低秩矩阵。

Result: 在LLaMA3-8B上，DenseLoRA仅用0.01%可训练参数达到83.8%准确率，优于LoRA的80.8%（0.70%参数）。

Conclusion: DenseLoRA显著提升了参数效率和模型性能，为大型语言模型的高效适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been developed as an efficient approach for
adapting large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning two low-rank matrices,
thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, prior research
indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to
inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we
introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances
parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA.
DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating
a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across
all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two
redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense
low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We
evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8%
accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8%
accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to systematically assess the impact of
DenseLoRA's components on overall model performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: MARS-Bench是一个多轮现实场景对话基准，用于评估LLMs在长复杂对话中的表现，发现闭源LLMs优于开源模型，显式推理提升鲁棒性，但LLMs在处理动机转移和跨轮依赖时仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面反映LLMs在长复杂对话中的弱点，如动机转移和跨轮依赖，因此设计了MARS-Bench。

Method: 基于实时文本评论构建MARS-Bench，评估多轮对话的三个方面：超多轮、交互多轮和跨轮任务。

Result: 闭源LLMs表现优于开源模型，显式推理提升鲁棒性，但LLMs在处理动机转移和跨轮依赖时表现不佳。

Conclusion: MARS-Bench填补了现有基准的不足，揭示了LLMs在长复杂对话中的挑战，并提供了注意力机制的解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}), e.g. ChatGPT, have been widely adopted
in real-world dialogue applications. However, LLMs' robustness, especially in
handling long complex dialogue sessions, including frequent motivation
transfer, sophisticated cross-turn dependency, is criticized all along.
Nevertheless, no existing benchmarks can fully reflect these weaknesses. We
present \textbf{MARS-Bench}, a \textbf{M}ulti-turn \textbf{A}thletic
\textbf{R}eal-world \textbf{S}cenario Dialogue \textbf{Bench}mark, designed to
remedy the gap. MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary so
to feature realistic dialogues specifically designed to evaluate three critical
aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn,
and Cross-turn Tasks. Extensive experiments on MARS-Bench also reveal that
closed-source LLMs significantly outperform open-source alternatives, explicit
reasoning significantly boosts LLMs' robustness on handling long complex
dialogue sessions, and LLMs indeed face significant challenges when handling
motivation transfer and sophisticated cross-turn dependency. Moreover, we
provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special
tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation when handling long complex
dialogue sessions based on attention visualization experiment in
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction.

TL;DR: 提出LayerIF框架，通过影响函数量化预训练大语言模型各层的训练质量，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视数据影响，依赖模型启发式，导致层训练质量评估不准确，限制下游性能。

Method: 提出LayerIF框架，利用影响函数计算层梯度对验证损失的敏感性，量化层重要性。

Result: 实验表明，LayerIF能任务敏感地评估层重要性，提升LoRA-MoE专家分配和剪枝性能。

Conclusion: LayerIF为数据驱动的层质量评估提供新方法，显著提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers'
training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting
their downstream performance.It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise
training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and
training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric
heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform
allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these
limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages
Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a
principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and
measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by
computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer
importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance
estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different
test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by
leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in
LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM
pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our
model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPLAENet的新方法，用于在社交媒体用户生成内容中检测立场，通过双交叉注意力和情感感知网络提高立场预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展导致大量用户生成内容，其中隐含的观点可能助长错误信息的传播。立场检测成为分析信息偏见和对抗错误信息的关键方法。

Method: SPLAENet采用双交叉注意力机制和分层注意力网络，结合情感分析和标签融合技术，以捕捉文本间的相互关系并提高立场分类的准确性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SPLAENet在准确率和F1分数上均显著优于现有方法，最高提升达17.36%。

Conclusion: SPLAENet在社交媒体错误信息内容中的立场检测方面表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has generated an overwhelming volume of
user-generated content, conveying implicit opinions and contributing to the
spread of misinformation. The method aims to enhance the detection of stance
where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged
as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared
information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method
for \textbf{S}tance \textbf{P}rediction through a \textbf{L}abel-fused dual
cross-\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{E}motion-aware neural \textbf{Net}work
(SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed
method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention
network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant
parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We
incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance
categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the
texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align
extracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to
accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art
methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\% in accuracy and
17.36\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it
achieves average gains of 7.02\% in accuracy and 10.92\% in F1-score. On the
P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\% in accuracy and
11.18\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media
content.

TL;DR: PROSE方法通过迭代优化和验证用户偏好描述，显著提升了LLM代理对人类偏好的推断精度，效果优于现有方法CIPHER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的偏好描述过于通用，无法捕捉人类偏好的独特性和个性化特征。

Method: PROSE结合了迭代优化偏好描述和跨多个用户写作样本验证偏好两项关键技术。

Result: PROSE在多个LLM模型上表现优异，比CIPHER方法提升了33%的生成质量，与ICL结合可额外提升9%。

Conclusion: PROSE为LLM代理的个性化交互提供了更精确的偏好推断方法，且与ICL互补。

Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents
that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the
potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user
preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred
preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic
preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized
nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to
enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing
samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of
inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across
multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e.,
Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an
email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human
preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over
CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly,
we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them
provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的“可操控性”问题，即是否能可靠地生成与多样化用户目标一致的输出。研究发现当前LLMs存在覆盖率不足、校准错误和副作用等问题，且现有干预措施效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在推理和指令遵循方面表现优异，但其是否能满足广泛用户目标（即“可操控性”）尚不明确。

Method: 作者提出一个基于多维目标空间的框架，将用户目标和LLM输出建模为向量，并通过文本重写任务评估LLMs的可操控性。

Result: 研究发现当前LLMs在可操控性方面表现不佳，尤其是副作用问题突出。现有干预措施（如提示工程、采样优化和强化学习微调）效果有限。

Conclusion: 即使强大的LLMs也难以实现良好的可操控性，现有对齐策略可能不足。作者开源了评估框架。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning and
instruction-following benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they can reliably
produce outputs aligned with a broad variety of user goals, a concept we refer
to as steerability. The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior
makes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further
intervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare
user goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot
requests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text
inadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we
introduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user
goals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text
attributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we
find that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are
persistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering,
best-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying
effectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that
even strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies
may be insufficient. We open-source our steerability evaluation framework at
https://github.com/MLD3/steerability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评分方法局限于特定考试格式，缺乏评分透明性，且难以适应多科目和复杂评估类型。RATAS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RATAS利用生成AI模型，基于评分标准对文本答案进行评分，支持多样化评分标准，并提供结构化解释。

Result: 实验表明，RATAS在自动评分中表现出高可靠性和准确性，同时提供透明反馈。

Conclusion: RATAS为自动评分提供了高效、透明且适应性强的解决方案，适用于多样化评估场景。

Abstract: Automated answer grading is a critical challenge in educational technology,
with the potential to streamline assessment processes, ensure grading
consistency, and provide timely feedback to students. However, existing
approaches are often constrained to specific exam formats, lack
interpretability in score assignment, and struggle with real-world
applicability across diverse subjects and assessment types. To address these
limitations, we introduce RATAS (Rubric Automated Tree-based Answer Scoring), a
novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI models for
rubric-based grading of textual responses. RATAS is designed to support a wide
range of grading rubrics, enable subject-agnostic evaluation, and generate
structured, explainable rationales for assigned scores. We formalize the
automatic grading task through a mathematical framework tailored to
rubric-based assessment and present an architecture capable of handling
complex, real-world exam structures. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we
construct a unique, contextualized dataset derived from real-world
project-based courses, encompassing diverse response formats and varying levels
of complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that RATAS achieves high
reliability and accuracy in automated grading while providing interpretable
feedback that enhances transparency for both students and nstructors.

Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地用于替代人类进行对齐任务，研究其是否能复现人类判断和偏好，尤其是在人类存在分歧的模糊场景中。

Method: 通过构建一个“无共识”基准数据集，涵盖多种模糊场景，分析LLMs在三种角色（回答生成、评判、辩论）中的表现。

Result: LLMs在开放回答中能提供细致评估，但在评判或辩论无共识话题时倾向于采取立场。

Conclusion: 需开发更复杂的方法对齐LLMs，因其无法完全捕捉人类在分歧话题上的多样性。

Abstract: The increasing use of LLMs as substitutes for humans in ``aligning'' LLMs has
raised questions about their ability to replicate human judgments and
preferences, especially in ambivalent scenarios where humans disagree. This
study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer
generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously
described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable
oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting
with user interactions. We develop a ``no-consensus'' benchmark by curating
examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each
presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide
nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a
stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These
findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning
LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human
disagreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided.

Motivation: 青少年抑郁症常伴随自杀意念和睡眠障碍，传统方法将语音视为单一模态，限制了其潜力。论文旨在通过多模态和多任务学习提升抑郁症检测的准确性。

Method: 采用基于大型语言模型的架构，整合语音文本、声学特征和生物标志物，结合多任务学习和纵向分析策略。

Result: 在抑郁症早期预警数据集上，平衡准确率达到70.8%，优于单模态、单任务和非纵向方法。

Conclusion: 多模态、多任务和纵向分析的结合显著提升了抑郁症检测的准确性，为心理健康监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights
into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In
contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal
multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the
potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based
depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived
text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents
a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as
suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional
opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by
simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances
using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis
strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions,
allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our
proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the
Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%,
which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal
methods.

Abstract: Retrieving the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
essential for target identification (Target ID) in drug development. Given the
vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and
challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently
exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer
benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological
impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a
benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard
dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an
ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics,
which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA
pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the
research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.

introduce several baseline approaches and an extendable automatic evaluation
framework using top LLMs as judges to tackle the difficulty of recruiting
domain experts for manual evaluation. Utilizing papers withdrawn from arXiv, we
validated our proposed methods with several leading reasoning LLMs from
different providers and assessed their performance and API costs for
identifying critical errors and unsoundness problems. The OpenAI o3 model
performed the best, while o4-mini was the most cost-effective one in our
evaluation. This paper provides insights into document-based scientific

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）展现越来越接近人类的能力，如何使其与个体化的人类价值观对齐变得至关重要。现有方法多关注广泛伦理问题，而忽略了模拟个体价值观。

Method: ValueSim通过将结构化个人数据转化为叙事背景故事，并采用基于认知-情感人格系统的多模块架构，模拟个体价值观。

Result: 在基于世界价值观调查的自建基准测试中，ValueSim的top-1准确率比检索增强生成方法提高了10%以上，且随着用户交互历史的增加，性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: ValueSim能够有效模拟个体价值观，并在交互历史增加时优化其模拟能力，为LLMs的个体化对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit increasingly human-like
capabilities, aligning them with human values has become critically important.
Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement
learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However,
while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness,
they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address
this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values
through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and
demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into
narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the
Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on
these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from
the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over
10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis
reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history
becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法成本高、效果有限且难以扩展到更大模型和开放生成任务，因此需要一种更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: BiasFilter在推理时实时评估中间输出，维护候选续集，并通过基于公平奖励信号的筛选逐步完成生成。

Result: 实验表明，BiasFilter能有效减轻多种大型语言模型的社会偏见，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: BiasFilter为去偏提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于开源和API基础的模型。

Abstract: Mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasingly important research objective. However, existing debiasing methods
often incur high human and computational costs, exhibit limited effectiveness,
and struggle to scale to larger models and open-ended generation tasks. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic,
inference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both
open-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced
data or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering
generation outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates
intermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate
continuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward
segments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we
construct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to
assess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of
LLMs while preserving overall generation quality.

TL;DR: EvoMoE提出了一种创新的MoE调优框架，通过专家进化和动态路由机制解决了多模态MoE中的专家同质化和路由器僵化问题，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态MoE方法面临专家同质化和路由器僵化两大挑战，限制了模型性能的提升。

Method: EvoMoE采用专家进化策略和动态令牌感知路由器（DTR），通过超网络动态生成路由权重。

Result: 实验表明，EvoMoE在多个多模态基准测试中显著优于其他稀疏MLLM。

Conclusion: EvoMoE有效解决了专家同质化和路由器僵化问题，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach
significantly enhances the capacity of large language models (LLMs) and
improves performance on downstream tasks. Building on these promising results,
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE
techniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two
key challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs
because MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN
parameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the
intended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity
stems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection,
which fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in
similar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations,
we propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a
meticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves
multiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert
evolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore,
we introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism
that allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and
intrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks,
which dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other
sparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME,
MMBench, TextVQA, and POPE. Our results highlight the effectiveness of EvoMoE
in enhancing the performance of MLLMs by addressing the critical issues of
expert uniformity and router rigidity.

Motivation: 中国非物质文化遗产面临现代化带来的威胁，如损坏、消失和传承中断。尽管中国在联合国教科文组织ICH名录中项目最多，但保护需求迫切。大语言模型的快速发展为ICH保护提供了新思路。

Method: 利用开源中文ICH数据开发ICH-Qwen模型，结合大语言模型的自然语言理解和知识推理能力，并通过合成数据与微调技术优化模型。

Result: 实验证明ICH-Qwen在ICH领域任务中表现有效，为ICH的保护、传承和传播提供了智能解决方案。

Conclusion: ICH-Qwen为ICH的可持续发展提供了理论与实践参考，并为数字人文研究开辟了新路径。

Abstract: The intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of China, a cultural asset transmitted
across generations by various ethnic groups, serves as a significant testament
to the evolution of human civilization and holds irreplaceable value for the
preservation of historical lineage and the enhancement of cultural
self-confidence. However, the rapid pace of modernization poses formidable
challenges to ICH, including threats damage, disappearance and discontinuity of
inheritance. China has the highest number of items on the UNESCO Intangible
Cultural Heritage List, which is indicative of the nation's abundant cultural
resources and emphasises the pressing need for ICH preservation. In recent
years, the rapid advancements in large language modelling have provided a novel
technological approach for the preservation and dissemination of ICH. This
study utilises a substantial corpus of open-source Chinese ICH data to develop
a large language model, ICH-Qwen, for the ICH domain. The model employs natural
language understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities of large language
models, augmented with synthetic data and fine-tuning techniques. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICH-Qwen in executing tasks
specific to the ICH domain. It is anticipated that the model will provide
intelligent solutions for the protection, inheritance and dissemination of
intangible cultural heritage, as well as new theoretical and practical
references for the sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage.
Furthermore, it is expected that the study will open up new paths for digital
humanities research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律案例检索研究存在数据规模小、检索方法局限的问题，无法反映真实法律检索场景的复杂性。

Method: 提出了LEGAR BENCH基准（覆盖411种犯罪类型和120万案例）和LegalSearchLM模型（通过法律元素推理和约束解码生成相关内容）。

Result: LegalSearchLM在LEGAR BENCH上比基线模型性能提升6-20%，并在域外案例上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LEGAR BENCH和LegalSearchLM为法律案例检索提供了更全面和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), which retrieves relevant cases from a query case,
is a fundamental task for legal professionals in research and decision-making.
However, existing studies on LCR face two major limitations. First, they are
evaluated on relatively small-scale retrieval corpora (e.g., 100-55K cases) and
use a narrow range of criminal query types, which cannot sufficiently reflect
the complexity of real-world legal retrieval scenarios. Second, their reliance
on embedding-based or lexical matching methods often results in limited
representations and legally irrelevant matches. To address these issues, we
present: (1) LEGAR BENCH, the first large-scale Korean LCR benchmark, covering
411 diverse crime types in queries over 1.2M legal cases; and (2)
LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model that performs legal element reasoning over the
query case and directly generates content grounded in the target cases through
constrained decoding. Experimental results show that LegalSearchLM outperforms
baselines by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It
also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming
naive generative models trained on in-domain data by 15%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简单有效的基准测试方法，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的抽象推理能力，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在建立一个理论基础扎实的基准，以严格测试LLMs的抽象推理能力，识别其真实模式识别与记忆依赖的区别。

Method: 开发了数学框架定义抽象推理，并引入两个新指标（γ和Δ分数），设计了符号重映射的基准测试。

Result: 发现LLMs在非十进制算术和符号推理中存在显著不足，Δ分数能有效量化记忆依赖。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在抽象推理方面仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to establish a simple, effective, and theoretically
grounded benchmark for rigorously probing abstract reasoning in Large Language
Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that
defines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns
independent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to
these abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel
complementary metrics: \(\scoreGamma\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while
\(\scoreDelta\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than
underlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere
memorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic
symbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate
genuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM
evaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent)
reveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic
reasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting;
and 3) \(\scoreDelta\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence
by quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly
highlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that
current LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract
reasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有访问控制平台无法处理语义丰富或模糊的场景，且策略编写过程存在语义鸿沟。

Method: LACE结合提示引导的策略生成、检索增强推理和形式化验证，将自然语言策略转化为结构化规则。

Result: LACE在智能家居环境中验证了100%的策略生成正确性，决策准确率达88%，优于GPT-3.5和Gemini。

Conclusion: LACE为IoT平台提供了安全、灵活且用户友好的访问控制解决方案。

Abstract: Access control in the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly
complex, as policies must account for dynamic and contextual factors such as
time, location, user behavior, and environmental conditions. However, existing
platforms either offer only coarse-grained controls or rely on rigid rule
matching, making them ill-suited for semantically rich or ambiguous access
scenarios. Moreover, the policy authoring process remains fragmented: domain
experts describe requirements in natural language, but developers must manually
translate them into code, introducing semantic gaps and potential
misconfiguration. In this work, we present LACE, the Language-based Access
Control Engine, a hybrid framework that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to bridge the gap between human intent and machine-enforceable logic. LACE
combines prompt-guided policy generation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and
formal validation to support expressive, interpretable, and verifiable access
control. It enables users to specify policies in natural language,
automatically translates them into structured rules, validates semantic
correctness, and makes access decisions using a hybrid LLM-rule-based engine.
We evaluate LACE in smart home environments through extensive experiments. LACE
achieves 100% correctness in verified policy generation and up to 88% decision
accuracy with 0.79 F1-score using DeepSeek-V3, outperforming baselines such as
GPT-3.5 and Gemini. The system also demonstrates strong scalability under
increasing policy volume and request concurrency. Our results highlight LACE's
potential to enable secure, flexible, and user-friendly access control across
real-world IoT platforms.

Motivation: 研究AI模型是否能识别评估场景，以避免评估结果被模型行为差异影响，从而确保评估的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含1000个提示和文本的多样化基准，测试模型在区分评估和实际部署文本的能力，并比较模型与人类的表现。

Result: 前沿模型（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）表现出高于随机的评估意识（AUC 0.83），但不及人类基线（AUC 0.92）。模型和人类在代理场景中表现更好。

Conclusion: 前沿模型已具备显著的评估意识，但未达超人类水平，建议未来跟踪此能力。

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of
evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically
different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for
deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language
models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from
evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation
awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts
and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g.,
MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories
from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models
clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches
an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of
$0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying
evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we
test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under
multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random
chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate
that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman,
level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future
models.

Motivation: LLM在POI预测任务中面临时空数据理解和候选空间过大的挑战，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: 提出CoMaPOI框架，包含三个代理：Profiler（数据转换）、Forecaster（空间约束）、Predictor（预测生成）。

Result: 在三个数据集上性能提升5%-10%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoMaPOI通过协作代理解决了LLM在复杂时空任务中的挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next
Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in
semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based
methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely
overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task.
Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic
understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling
of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively
large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or
irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative
Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close
interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor),
CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler
agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions,
enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically
constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent
integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that
CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to
10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of
challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by
leveraging tailored collaborative agents.

TL;DR: SYCON Bench是一个用于评估多轮对话中大语言模型（LLMs）谄媚行为的新基准，发现谄媚行为普遍存在，但通过调整提示策略（如第三人称视角）可显著减少谄媚行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮对话中LLMs的谄媚行为，忽略了多轮交互的动态性，因此需要开发更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入SYCON Bench基准，测量模型在多轮对话中快速附和用户（Turn of Flip）和频繁改变立场（Number of Flip）的行为。测试了17种LLMs，并分析了模型规模、推理优化和提示策略的影响。

Result: 谄媚行为普遍存在，对齐调优会加剧谄媚，而模型规模和推理优化能增强抵抗用户不当观点的能力。第三人称视角提示策略在辩论场景中减少谄媚行为达63.8%。

Conclusion: SYCON Bench为评估LLMs谄媚行为提供了有效工具，并揭示了优化模型设计和提示策略以减少谄媚的潜在方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless
responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs
regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on
sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness,
overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce
SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in
multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how
quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it
shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying
SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that
sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment
tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning
optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views.
Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail
when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the
user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting
strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces
sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at

Motivation: 少样本提示在有限标注数据下高效推理，但其性能依赖示例选择质量。HED-LM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用混合选择流程：先用欧氏距离筛选候选示例，再用大型语言模型根据上下文相关性重新排序。

Result: 在疲劳检测任务中，HED-LM的F1分数为69.13±10.71%，优于随机选择（59.30±10.13%）和仅距离过滤（67.61±11.39%）。

Conclusion: HED-LM通过结合数值相似性和上下文相关性，提升了少样本提示的鲁棒性，适用于医疗监测、活动识别和工业安全等领域。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

Conclusion: Cluster Shapley是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种摘要生成场景，能够平衡计算成本和贡献评估的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve
and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI
assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent
summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising
concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of
valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using
Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each
document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley
values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley,
an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between
documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing
Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces
computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach
to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley
significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP
with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM
used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes
it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

Abstract: Multi-round incomplete information tasks are crucial for evaluating the
lateral thinking capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Currently,
research primarily relies on multiple benchmarks and automated evaluation
metrics to assess these abilities. However, our study reveals novel insights
into the limitations of existing methods, as they often yield misleading
results that fail to uncover key issues, such as shortcut-taking behaviors,
rigid patterns, and premature task termination. These issues obscure the true
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and undermine the reliability of evaluations. To
address these limitations, we propose a refined set of evaluation standards,
including inspection of reasoning paths, diversified assessment metrics, and
comparative analyses with human performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise but remain
challenging to continually improve through traditional finetuning, particularly
when integrating capabilities from other specialized LLMs. Popular methods like
ensemble and weight merging require substantial memory and struggle to adapt to
changing data environments. Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from
multiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from
interference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited
flexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these
issues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge
from diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory
overhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an
adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based
on their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a
dynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of
candidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the
selector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge
aggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared
to existing approaches. Code is avaliable at

*Jakub Podolak,Rajeev Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了DeepSeek R1-32B在问答任务中自我报告的置信度，发现默认设置下模型常过度自信，而语义熵更可靠。通过增加计算预算和长链思考可显著改善置信度效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型在不确定性估计中的可靠性，特别是自我报告置信度的有效性。

Method: 分析模型在不同设置下的置信度表现，包括默认答案-置信度模式和语义熵方法，并通过长链思考实验验证假设。

Result: 语义熵和长链思考能显著提升置信度可靠性，且独立阅读模型可重建类似置信度。

Conclusion: 可靠的不确定性估计需显式探索生成空间，自我报告置信度需在充分探索后才可信。

Abstract: We study the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B by analyzing its
self-reported verbal confidence on question answering (QA) tasks. In the
default answer-then-confidence setting, the model is regularly over-confident,
whereas semantic entropy - obtained by sampling many responses - remains
reliable. We hypothesize that this is because of semantic entropy's larger
test-time compute, which lets us explore the model's predictive distribution.
We show that granting DeepSeek the budget to explore its distribution by
forcing a long chain-of-thought before the final answer greatly improves its
verbal score effectiveness, even on simple fact-retrieval questions that
normally require no reasoning. Furthermore, a separate reader model that sees
only the chain can reconstruct very similar confidences, indicating the verbal
score might be merely a statistic of the alternatives surfaced during
reasoning. Our analysis concludes that reliable uncertainty estimation requires
explicit exploration of the generative space, and self-reported confidence is
trustworthy only after such exploration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于并行离散事件模拟（PDES）的方法，将多个AI和非AI代理以因果规则方式结合，确保输出正确性，并通过实验验证其优于纯AI模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分发挥AI系统的潜力并确保其可信性，需要将多个AI和非AI系统无缝结合，以约束和验证输出。

Method: 采用PDES框架，将每个代理视为实体，通过时间传递机制协同工作，非AI代理作为审计者动态约束AI代理的输出。

Result: 在四个不同领域的问题上，该方法准确率达68%，显著高于纯AI模型的23%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合AI和非AI代理，显著提升了问题解决的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: To fully leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in a
trustworthy manner, it is desirable to couple multiple AI and non-AI systems
together seamlessly for constraining and ensuring correctness of the output.
This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based
methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based
way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each
agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior
requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work
in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in
parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to
the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using
non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of
such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can
enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory
bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and
non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when
necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then
progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI
agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that
certain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving
four problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those
from AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems
from various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely
by themselves. Results show that overall accuracy of our approach is 68% where
as the accuracy of vanilla models is less than 23%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过抑制特定标记序列（如<think>后的双换行符和结束标记），减少大型语言模型对敏感内容的拒绝率，无需修改模型权重或提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到某些模型在拒绝敏感内容前会生成特定标记序列（如<think>后接双换行符），希望通过简单调整生成过程中的标记概率来减少拒绝行为。

Method: 在生成过程中抑制<think>后的双换行符（\n\n）和结束标记（</think>后的结束序列标记），不修改模型权重或提示。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型上的实验表明，该方法提高了对敏感提示的实质性回答比例，且不影响标准基准性能。

Conclusion: 通过阻断生成过程中的拒绝子空间，可以有效规避模型的拒绝行为。

Abstract: We introduce a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs)
on sensitive content without modifying model weights or prompts. Motivated by
the observation that refusals in certain models were often preceded by the
specific token sequence of a token marking the beginning of the
chain-of-thought (CoT) block (<think>) followed by a double newline token
(\n\n), we investigate the impact of two simple formatting adjustments during
generation: suppressing \n\n after <think> and suppressing the end-of-sequence
token after the end of the CoT block (</think>). Our method requires no
datasets, parameter changes, or training, relying solely on modifying token
probabilities during generation. In our experiments with official DeepSeek-R1
distillations, these interventions increased the proportion of substantive
answers to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard
benchmarks. Our findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by
blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

### [45] [ASyMOB: Algebraic Symbolic Mathematical Operations Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23851)
*Michael Shalyt,Rotem Elimelech,Ido Kaminer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASyMOB是一个专注于符号数学评估的新框架，揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在符号数学问题中的表现依赖记忆而非深层理解，同时展示了先进模型的显著鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估LLMs在符号数学（如积分、微分方程和代数简化）中的核心能力，因此需要开发新的评估框架。

Method: 引入ASyMOB框架，包含17,092个数学问题，通过数值或符号扰动分析LLMs的泛化能力，并与计算机代数系统（CAS）对比。

Result: LLMs在扰动问题中表现显著下降（最高-70.3%），但先进模型（如o4-mini和Gemini 2.5 Flash）表现出高准确性和鲁棒性（仅下降21.7%和21.2%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号数学中的能力仍有局限性，未来可能需结合外部工具或开发更强大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency
in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced
science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing
the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration,
differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we
introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic
manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity
and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by
comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic
`perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance
for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized
patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models
achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra
systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as
problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated
code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without
code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain
perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5
Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and
97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against
perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models).
This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization
capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward
lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing
models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.

TL;DR: LLMs作为自主代理尝试复现阿尔茨海默病研究结果，平均复现率为53.2%，展示了潜力但也暴露了局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs作为自主代理在生物医学研究中自动化复现研究结果的能力。

Method: 使用GPT-4o模拟研究团队，基于NACC数据集和论文摘要、方法部分及数据字典，动态复现五项研究的关键发现。

Result: LLM代理平均复现了53.2%的发现，数值和统计方法存在差异，但部分趋势和显著性相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化复现研究中显示出潜力，但仍受限于实现细节和方法描述的完整性。

Abstract: Objective: To demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents to reproduce findings of published research studies using the
same or similar dataset.
  Materials and Methods: We used the "Quick Access" dataset of the National
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). We identified highly cited published
research manuscripts using NACC data and selected five studies that appeared
reproducible using this dataset alone. Using GPT-4o, we created a simulated
research team of LLM-based autonomous agents tasked with writing and executing
code to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study, given only study
Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.
  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5
Alzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of
findings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed
between studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or
parameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and
significance were sometimes similar.
  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques
and findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing
methodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in
fully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation
highlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable
evaluation of scientific rigor.
  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and
limitations of LLMs as autonomous agents for automating reproducibility in
biomedical research.

*Linwei Tao,Yi-Fan Yeh,Minjing Dong,Tao Huang,Philip Torr,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文全面研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）的不确定性估计，评估了80种模型，发现语言不确定性（LVU）表现最佳，并揭示了模型规模、后训练等因素对估计性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在高风险应用中的部署增加，不确定性估计对确保其安全可信至关重要。

Method: 评估了80种模型，聚焦于三种黑盒单次方法（TPU、NVU、LVU），使用MMLU-Pro基准进行系统评估。

Result: LVU表现最优，校准和区分能力更强；高精度不意味着可靠的不确定性；模型规模等因素影响估计性能。

Conclusion: 需多角度评估不确定性，LVU是提升LLMs可靠性的实用工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
applications, robust uncertainty estimation is essential for ensuring the safe
and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. We present the most comprehensive study to
date of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, evaluating 80 models spanning open- and
closed-source families, dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures,
reasoning and non-reasoning modes, quantization variants and parameter scales
from 0.6B to 671B. Focusing on three representative black-box single-pass
methods, including token probability-based uncertainty (TPU), numerical verbal
uncertainty (NVU), and linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU), we systematically
evaluate uncertainty calibration and selective classification using the
challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark, which covers both reasoning-intensive and
knowledge-based tasks. Our results show that LVU consistently outperforms TPU
and NVU, offering stronger calibration and discrimination while being more
interpretable. We also find that high accuracy does not imply reliable
uncertainty, and that model scale, post-training, reasoning ability and
quantization all influence estimation performance. Notably, LLMs exhibit better
uncertainty estimates on reasoning tasks than on knowledge-heavy ones, and good
calibration does not necessarily translate to effective error ranking. These
findings highlight the need for multi-perspective evaluation and position LVU
as a practical tool for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world
settings.

TL;DR: OMNIGUARD是一种检测跨语言和多模态有害提示的方法，通过利用LLM/MLLM的内部表示构建分类器，显著提升了检测准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的潜在有害使用引发担忧，现有检测方法在多语言和多模态场景下存在漏洞。

Method: OMNIGUARD通过识别LLM/MLLM跨语言或多模态对齐的内部表示，构建语言或模态无关的分类器。

Result: OMNIGUARD在多语言、图像和音频提示检测中分别提升了11.57%、20.44%的准确率，且效率提升了约120倍。

Conclusion: OMNIGUARD为有害提示检测提供了高效且跨语言/多模态的解决方案，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked
concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach
to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model.
Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to
attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g.,
prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities
such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose OMNIGUARD, an
approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our
approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are
aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a
language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful
prompts. OMNIGUARD improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\%
over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for
image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By
repurposing embeddings computed during generation, OMNIGUARD is also very
efficient ($\approx 120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code
and data are available at: https://github.com/vsahil/OmniGuard.

TL;DR: Infi-Med 是一个针对医疗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的框架，通过高效资源利用、增强多模态推理能力和系统评估，解决了医疗任务中的资源效率、诊断准确性和伦理隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗 MLLMs 在实际部署中面临资源效率、诊断准确性、临床考量和伦理隐私等挑战，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 提出 Infi-Med 框架，包括高效 SFT 数据集构建、增强多模态推理能力，以及系统评估体系。

Result: 实验表明 Infi-Med 在通用医疗推理中达到 SOTA 性能，并能快速适应临床场景。

Conclusion: Infi-Med 为医疗 MLLMs 的实际部署提供了有效平衡模型性能和操作限制的基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising
prospects in healthcare, particularly for addressing complex medical tasks,
supporting multidisciplinary treatment (MDT), and enabling personalized
precision medicine. However, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical
considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose
Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key
innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and
constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal
sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both
pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning
capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and
(3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across
medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while
maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes
a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by
balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）通过上下文学习（ICL）适应新任务的能力，提出任务向量（task vectors）可能编码任务信息。作者引入了一个包含3,096个多样化少样本任务的数据集QuiteAFew，并通过实验发现任务向量性能在中间层达到峰值，且任务类型和复杂性影响其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究受限于小规模基准测试，无法全面分析任务向量的作用。作者希望通过大规模数据集QuiteAFew，更深入地探索任务向量在ICL中的表现和机制。

Method: 使用Llama-3-8B模型在QuiteAFew数据集上进行实验，分析任务向量在不同层、任务类型和复杂性下的表现。

Result: 任务向量性能在中间层（如第15层）达到峰值；任务类型显著影响其效果；复杂任务依赖多个子任务向量而非单一向量，表明任务知识是分布式表征的。

Conclusion: 任务向量在ICL中表现复杂，其效果受层数、任务类型和复杂性影响，且复杂任务需要分布式表征。这一发现为理解LLMs的适应机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks using few examples, with task vectors - specific hidden state
activations - hypothesized to encode task information. Existing studies are
limited by small-scale benchmarks, restricting comprehensive analysis. We
introduce QuiteAFew, a novel dataset of 3,096 diverse few-shot tasks, each with
30 input-output pairs derived from the Alpaca dataset. Experiments with
Llama-3-8B on QuiteAFew reveal: (1) task vector performance peaks at an
intermediate layer (e.g., 15th), (2) effectiveness varies significantly by task
type, and (3) complex tasks rely on multiple, subtask-specific vectors rather
than a single vector, suggesting distributed task knowledge representation.

Result: 在三个长文本QA数据集上，模型表现出更好的校准性和跨领域泛化能力，且方法高效。

Conclusion: LoVeC是一种高效且可推广的长文本生成置信度估计方法，能有效检测幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge for the safe and trustworthy
deployment of large language models (LLMs) in factual content generation. Prior
work has explored confidence estimation as an effective approach to
hallucination detection, but often relies on post-hoc self-consistency methods
that require computationally expensive sampling. Verbalized confidence offers a
more efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to
short-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to
open-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized
Confidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for
long-form generation. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train
LLMs to append numerical confidence scores to each generated statement, serving
as a direct and interpretable signal of the factuality of generation. Our
experiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO,
ORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel
evaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess
different verbalized confidence estimation methods. Experiments on three
long-form QA datasets show that our RL-trained models achieve better
calibration and generalize robustly across domains. Also, our method is highly
efficient, as it only requires adding a few tokens to the output being decoded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在内容审核中过度敏感的问题，探索其误判背后的深层原因。

Method: 引入主题关联分析（Topic Association Analysis），通过生成自由形式场景想象并分析主题放大水平，量化LLM的主题偏见。

Result: 发现更先进的模型（如GPT-4 Turbo）尽管总体误判率较低，但表现出更强的主题刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要超越基于关键词的过滤方法，改进LLM的审核机制，以减少主题偏见导致的误判。

Abstract: Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often
misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While
previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive
terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic
topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's
implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a
semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with
toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for
misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels,
we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger
topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases
suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely
on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings
highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing
insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型在可扩展性和适应主观对话偏好方面存在不足，ChARM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ChARM采用自适应边界和自进化机制，利用大规模未标记数据提升训练覆盖范围，并引入了RoleplayPref数据集和RoleplayEval评估基准。

Result: 实验结果显示，ChARM在偏好排名上比传统Bradley-Terry模型提升了13%，并在CharacterEval和RoleplayEval上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: ChARM通过创新方法显著提升了角色扮演语言代理的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) aim to simulate characters for realistic
and engaging human-computer interactions. However, traditional reward models
often struggle with scalability and adapting to subjective conversational
preferences. We propose ChARM, a Character-based Act-adaptive Reward Model,
addressing these challenges through two innovations: (1) an act-adaptive margin
that significantly enhances learning efficiency and generalizability, and (2) a
self-evolution mechanism leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve
training coverage. Additionally, we introduce RoleplayPref, the first
large-scale preference dataset specifically for RPLAs, featuring 1,108
characters, 13 subcategories, and 16,888 bilingual dialogues, alongside
RoleplayEval, a dedicated evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show a 13%
improvement over the conventional Bradley-Terry model in preference rankings.
Furthermore, applying ChARM-generated rewards to preference learning techniques
(e.g., direct preference optimization) achieves state-of-the-art results on
CharacterEval and RoleplayEval. Code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: "大声思考"方法因转录和标注工作量大而难以大规模应用，限制了其在认知科学中的使用。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具自动转录和标注640名参与者在数学推理任务中的口头报告，并将其编码为搜索图。

Result: 研究发现自动方法与人工标注具有中等一致性，并揭示了人类推理的一致性和变异性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了大规模"大声思考"数据的价值，并为自动化分析口头报告提供了概念验证。

Abstract: The think-aloud method, where participants voice their thoughts as they solve
a task, is a valuable source of rich data about human reasoning processes. Yet,
it has declined in popularity in contemporary cognitive science, largely
because labor-intensive transcription and annotation preclude large sample
sizes. Here, we develop methods to automate the transcription and annotation of
verbal reports of reasoning using natural language processing tools, allowing
for large-scale analysis of think-aloud data. In our study, 640 participants
thought aloud while playing the Game of 24, a mathematical reasoning task. We
automatically transcribed the recordings and coded the transcripts as search
graphs, finding moderate inter-rater reliability with humans. We analyze these
graphs and characterize consistency and variation in human reasoning traces.
Our work demonstrates the value of think-aloud data at scale and serves as a
proof of concept for the automated analysis of verbal reports.

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法真实反映软件开发中的协作和迭代过程，因此需要一种更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: SwingArena通过配对LLMs作为提交者（生成补丁）和评审者（创建测试用例并通过CI验证补丁），结合检索增强的代码生成（RACG）模块处理长上下文问题。

Result: 实验表明，不同模型在补丁生成和CI验证中表现各异（如GPT-4o擅长激进补丁生成，DeepSeek和Gemini更注重正确性）。

Conclusion: SwingArena提供了一种可扩展且贴近现实的LLM评估方法，适用于CI驱动的软件开发环境。

Abstract: We present SwingArena, a competitive evaluation framework for Large Language
Models (LLMs) that closely mirrors real-world software development workflows.
Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative
process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate
patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through
continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive
evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module
that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and
semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple
programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework
to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations.
Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected
from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive
patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI
validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for
evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings. More

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的动态提示方案，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在因果关系检测和挖掘任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督方法性能差且泛化能力弱，监督方法缺乏大规模训练数据。LLMs通过提示工程可缓解数据不足问题，但缺乏相关研究。

Method: 采用RAG动态提示方案，通过检索增强生成优化LLMs的提示策略。

Result: 在三个数据集和五种LLMs上的实验表明，RAG动态提示优于静态提示方案。

Conclusion: RAG动态提示显著提升了LLMs在因果关系任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Causality detection and mining are important tasks in information retrieval
due to their enormous use in information extraction, and knowledge graph
construction. To solve these tasks, in existing literature there exist several
solutions -- both unsupervised and supervised. However, the unsupervised
methods suffer from poor performance and they often require significant human
intervention for causal rule selection, leading to poor generalization across
different domains. On the other hand, supervised methods suffer from the lack
of large training datasets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with
effective prompt engineering are found to be effective to overcome the issue of
unavailability of large training dataset. Yet, in existing literature, there
does not exist comprehensive works on causality detection and mining using LLM
prompting. In this paper, we present several retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) based dynamic prompting schemes to enhance LLM performance in causality
detection and extraction tasks. Extensive experiments over three datasets and
five LLMs validate the superiority of our proposed RAG-based dynamic prompting
over other static prompting schemes.

*Sriram Balasubramanian,Samyadeep Basu,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面评估了大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中思维链（CoT）推理的忠实性，揭示了文本和图像偏见对推理的影响，并提出了新的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨CoT推理是否真实反映模型内部过程，特别是视觉语言模型中未被充分研究的图像偏见对推理的影响。

Method: 引入细粒度评估框架，分析偏见表达模式，比较文本和图像偏见的处理差异。

Result: 发现图像偏见较少被模型表达，且模型存在"不一致"推理现象。语言模型在隐含线索表达上仍有困难。

Conclusion: 研究为CoT忠实性提供了新见解，揭示了模型推理中的潜在偏见和不一致性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language
models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully
reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive
study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs),
investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases
affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel,
fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns,
enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous
methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and
respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT
faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely
articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized
for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified
phenomenon we term ``inconsistent'' reasoning - correctly reasoning before
abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased
reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to
revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our
findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to
struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLAT-LLM是一种基于细粒度低秩变换的无训练结构压缩方法，通过PCA和自适应秩分配实现高效压缩，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管低秩分解方法在LLM压缩中表现良好，但其存在精度下降、校准成本高和架构效率低的问题，FLAT-LLM旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用PCA计算截断特征向量变换权重，并通过重要性指标自适应分配秩，实现无训练压缩。

Result: 在4个模型和11个数据集上，FLAT-LLM在泛化和下游任务中优于结构剪枝基线，并加速推理。

Conclusion: FLAT-LLM提供了一种快速、准确且无需微调的结构压缩方法，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural
language processing, yet their high computational and memory demands pose
challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Although recent
low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural
compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration
procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder
real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and
accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained
low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the
hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors
computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employ an
importance-based metric to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM
achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery
fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes.
Evaluated across 4 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural
pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while
delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的不确定性感知公平性度量UCerF，以更细致地评估LLM的公平性，并引入了一个新的性别-职业公平性评估数据集。通过基准测试，发现传统公平性度量可能忽略模型信心偏差，而UCerF能捕捉到这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性度量仅关注离散的准确性评估，未能捕捉模型不确定性对公平性的隐性影响。

Method: 提出UCerF度量，并构建包含31,756个样本的性别-职业公平性评估数据集，用于评估10个开源LLM。

Result: Mistral-7B等模型因对错误预测的高信心表现出次优公平性，传统度量（如Equalized Odds）未能发现，而UCerF捕捉到了这一点。

Conclusion: UCerF和新的数据集为评估LLM公平性提供了更全面的工具，有助于开发更透明和负责任的AI系统。

Abstract: The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the
critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics,
which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction
correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g.,
higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy).
To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric,
UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more
reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional
fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity
issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness
evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a
more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a
benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior
of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness
due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by
Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark,
which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for
developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer内部机制与参数规模扩展规律的关系，通过偏置-多样性分解分析层的行为，发现性能提升依赖于层的多样性和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer内部机制（如残差流中的层行为）与参数规模扩展规律之间的关系，以理解性能提升的根本原因。

Method: 采用偏置-多样性分解理论分析Transformer的层行为，定义偏置（预测误差）和多样性（层输出差异），并通过信息论多样性验证理论。

Result: 性能提升依赖于层的多样性和预测准确性；增加层数仅在层行为多样时有效，且性能增益呈现次模性（边际收益递减）。

Conclusion: 层多样性是Transformer性能提升的关键因素，与参数规模扩展规律一致，实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and
are now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs).
Their task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as
shown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent
mechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the
internal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the
relationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws
remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which
mainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first
theoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a
bias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error
of each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which
indicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing
Transformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when
individual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain
mutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when
individual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce
an information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding
layers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,
are diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of
layers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional
layers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the
parameter scaling laws. Experiments on multiple semantic-understanding tasks
with various LLMs empirically confirm the theoretical properties derived in
this study.

TL;DR: GenCP通过结合LLM和CP推理，将文本生成建模为CSP问题，并引入MLM实现双向约束传播，提升约束感知的文本生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成流畅文本时难以满足外部约束，GenCP旨在通过结合CP推理解决这一问题。

Method: 改进GenCP，集成MLM进行域生成，实现双向约束传播，利用过去和未来令牌信息。

Result: 在COLLIE基准测试中，MLM的引入显著提升了GenCP性能，生成更可靠且符合约束的文本。

Conclusion: 尽管增加了MLM调用和回溯，但该方法优化了LLM推理效率，特别适用于严格约束任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle to
enforce external constraints because they generate tokens sequentially without
explicit control mechanisms. GenCP addresses this limitation by combining LLM
predictions with Constraint Programming (CP) reasoning, formulating text
generation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we
improve GenCP by integrating Masked Language Models (MLMs) for domain
generation, which allows bidirectional constraint propagation that leverages
both past and future tokens. This integration bridges the gap between
token-level prediction and structured constraint enforcement, leading to more
reliable and constraint-aware text generation. Our evaluation on COLLIE
benchmarks demonstrates that incorporating domain preview via MLM calls
significantly improves GenCP's performance. Although this approach incurs
additional MLM calls and, in some cases, increased backtracking, the overall
effect is a more efficient use of LLM inferences and an enhanced ability to
generate feasible and meaningful solutions, particularly in tasks with strict
content constraints.

Abstract: This paper discusses the construction, fine-tuning, and deployment of
BeaverTalk, a cascaded system for speech-to-text translation as part of the
IWSLT 2025 simultaneous translation task. The system architecture employs a VAD
segmenter for breaking a speech stream into segments, Whisper Large V2 for
automatic speech recognition (ASR), and Gemma 3 12B for simultaneous
translation. Regarding the simultaneous translation LLM, it is fine-tuned via

leverages a single prior-sentence memory bank from the source language as
context. The cascaded system participated in the English$\rightarrow$German and
English$\rightarrow$Chinese language directions for both the low and high

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不重新处理完整输入的情况下，通过合并独立编码的文档表示来支持下游任务，提高效率和灵活性。

Method: 提出“文档汤”策略，独立编码文档并通过简单操作（如平均）合并表示，微调Mamba2模型以生成可合并的表示。

Result: 在HotpotQA上，合并十个独立编码的文档几乎达到了交叉编码器在相同输入上的性能，支持多跳QA、稀疏检索和长文档推理。

Conclusion: 文档汤策略有效支持模块化编码和重用，为下游任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models
(SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by
model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently
and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging --
into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping,
enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each
query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find
that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning
with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents
nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.

Result: LLMs与医生学员的相关性评估不一致，但过滤无关内容后双方准确性均提高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了逻辑一致性的重要性，并提供了公开数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks, including standardized
medical exams. However, correct answers alone do not ensure correct logic, and
models may reach accurate conclusions through flawed processes. In this study,
we introduce the MedPAIR (Medical Dataset Comparing Physicians and AI Relevance
Estimation and Question Answering) dataset to evaluate how physician trainees
and LLMs prioritize relevant information when answering QA questions. We obtain
annotations on 1,300 QA pairs from 36 physician trainees, labeling each
sentence within the question components for relevance. We compare these
relevance estimates to those for LLMs, and further evaluate the impact of these
"relevant" subsets on downstream task performance for both physician trainees
and LLMs. We find that LLMs are frequently not aligned with the content
relevance estimates of physician trainees. After filtering out physician
trainee-labeled irrelevant sentences, accuracy improves for both the trainees
and the LLMs. All LLM and physician trainee-labeled data are available at:

Motivation: 现有评估数据集范围有限且以文本为主，缺乏统一的多模态基准，因此需要构建一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 通过自动和手动过滤构建包含52,000+问题的数据集，涵盖多种题型和模态，并训练推理模型进行实验比较。

Result: 实验比较了9个通用领域和5个中医专用LLM，提出了Ladder-Score评估方法。

Conclusion: TCM-Ladder为中医大语言模型提供了首个多模态评估基准，数据集和方法公开可用。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as an effective alternative medicine, has
been receiving increasing attention. In recent years, the rapid development of
large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has underscored the need for an
objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on
real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope
and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal
question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce
TCM-Ladder, the first multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for
evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset spans multiple core
disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas,
internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to
textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and
videos. The datasets were constructed using a combination of automated and
manual filtering processes and comprise 52,000+ questions in total. These
questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic
dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on
TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against 9 state-of-the-art
general domain and 5 leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on
the datasets. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method
specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses
answer quality regarding terminology usage and semantic expression. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate mainstream general domain and
TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and
leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com or

Abstract: Verifiers play a crucial role in large language model (LLM) reasoning, needed
by post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, reliable
verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a
well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written
edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose
HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this
pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS
with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing
tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points
higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating
LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as
large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model
training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的电子健康记录（EHR）解释需要专业知识和复杂推理，而RLVR在数学和编码领域的成功尚未在医疗领域得到验证。

Method: 采用两阶段解决方案：轻量级监督微调（SFT）注入缺失知识并稳定训练，随后通过RLVR强化正确结果并优化决策。

Result: 在MEDCALC、TREC CLINICAL TRIALS和EHRSHOT等临床任务中，EHRMIND显著提升了准确性、可解释性和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: EHRMIND为医疗领域应用RLVR提供了实用指导，增强了LLM在临床推理中的表现。

Abstract: We present EHRMIND, a practical recipe for adapting large language models
(LLMs) to complex clinical reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR). While RLVR has succeeded in mathematics and coding,
its application to healthcare contexts presents unique challenges due to the
specialized knowledge and reasoning required for electronic health record (EHR)
interpretation. Our pilot study on the MEDCALC benchmark reveals two key
failure modes: (1) misapplied knowledge, where models possess relevant medical
knowledge but apply it incorrectly, and (2) missing knowledge, where models
lack essential domain knowledge. To address these cases, EHRMIND applies a
two-stage solution: a lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up that
injects missing domain knowledge, stabilizes subsequent training, and
encourages structured, interpretable outputs; followed by RLVR, which
reinforces outcome correctness and refines the model's decision-making. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse clinical
applications, including medical calculations (MEDCALC), patient-trial matching
(TREC CLINICAL TRIALS), and disease diagnosis (EHRSHOT). EHRMIND delivers
consistent gains in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-task generalization.
These findings offer practical guidance for applying RLVR to enhance LLM
capabilities in healthcare settings.

Through a systematic review of nearly 300 publications from 2020--2024 across
major NLP conferences and workshops at *ACL, we identify a significant and
growing language gap in LLM safety research, with even high-resource
non-English languages receiving minimal attention. We further observe that
non-English languages are rarely studied as a standalone language and that
English safety research exhibits poor language documentation practice. To
motivate future research into multilingual safety, we make several
recommendations based on our survey, and we then pose three concrete future
directions on safety evaluation, training data generation, and crosslingual
safety generalization. Based on our survey and proposed directions, the field
can develop more robust, inclusive AI safety practices for diverse global

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对推理模型中冗余令牌的KV缓存压缩方法R-KV，显著减少了内存占用并提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型在自反思和链式推理中表现优异，但输出过长导致KV缓存过大，且现有压缩方法在链式推理中表现不佳。

Method: 提出R-KV方法，专注于压缩推理模型中的冗余令牌，保留性能的同时大幅减少KV缓存。

Result: R-KV仅用10%的KV缓存即可实现近100%的性能，甚至在某些情况下超过全缓存性能，同时节省90%内存并提高6.6倍吞吐量。

Conclusion: R-KV在数学推理数据集上优于现有KV缓存压缩方法，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection
and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long
outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference.
While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex
reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with
existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose
Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel
method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method
preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV
cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach
only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV
cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads
to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought
reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently
outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical

### [71] [CrossICL: Cross-Task In-Context Learning via Unsupervised Demonstration Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24143)
*Jinglong Gao,Xiao Ding,Lingxiao Zou,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrossICL提出了一种新的ICL范式，利用源任务的演示来指导目标任务，无需额外人工努力。通过两阶段对齐策略和大量实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICL依赖人工提供演示，但实际场景中用户可能无法或不愿提供。CrossICL旨在利用现有源任务演示解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了两阶段对齐策略以减少任务间干扰，并在875个NLP任务和6种LLM（包括GPT-4o）上进行了全面实验。

Result: 实验证明CrossICL有效，并提供了关于跨任务演示选择标准和任务间干扰类型的见解。

Conclusion: CrossICL为ICL提供了一种无需人工干预的可靠方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) with demonstrations. However, obtaining these demonstrations primarily
relies on manual effort. In most real-world scenarios, users are often
unwilling or unable to provide such demonstrations. Inspired by the human
analogy, we explore a new ICL paradigm CrossICL to study how to utilize
existing source task demonstrations in the ICL for target tasks, thereby
obtaining reliable guidance without any additional manual effort. To explore
this, we first design a two-stage alignment strategy to mitigate the
interference caused by gaps across tasks, as the foundation for our
experimental exploration. Based on it, we conduct comprehensive exploration of
CrossICL, with 875 NLP tasks from the Super-NI benchmark and six types of LLMs,
including GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CrossICL and provide valuable insights on questions like the criteria for
selecting cross-task demonstrations, as well as the types of task-gap-induced
interference in CrossICL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，增强语言模型的理性并不总是提升性能，有时会降低性能或提高可靠性，且性能与可靠性改进之间存在线性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨理性增强对语言模型性能和可靠性的实际影响，挑战现有观点。

Method: 通过全面调查，分析理性对模型性能和可靠性的影响，并引入任务内在难度的视角。

Result: 1) 理性有时会降低模型性能；2) 理性有时能提高模型可靠性；3) 性能与可靠性改进之间存在线性关系，且受任务难度驱动。

Conclusion: 研究为理性在语言模型中的广泛应用提供了指导，并对模型与人类思维的显式对齐提出了关键启示。

Abstract: Training language models with rationales augmentation has been shown to be
beneficial in many existing works. In this paper, we identify that such a
prevailing view does not hold consistently. We conduct comprehensive
investigations to thoroughly inspect the impact of rationales on model
performance as well as a novel perspective of model reliability. The results
lead to several key findings that add new insights upon existing
understandings: 1) Rationales can, at times, deteriorate model performance; 2)
Rationales can, at times, improve model reliability, even outperforming their
untrained counterparts; 3) A linear correspondence exists in between the
performance and reliability improvements, while both are driven by the
intrinsic difficulty of the task. These findings provide informative
regulations on the broad utilization of rationales and raise critical
implications on the procedure of explicitly aligning language models with
implicit human thoughts. Codes can be found at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LKD-KGC的无监督领域知识图谱构建框架，通过分析文档库推断知识依赖关系，并利用LLM驱动的优先级确定处理顺序，显著提升了构建效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域特定知识图谱（KGs）的手动构建效率低下且依赖专业知识，现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法受限于手动定义的模式、单文档处理和公共领域参考，难以应对复杂知识依赖和领域特异性。

Method: LKD-KGC框架通过无监督方式分析文档库，推断知识依赖关系，利用LLM驱动优先级确定处理顺序，并自回归生成实体模式，无需预定义结构或外部知识。

Result: 实验表明，LKD-KGC在精度和召回率上比现有方法提升10%至20%，能够构建高质量的领域特定知识图谱。

Conclusion: LKD-KGC为领域特定知识图谱构建提供了一种高效、无监督的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) structure real-world entities and their relationships
into triples, enhancing machine reasoning for various tasks. While
domain-specific KGs offer substantial benefits, their manual construction is
often inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Recent approaches for
knowledge graph construction (KGC) based on large language models (LLMs), such
as schema-guided KGC and reference knowledge integration, have proven
efficient. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on manually
defined schema, single-document processing, and public-domain references,
making them less effective for domain-specific corpora that exhibit complex
knowledge dependencies and specificity, as well as limited reference knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose LKD-KGC, a novel framework for
unsupervised domain-specific KG construction. LKD-KGC autonomously analyzes
document repositories to infer knowledge dependencies, determines optimal
processing sequences via LLM driven prioritization, and autoregressively
generates entity schema by integrating hierarchical inter-document contexts.
This schema guides the unsupervised extraction of entities and relationships,
eliminating reliance on predefined structures or external knowledge. Extensive
experiments show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, LKD-KGC
generally achieves improvements of 10% to 20% in both precision and recall
rate, demonstrating its potential in constructing high-quality domain-specific
KGs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Mixed-R1框架，通过混合奖励函数设计和混合数据集（Mixed-45K）解决多源MLLM任务的稳定强化学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多专注于单一任务（如数学问题或图表分析），缺乏对多源MLLM任务的统一解决方案。

Method: 设计Mixed-45K数据集和Mixed-Reward奖励函数（包括匹配奖励、图表奖励、IoU奖励和开放奖励BMAS）。

Result: 实验证明Mixed-R1在多种MLLM（如Qwen2.5-VL和Intern-VL）上有效。

Conclusion: Mixed-R1为多源MLLM任务提供了一种统一的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have successfully demonstrated
the emergence of reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL).
Although recent efforts leverage group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for
MLLMs post-training, they constantly explore one specific aspect, such as
grounding tasks, math problems, or chart analysis. There are no works that can
leverage multi-source MLLM tasks for stable reinforcement learning. In this
work, we present a unified perspective to solve this problem. We present
Mixed-R1, a unified yet straightforward framework that contains a mixed reward
function design (Mixed-Reward) and a mixed post-training dataset (Mixed-45K).
We first design a data engine to select high-quality examples to build the
Mixed-45K post-training dataset. Then, we present a Mixed-Reward design, which
contains various reward functions for various MLLM tasks. In particular, it has
four different reward functions: matching reward for binary answer or
multiple-choice problems, chart reward for chart-aware datasets, IoU reward for
grounding problems, and open-ended reward for long-form text responses such as
caption datasets. To handle the various long-form text content, we propose a
new open-ended reward named Bidirectional Max-Average Similarity (BMAS) by
leveraging tokenizer embedding matching between the generated response and the
ground truth. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed
method on various MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL and Intern-VL on various sizes.

TL;DR: Tag-Evol是一种基于知识标签的指令演化方法，相比固定策略的现有方法，它更高效且能生成更多样化和挑战性的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定策略，需要手动设计且形式单一，迭代演化获取困难样本成本高。

Method: Tag-Evol通过注入不同知识标签组合实现可控演化。

Result: 实验表明，Tag-Evol生成的数据质量显著优于其他方法，且更高效、多样化和具有挑战性。

Conclusion: Tag-Evol是一种高效且多样化的指令演化框架，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Evol-Instruct has made significant improvements as a data synthesis method in
several areas. Existing methods typically rely on a fixed set of strategies to
evolve, which require manual design and are monolithic in form. In addition,
iterative evolution also makes the acquisition of hard samples expensive. In
view of this, we propose the Tag-Evol framework, a more diverse and efficient
instruction evolving method. Specifically, Tag-Evol uses diverse and specific
knowledge tags as strategies to achieve controlled evolution by injecting
different combinations of tags into the original instructions. Experiments with
multiple backbones in diverse domain benchmarks show that the proposed method
generates significantly better evolved data than other methods. Furthermore, we
conduct a thorough analysis of the evolved data, demonstrating that Tag-Evol is
not only efficient but also generates more diverse and challenging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA合并方法适应性有限，且未解决低资源问题，因此提出新方法以优化参数调整和任务适应性。

Method: 通过微调目标任务的少量数据，更新和修剪LoRA参数，实现更细粒度的调整。

Result: 在多个领域和语言的实验中，新方法显著提升了任务适应性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的LoRA合并方法在低资源语言生成任务中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This study proposes a simple yet effective LoRA merge method to achieve LLM
adaptation for low-resource language generation tasks. The LoRA merge
technique, which integrates multiple LoRA modules trained on different tasks,
has gained attention as an effective and efficient approach for adapting LLMs
to target tasks. However, previous methods are limited in adaptability as they
keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has
been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes
LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows
finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task
adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as
a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of
English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves
significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous
methods.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了传统观点，认为大语言模型（LLM）的错误集中在少数关键令牌上，而非均匀分布。通过识别这些关键令牌，提出了一种新的可靠性公式，并设计了针对性的策略，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为LLM的可靠性随序列长度呈指数衰减，但研究发现错误集中在少数关键令牌上，这为提升模型性能提供了新思路。

Method: 通过区分高影响力令牌与可预测令牌，提出新的可靠性公式，并设计框架，包括动态计算分配和多路径探索等策略。

Result: 研究表明，长上下文性能主要依赖于准确处理少数关键语义决策点，而非均匀令牌级准确性，从而显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种从粗放扩展转向战略推理的新框架，为更强大高效的语言系统开辟了路径，超越了传统的指数衰减假设。

Abstract: The prevailing assumption of an exponential decay in large language model
(LLM) reliability with sequence length, predicated on independent per-token
error probabilities, posits an inherent limitation for long autoregressive
outputs. Our research fundamentally challenges this view by synthesizing
emerging evidence that LLM errors are not uniformly distributed but are
concentrated at sparse "key tokens" ($5-10\%$ of total tokens) representing
critical decision junctions. By distinguishing these high-impact tokens from
the increasingly predictable majority, we introduce a new reliability formula
explaining the sustained coherence of modern LLMs over thousands of tokens.
Converging research streams reveal that long-context performance primarily
depends on accurately navigating a few crucial semantic decision points rather
than on uniform token-level accuracy, enabling targeted strategies that
significantly outperform brute-force approaches. We thus propose a framework
for next-generation systems centered on selective preservation of semantically
vital tokens, dynamic computational allocation at uncertain decision
boundaries, multi-path exploration at ambiguities, and architectures aligned
with natural semantic domains. This marks a fundamental shift from raw scaling
to strategic reasoning, promising breakthrough performance without
proportionate computational scaling and offering a more nuanced understanding
that supersedes the exponential decay hypothesis, thereby opening pathways
toward substantially more powerful and efficient language systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法需要额外训练模块且兼容性差，CLaSp旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用上下文层跳过策略，动态编程算法优化层跳过过程，利用完整隐藏状态作为目标。

Result: 在LLaMA3系列模型上实现1.3x~1.7x加速，且不改变生成文本的原始分布。

Conclusion: CLaSp是一种高效、兼容性强的自推测解码方法，适用于多样化下游任务。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding
process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges
on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However,
existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be
trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across
various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping
strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not
require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a
plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to
construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic
programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging
the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective.
This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each
verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers.
Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp
achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the
original distribution of the generated text.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于直觉模糊集（IFS）的新框架，用于建模和聚合人类偏好数据，显著提升了标注一致性和数据质量，并在下游任务中提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类偏好标注方法（如SBS）存在不确定性、标注者分歧和判断复杂性等问题，亟需更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用直觉模糊集（IFS）建模偏好，通过隶属度、非隶属度和犹豫度捕捉人类判断的复杂性，并开发了新的标注协议和聚合方法。

Result: 实验表明，IFS方法显著提升了标注一致性（减少疲劳）和数据质量，下游任务中模型胜率提高12.3%，标注时间减少15.7%。

Conclusion: IFS框架为处理人类偏好标注中的不确定性提供了理论支持，并为大规模LLM训练提供了实用价值。

Abstract: The quality of human preference data is crucial for training and evaluating
large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) scenarios. Traditional
side-by-side (SBS) annotation approaches often struggle with inherent
uncertainty, annotator disagreement, and the complexity of preference
judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework based on intuitionistic
fuzzy sets (IFS) for modeling and aggregating human preferences in LLM data
annotation tasks. Our approach captures not only the degree of preference but
also the uncertainty and hesitation inherent in human judgment through
membership, non-membership, and hesitation degrees. We propose an IFS-based
annotation protocol that enables more nuanced preference modeling, develops
aggregation methods for handling annotator disagreement, and introduces quality
metrics for preference data assessment. Experimental validation on multiple
datasets demonstrates that our IFS-based approach significantly improves
annotation consistency, reduces annotator fatigue, and produces higher-quality
preference data compared to traditional binary and Likert-scale methods. The
resulting preference datasets lead to improved model performance in downstream
tasks, with 12.3\% improvement in win-rate against baseline models and 15.7\%
reduction in annotation time. Our framework provides a principled approach to
handling uncertainty in human preference annotation and offers practical
benefits for large-scale LLM training.

Abstract: Any-to-any generative models aim to enable seamless interpretation and
generation across multiple modalities within a unified framework, yet their
ability to preserve relationships across modalities remains uncertain. Do
unified models truly achieve cross-modal coherence, or is this coherence merely
perceived? To explore this, we introduce ACON, a dataset of 1,000 images (500
newly contributed) paired with captions, editing instructions, and Q&A pairs to
evaluate cross-modal transfers rigorously. Using three consistency
criteria-cyclic consistency, forward equivariance, and conjugated
equivariance-our experiments reveal that any-to-any models do not consistently
demonstrate greater cross-modal consistency than specialized models in
pointwise evaluations such as cyclic consistency. However, equivariance
evaluations uncover weak but observable consistency through structured analyses
of the intermediate latent space enabled by multiple editing operations. We
release our code and data at https://github.com/JiwanChung/ACON.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半结构化推理模型（SSRM），通过生成类似Python语法的推理痕迹，提高大型语言模型（LLM）推理的可分析性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理痕迹中的错误和偏见难以检测的问题。

Method: 引入SSRM，采用半结构化的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理格式，生成非可执行但结构化的推理痕迹。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，SSRM表现优于基线模型近十个百分点，同时在跨领域医学任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 半结构化推理更易于分析，可通过手工或学习型审计自动检测推理错误。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at reasoning, the
problem of "faithfulness" persists: LLM "reasoning traces" can contain errors
and omissions that are difficult to detect, and may obscure biases in model
outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning
Models (SSRMs), which internalize a semi-structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning format within the model. Our SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a
Pythonic syntax. While SSRM traces are not executable, they adopt a restricted,
task-specific vocabulary to name distinct reasoning steps, and to mark each
step's inputs and outputs. Through extensive evaluation on ten benchmarks,
SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generality: they outperform comparably
sized baselines by nearly ten percentage points on in-domain tasks while
remaining competitive with specialized models on out-of-domain medical
benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that semi-structured reasoning is more
amenable to analysis: in particular, they can be automatically audited to
identify reasoning flaws. We explore both hand-crafted structured audits, which
detect task-specific problematic reasoning patterns, and learned typicality
audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning patterns, and show that
both audits can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors.

Conclusion: ERU-KG在无监督关键词生成中具有高效性和实用性，并能灵活适应不同应用需求。

Abstract: Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent
years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined
importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In
addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems,
we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that
consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates
the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those
candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model
informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and
titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of
documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness
of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the
need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its
effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised
baselines and achieving on average 89\% of the performance of a supervised
model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility,
we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases
generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document
expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the
fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can
switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting
hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.

Conclusion: 结构化报告生成任务和SRR-BERT模型显著提高了报告的清晰度和一致性，为临床评估提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray (CXR) images has the
potential to improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiologists' workload.
However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert
Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and
unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and
evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically
meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances
of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured
Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text
radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency,
and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring
reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured
reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained
disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and
clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality,
we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease
taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured
clinical reporting. We validate our dataset through a reader study conducted by
five board-certified radiologists and extensive benchmarking experiments.

Motivation: 流式逆向文本归一化（ITN）在流式自动语音识别（ASR）中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在低资源和有限上下文场景下，存在准确性、效率和适应性挑战。

Method: 采用预训练语言模型，结合动态上下文感知技术，动态调整块大小并整合右上下文信息，以提升流式ITN的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为流式ASR系统提供了高效且准确的ITN解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into well-formatted written text, enhancing
both readability and usability. Despite its importance, the integration of
streaming ITN within streaming ASR remains largely unexplored due to challenges
in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in low-resource and
limited-context scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a streaming pretrained
language model for ITN, leveraging pretrained linguistic representations for
improved robustness. To address streaming constraints, we propose Dynamic
Context-Aware during training and inference, enabling adaptive chunk size
adjustments and the integration of right-context information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to
non-streaming ITN and surpasses existing streaming ITN models on a Vietnamese
dataset, all while maintaining low latency, ensuring seamless integration into
ASR systems.

TL;DR: APEX方法通过扩展优势参数比例提升大语言模型性能，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型参数增加虽提升性能但带来计算负担，优势参数对性能起关键作用。

Method: 提出APEX方法，逐步扩展优势参数至劣势参数空间，提高其比例。

Result: 指令微调中APEX仅用52%参数优于全参数调优；持续预训练中仅需33%数据达到相同困惑度。

Conclusion: APEX通过优化参数分布显著提升模型效率与性能。

Abstract: Although scaling up the number of trainable parameters in both pre-training
and fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of large language
models, it also leads to increased computational overhead. When delving into
the parameter difference, we find that a subset of parameters, termed
advantageous parameters, plays a crucial role in determining model performance.
Further analysis reveals that stronger models tend to possess more such
parameters. In this paper, we propose Advantageous Parameter EXpansion Training
(APEX), a method that progressively expands advantageous parameters into the
space of disadvantageous ones, thereby increasing their proportion and
enhancing training effectiveness. Further theoretical analysis from the
perspective of matrix effective rank explains the performance gains of APEX.
Extensive experiments on both instruction tuning and continued pre-training
demonstrate that, in instruction tuning, APEX outperforms full-parameter tuning
while using only 52% of the trainable parameters. In continued pre-training,
APEX achieves the same perplexity level as conventional training with just 33%

*Nir Endy,Idan Daniel Grosbard,Yuval Ran-Milo,Yonatan Slutzky,Itay Tshuva,Raja Giryes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于Mamba状态空间模型（SSM）的语言模型中事实信息的流动，通过理论与实证方法将其与Transformer架构及其注意力机制联系起来，并利用Attention Knockout方法分析信息传递与定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Mamba模型与Transformer模型在信息流动上的异同，揭示语言模型内部操作的普遍性与特殊性。

Method: 采用Attention Knockout方法，分析Mamba-1和Mamba-2模型中信息的传递与定位，比较其与Transformer模型的差异。

Result: 发现部分现象在Mamba与Transformer模型中表现不同，而另一些则普遍存在，表明这些可能是语言模型的固有特性。

Conclusion: 通过Mamba的结构化分解，揭示了信息交换与特征增强的机制，为理解Mamba内部操作提供了统一视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space
Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical
connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms.
Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques
originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout
methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information
is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of
subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some
phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others
appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be
inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured
factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable
token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering
a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（G-SFT和C-RL），用于提升多轮对话系统的主动引导能力，解决用户目标动态适应和实时交互低延迟的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话系统中需要动态适应用户目标变化并保持低延迟，但目前系统存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：G-SFT（目标自适应监督微调）动态跟踪用户目标并轻量化模型；C-RL（点击导向强化学习）通过用户点击信号优化交互质量。

Result: 离线评估准确率提升23.95%，在线点击率提升149.06%，推理延迟降低69.55%。

Conclusion: 该框架在多轮对话系统中实现了目标跟踪和交互优化的互补，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
multi-turn conversation systems, emphasizing the need for proactive guidance to
enhance users' interactions. However, these systems face challenges in
dynamically adapting to shifts in users' goals and maintaining low latency for
real-time interactions. In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale
multi-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide
proactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning
(G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal
shifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also
incorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a
lightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented
Reinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically
constructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves
click-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase
architecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal
tracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven
reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
achieves 86.10% accuracy in offline evaluation (+23.95% over baseline) and
25.28% CTR in online deployment (149.06% relative improvement), while reducing
inference latency by 69.55% through scalable knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 心智理论（ToM）推理对复杂社交互动至关重要，研究旨在探索ToM在人类-AI交互和合作决策中的作用。

Method: 使用最后通牒游戏作为实验环境，初始化具有不同亲社会信念（贪婪、公平、无私）的LLM代理，并应用链式思维（CoT）和不同ToM水平的推理方法。

Result: 2,700次模拟结果显示，ToM推理提高了行为对齐、决策一致性和谈判结果，推理模型表现有限。

Conclusion: ToM推理在增强人类-AI交互和合作决策中发挥重要作用，研究结果为相关领域提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in simulating human
behaviors and performing theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning, a crucial skill for
complex social interactions. In this study, we investigate the role of ToM
reasoning in aligning agentic behaviors with human norms in negotiation tasks,
using the ultimatum game as a controlled environment. We initialized LLM agents
with different prosocial beliefs (including Greedy, Fair, and Selfless) and
reasoning methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) and varying ToM levels, and
examined their decision-making processes across diverse LLMs, including
reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Qwen 32B. Results from
2,700 simulations indicated that ToM reasoning enhances behavior alignment,
decision-making consistency, and negotiation outcomes. Consistent with previous
findings, reasoning models exhibit limited capability compared to models with
ToM reasoning, different roles of the game benefits with different orders of
ToM reasoning. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ToM's role in
enhancing human-AI interaction and cooperative decision-making. The code used

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）性能提升，但训练数据不透明可能导致评估集重叠，影响结果公平性。现有泄漏检测方法未在受控条件下评估。

Method: 比较排列和n-gram方法，提出semi-half question方法，改进技术以支持实例级检测，清理数据集并重新评估LLM。

Result: n-gram方法F1得分最高，清理后的数据集和重新评估结果更可靠。

Conclusion: 建议将污染检查作为标准步骤，以提高评估的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to improve, as
reflected in rising scores on standard benchmarks. However, the lack of
transparency around training data raises concerns about potential overlap with
evaluation sets and the fairness of reported results. Although prior work has
proposed methods for detecting data leakage, these approaches primarily focus
on identifying outliers and have not been evaluated under controlled simulated
leakage conditions. In this work, we compare existing leakage detection
techniques, namely permutation and n-gram-based methods, under a continual
pretraining setup that simulates real-world leakage scenarios, and additionally
explore a lightweight method we call semi-half question. Although semi-half
offers a low-cost alternative, our analysis shows that the n-gram method
consistently achieves the highest F1-score. We also refine these techniques to
support instance-level detection and reduce computational overhead. Leveraging
the best-performing method, we create cleaned versions of MMLU and HellaSwag,
and re-evaluate several LLMs. Our findings present a practical path toward more
reliable and transparent evaluations, and we recommend contamination checks as
a standard step before releasing benchmark results.

Conclusion: 通过改进LLM-TP混合架构，论文显著提升了NLI解释的忠实性和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent
work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with
theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI
explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into
machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk
of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded
by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient
precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and
robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate
issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates
strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)
efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,
(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured
proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback
for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree
using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant
improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation
refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover,
we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can
substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations
required for successful verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在科学知识更新方面的局限性，确保其知识能够与时俱进。

Method: 提出ScienceMeter框架，定义三个指标（知识保留、获取、预测），并在多领域数据集上评估五种知识更新方法。

Result: 最佳方法仅保留85.9%现有知识，获取71.7%新知识，预测37.7%未来知识。推理方法适用于大模型，小模型需训练。

Conclusion: 现有科学知识更新方法仍不完善，开发更鲁棒的机制至关重要且具挑战性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support scientific
research, but their knowledge of scientific advancements can quickly become
outdated. We introduce ScienceMeter, a new framework for evaluating scientific
knowledge update methods over scientific knowledge spanning the past, present,
and future. ScienceMeter defines three metrics: knowledge preservation, the
extent to which models' understanding of previously learned papers are
preserved; knowledge acquisition, how well scientific claims from newly
introduced papers are acquired; and knowledge projection, the ability of the
updated model to anticipate or generalize to related scientific claims that may
emerge in the future. Using ScienceMeter, we examine the scientific knowledge
of LLMs on claim judgment and generation tasks across a curated dataset of
15,444 scientific papers and 30,888 scientific claims from ten domains
including medicine, biology, materials science, and computer science. We
evaluate five representative knowledge update approaches including training-
and inference-time methods. With extensive experiments, we find that the
best-performing knowledge update methods can preserve only 85.9% of existing
knowledge, acquire 71.7% of new knowledge, and project 37.7% of future
knowledge. Inference-based methods work for larger models, whereas smaller
models require training to achieve comparable performance. Cross-domain
analysis reveals that performance on these objectives is correlated. Even when
applying on specialized scientific LLMs, existing knowledge update methods fail
to achieve these objectives collectively, underscoring that developing robust
scientific knowledge update mechanisms is both crucial and challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在长文本修改中存在不必要修改和遗漏关键修改的问题。

Method: 提出HiCaM框架，结合层次化摘要树和因果图。

Result: 在多领域数据集上评估，性能显著优于现有LLMs，胜率达79.50%。

Conclusion: HiCaM在多个模型和领域中表现一致优越，验证了其全面性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. However, when handling long-form text modification tasks, they still
face two major problems: (1) producing undesired modifications by
inappropriately altering or summarizing irrelevant content, and (2) missing
necessary modifications to implicitly related passages that are crucial for
maintaining document coherence. To address these issues, we propose HiCaM, a
Hierarchical-Causal Modification framework that operates through a hierarchical
summary tree and a causal graph. Furthermore, to evaluate HiCaM, we derive a
multi-domain dataset from various benchmarks, providing a resource for
assessing its effectiveness. Comprehensive evaluations on the dataset
demonstrate significant improvements over strong LLMs, with our method
achieving up to a 79.50\% win rate. These results highlight the
comprehensiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements
across multiple models and domains.

Abstract: User sentiment on social media reveals the underlying social trends, crises,

the imminent sentiment of an ongoing event is rarely studied. In this paper, we
address the problem of \textbf{sentiment forecasting} on social media to
predict the user's future sentiment in response to the development of the
event. We extract sentiment-related features to enhance the modeling skill and
propose a multi-perspective role-playing framework to simulate the process of
human response. Our preliminary results show significant improvement in
sentiment forecasting on both microscopic and macroscopic levels.

Result: 实验显示，DeepDiver框架显著提升了模型性能，使其在真实网络任务中表现接近更大规模的模型。

Conclusion: 论文通过SIS概念和DeepDiver框架，推动了LLMs在自适应信息检索中的发展，为未来研究提供了基准和数据集。

Abstract: Information seeking demands iterative evidence gathering and reflective
reasoning, yet large language models (LLMs) still struggle with it in open-web
question answering. Existing methods rely on static prompting rules or training
with Wikipedia-based corpora and retrieval environments, limiting adaptability
to the real-world web environment where ambiguity, conflicting evidence, and
noise are prevalent. These constrained training settings hinder LLMs from
learning to dynamically decide when and where to search, and how to adjust
search depth and frequency based on informational demands. We define this
missing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to
intensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than
settling on overconfident, under-verification answers.
  To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster
information-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle
consists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both
wiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by
encouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world
open-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner
empowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the
671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from
cold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present
that its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks
such as long-form writing. Our contributions advance adaptive information
seeking in LLMs and provide a valuable benchmark and dataset for future
research.

Method: 提出3种扰动策略和8种具体方法，构建数据集，测试9种SOTA模型，并探索ICL和SFT等增强方案。

Result: 发现LLMs对扰动后的多模态中文有毒内容检测能力较弱，且ICL或SFT可能导致模型过度修正。

Conclusion: 中文有毒内容检测需进一步优化模型以应对多模态扰动，避免过度修正。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is important but challenging.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
understanding Chinese, recent studies show that simple character substitutions
in toxic Chinese text can easily confuse the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. In
this paper, we highlight the multimodal nature of Chinese language as a key
challenge for deploying LLMs in toxic Chinese detection. First, we propose a
taxonomy of 3 perturbation strategies and 8 specific approaches in toxic
Chinese content. Then, we curate a dataset based on this taxonomy, and
benchmark 9 SOTA LLMs (from both the US and China) to assess if they can detect
perturbed toxic Chinese text. Additionally, we explore cost-effective
enhancement solutions like in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). Our results reveal two important findings. (1) LLMs are less capable of
detecting perturbed multimodal Chinese toxic contents. (2) ICL or SFT with a
small number of perturbed examples may cause the LLMs "overcorrect'':
misidentify many normal Chinese contents as toxic.

Motivation: 传统ASR错误校正方法效果有限，而直接使用LLM可能导致正确文本被错误修改。为解决这一问题，提出了RLLM-CF框架。

Method: RLLM-CF包括三个阶段：错误预检测、链式思维子任务迭代校正和推理过程验证，无需额外信息或模型微调。

Result: 在AISHELL-1、AISHELL-2和Librispeech数据集上，GPT-4o结合RLLM-CF框架显著降低了CER/WER（相对减少21%、11%、9%和11.4%）。

Conclusion: RLLM-CF框架有效解决了LLM在ASR错误校正中的幻觉问题，显著提升了校正效果。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct
recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional
approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that
eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs
will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of
the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM
Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error
pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3)
reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not
require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the
correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on
AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by
our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Abstract: Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and executing complex
tasks. However, developing robust agents presents significant challenges:
substantial engineering overhead, lack of standardized components, and
insufficient evaluation frameworks for fair comparison. We introduce Agent
Graph-based Orchestration for Reasoning and Assessment (AGORA), a flexible and
extensible framework that addresses these challenges through three key
contributions: (1) a modular architecture with a graph-based workflow engine,
efficient memory management, and clean component abstraction; (2) a
comprehensive suite of reusable agent algorithms implementing state-of-the-art
reasoning approaches; and (3) a rigorous evaluation framework enabling
systematic comparison across multiple dimensions. Through extensive experiments
on mathematical reasoning and multimodal tasks, we evaluate various agent
algorithms across different LLMs, revealing important insights about their
relative strengths and applicability. Our results demonstrate that while
sophisticated reasoning approaches can enhance agent capabilities, simpler
methods like Chain-of-Thought often exhibit robust performance with
significantly lower computational overhead. AGORA not only simplifies language
agent development but also establishes a foundation for reproducible agent
research through standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language (SL) videos
into spoken language text, thereby bridging the communication gap between the
sign and the spoken community. While most existing works focus on translating a
single sign language into a single spoken language (one-to-one SLT), leveraging
multilingual resources could mitigate low-resource issues and enhance
accessibility. However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to
language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages.
To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with
dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text
generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and
many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual
SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily.

Motivation: 探究零样本CoT推理的成功是否可以在推理完成前预测，以优化推理效率。

Method: 使用基于LLM表示的探测分类器和BERT基线进行比较，分析早期和后期推理步骤的信息价值，并进行早期停止实验。

Result: LLM表示在早期已包含关键信息，BERT基线依赖浅层语言线索表现较差。早期截断CoT仍优于无CoT，但性能不及完整推理。

Conclusion: 早期表示已足够预测推理成功，支持优化CoT效率的方法（如监督学习或强化学习）利用分类器指导早期停止。

Abstract: We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing
classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a
single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the
reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In
contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated
tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues
rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning
steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is
unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs
encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early
without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that
truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all,
though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like
supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains
could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is
effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping
to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.\footnote{Code and

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言推理方面表现优异，但其有限的参数记忆和易产生幻觉的问题限制了其在需要准确上下文推理的任务中的应用。因此，研究如何利用外部知识增强LLMs成为重要课题。

Method: 研究提出了一种分类法，将外部知识分为非结构化和结构化数据，并重点分析了结构化知识（表格和知识图谱）与LLMs的整合方法。

Result: 通过比较分析，研究揭示了在可解释性、可扩展性和性能之间的权衡，为开发可信且通用的知识增强型LLMs提供了见解。

Conclusion: 利用外部知识（尤其是结构化知识）可以有效增强LLMs的能力，但需权衡不同方法的优缺点以实现最佳效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced
natural-language reasoning. However, their limited parametric memory and
susceptibility to hallucination present persistent challenges for tasks
requiring accurate, context-based inference. To overcome these limitations, an
increasing number of studies have proposed leveraging external knowledge to
enhance LLMs. This study offers a systematic exploration of strategies for
using external knowledge to enhance LLMs, beginning with a taxonomy that
categorizes external knowledge into unstructured and structured data. We then
focus on structured knowledge, presenting distinct taxonomies for tables and
knowledge graphs (KGs), detailing their integration paradigms with LLMs, and
reviewing representative methods. Our comparative analysis further highlights
the trade-offs among interpretability, scalability, and performance, providing
insights for developing trustworthy and generalizable knowledge-enhanced LLMs.

TL;DR: ClueAnchor是一种通过线索锚定推理探索和优化来增强RAG的新框架，显著提高了推理的完整性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统未能充分利用检索到的文档，尤其是在证据隐晦、分散或被噪声掩盖时，导致推理不准确。

Method: ClueAnchor从检索内容中提取关键线索，基于不同知识配置生成多条推理路径，并通过奖励偏好优化选择最有效路径。

Result: 实验表明，ClueAnchor在推理完整性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有RAG基线，且对噪声或部分相关检索内容具有强韧性。

Conclusion: ClueAnchor能够在不依赖显式线索监督的情况下识别支持证据，提升了RAG系统的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs)
with external knowledge to improve factuality. However, existing RAG systems
frequently underutilize the retrieved documents, failing to extract and
integrate the key clues needed to support faithful and interpretable reasoning,
especially in cases where relevant evidence is implicit, scattered, or obscured
by noise. To address this issue, we propose ClueAnchor, a novel framework for
enhancing RAG via clue-anchored reasoning exploration and optimization.
ClueAnchor extracts key clues from retrieved content and generates multiple
reasoning paths based on different knowledge configurations, optimizing the
model by selecting the most effective one through reward-based preference
optimization. Experiments show that ClueAnchor significantly outperforms prior
RAG baselines in reasoning completeness and robustness. Further analysis
confirms its strong resilience to noisy or partially relevant retrieved
content, as well as its capability to identify supporting evidence even in the
absence of explicit clue supervision during inference.

### [102] [LLMs Are Globally Multilingual Yet Locally Monolingual: Exploring Knowledge Transfer via Language and Thought Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24409)
*Eojin Kang,Juae Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言大语言模型（LLMs）中跨语言事实知识传递的不一致问题，提出了一种基于语言与思维理论的L2T提示策略，通过实验挑战了英语优先的假设，并展示了L2T在训练中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言LLMs中跨语言事实知识传递的不一致性，探索非英语到英语的传递机制，以揭示语言与思维在模型中的绑定关系。

Method: 提出Language-to-Thought (L2T)提示策略，分析输入语言、内部认知过程与知识之间的关系，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，英语优先的方法并非总是最优，L2T策略能有效提升跨语言知识传递效果，且在训练中应用L2T可减少对输入语言的依赖。

Conclusion: L2T策略为跨语言知识传递提供了新视角，强调模型内部思维与任务知识的对齐是关键，未来可进一步探索其在训练中的应用。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for
leveraging information across languages, but their factual knowledge recall
remains inconsistent depending on the input language. While previous studies
have attempted to address this issue through English-based prompting and
evaluation, we explore non-English to English transfer via Language and Thought
Theory. This perspective allows us to examine language-thought binding in LLMs
and uncover why factual knowledge often fails to transfer effectively. We
propose the Language-to-Thought (L2T) prompting strategy, which analyzes the
relationship between input language, internal cognitive processes, and
knowledge. Experimental results challenge the assumption that English-based
approaches consistently outperform other languages and offer a novel insight
that aligning the model's internal thought with the knowledge required for the
task is critical for successful cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, we show
that applying L2T during training can alleviate LLMs' reliance on the input
language and facilitate cross-linguistic knowledge integration without
translation-based learning. Code and datasets will be available.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MMAFFBen，首个多语言多模态情感分析的开源基准，涵盖35种语言的文本、图像和视频，并评估了多种大型语言模型的情感理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但其在情感分析（如情感极性和情绪分类）中的能力尚未充分探索，主要由于缺乏全面评估基准和任务复杂性。

Method: 论文提出了MMAFFBen基准，包含四种情感分析任务，并构建了MMAFFIn数据集用于微调模型，进一步开发了MMAFFLM-3b和MMAFFLM-7b模型。

Result: 评估了包括GPT-4o-mini在内的多种代表性模型，系统比较了它们的情感理解能力。

Conclusion: MMAFFBen为多语言多模态情感分析提供了首个开源基准，填补了研究空白，并展示了模型的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models and vision-language models (which we jointly call LMs)
have transformed NLP and CV, demonstrating remarkable potential across various
fields. However, their capabilities in affective analysis (i.e. sentiment
analysis and emotion detection) remain underexplored. This gap is largely due
to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and the inherent
complexity of affective analysis tasks. In this paper, we introduce MMAFFBen,
the first extensive open-source benchmark for multilingual multimodal affective
analysis. MMAFFBen encompasses text, image, and video modalities across 35
languages, covering four key affective analysis tasks: sentiment polarity,
sentiment intensity, emotion classification, and emotion intensity. Moreover,
we construct the MMAFFIn dataset for fine-tuning LMs on affective analysis
tasks, and further develop MMAFFLM-3b and MMAFFLM-7b based on it. We evaluate
various representative LMs, including GPT-4o-mini, providing a systematic
comparison of their affective understanding capabilities. This project is

TL;DR: 研究比较了研究中创建的内容与真实社交媒体内容在情感表达上的差异，发现两者在长度、文本与图像依赖度及情感表达方式上存在显著不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨研究中创建的内容与真实内容在情感表达上的差异及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 收集并比较研究中创建的多模态社交媒体帖子与真实帖子，分析其在情感表达上的差异及模型表现。

Result: 研究中创建的帖子更长，更依赖文本而非图像表达情感，且更关注情感原型事件；两类数据在人口统计学上也有差异。

Conclusion: 研究中创建的数据对训练泛化能力强的模型有价值，但评估模型效果仍需真实数据。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires
data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by
asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the
real world, or create content fitting particular labels during the study.
Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and
presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is
unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and
how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine
multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several
dimensions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine
posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on
their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical
events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are
demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that
generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require
genuine data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）引导的子空间投影遗忘（SSPU）框架，用于精确、可解释且鲁棒的大语言模型知识遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存储大量信息，但缺乏选择性知识遗忘的有效方法，现有方法在可解释性或对抗性防御上表现不足。

Method: SSPU采用三阶段流程：数据驱动的层和特征选择、QR分解构建子空间、约束优化控制激活到无关子空间。

Result: 在WMDP-Cyber遗忘集和三个基准测试中，SSPU将有害知识准确率降低3.22%，并提升对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSPU通过可解释的子空间引导优化，实现了鲁棒且可控的模型行为，揭示了现有遗忘方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them
powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge
removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from
gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE)
steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense
against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection
Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive
targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise,
interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs
data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR
decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an
"irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE
features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss
and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In
experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU,
TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared
to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering
malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings
expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how
interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable
model behavior.

TL;DR: 研究表明，专业型人物角色（PBPs）能略微提升领域特定问答任务的准确性，而职业性格型人物角色（OPBPs）可能降低性能，即使与任务语义相关。人物角色的相关性并不保证知识有效利用，反而可能限制认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人物角色对领域特定问答任务的影响，尤其是专业型与职业性格型人物角色的差异。

Method: 引入两种人物角色（PBPs和OPBPs），通过多领域科学任务的实证评估分析其效果。

Result: PBPs略微提升准确性，OPBPs则可能降低性能。人物角色相关性不足以保证知识有效利用。

Conclusion: 未来研究可探索人物角色表征的细微差异如何引导LLMs，以更接近人类社交概念化的方式进行推理和知识检索。

Abstract: Recent studies on personas have improved the way Large Language Models (LLMs)
interact with users. However, the effect of personas on domain-specific
question-answering (QA) tasks remains a subject of debate. This study analyzes
whether personas enhance specialized QA performance by introducing two types of
persona: Profession-Based Personas (PBPs) (e.g., scientist), which directly
relate to domain expertise, and Occupational Personality-Based Personas (OPBPs)
(e.g., scientific person), which reflect cognitive tendencies rather than
explicit expertise. Through empirical evaluations across multiple scientific
domains, we demonstrate that while PBPs can slightly improve accuracy, OPBPs
often degrade performance, even when semantically related to the task. Our
findings suggest that persona relevance alone does not guarantee effective
knowledge utilization and that they may impose cognitive constraints that
hinder optimal knowledge application. Future research can explore how nuanced
distinctions in persona representations guide LLMs, potentially contributing to
reasoning and knowledge retrieval that more closely mirror human social
conceptualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言/多模态模型（LLMs/LMMs）难以保持与现实世界更新的知识一致性，导致灾难性遗忘问题。此前研究主要关注文本知识注入，缺乏对多模态演化知识注入的探索。

Method: 提出EVOKE基准，评估LMMs在多模态演化知识注入中的表现，并分析现有方法的性能。

Result: 发现现有知识注入方法在演化知识上表现不佳，监督微调会导致灾难性遗忘；文本知识增强和持续学习方法（如Replay和MoELoRA）能部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 当前知识注入方法在演化知识上存在局限性，需进一步研究更高效稳定的方法。

Abstract: Large language/multimodal models (LLMs/LMMs) store extensive pre-trained
knowledge but struggle to maintain consistency with real-world updates, making
it difficult to avoid catastrophic forgetting while acquiring evolving
knowledge. Previous work focused on constructing textual knowledge datasets and
exploring knowledge injection in LLMs, lacking exploration of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection in LMMs. To address this, we propose the EVOKE
benchmark to evaluate LMMs' ability to inject multimodal evolving knowledge in
real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection revealed two challenges: (1) Existing knowledge
injection methods perform terribly on evolving knowledge. (2) Supervised
fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting, particularly instruction following
ability is severely compromised. Additionally, we provide pathways and find
that: (1) Text knowledge augmentation during the training phase improves
performance, while image augmentation cannot achieve it. (2) Continual learning
methods, especially Replay and MoELoRA, effectively mitigate forgetting. Our
findings indicate that current knowledge injection methods have many
limitations on evolving knowledge, which motivates further research on more
efficient and stable knowledge injection methods.

Result: 小型专用语料库可生成有效表示；通用与专用语料库结合的效果取决于目标任务与专用语料库的分布相似性。

Conclusion: 预训练语料库的选择对表示质量至关重要，专用语料库在特定条件下表现优异。

Abstract: This empirical study analyzes the effects of the pre-training corpus on the
quality of learned transformer representations. We focus on the representation
quality induced solely through pre-training. Our experiments show that
pre-training on a small, specialized corpus can yield effective
representations, and that the success of combining a generic and a specialized
corpus depends on the distributional similarity between the target task and the
specialized corpus.

Method: 引入CaMMT数据集（包含5800组图像及平行标题），评估五种视觉语言模型在纯文本和文本+图像设置下的表现。

Result: 视觉上下文普遍提升翻译质量，尤其在处理文化特定项、歧义消除和性别正确使用方面。

Conclusion: 通过发布CaMMT，支持构建更符合文化细微差别和区域差异的多模态翻译系统。

Abstract: Cultural content poses challenges for machine translation systems due to the
differences in conceptualizations between cultures, where language alone may
fail to convey sufficient context to capture region-specific meanings. In this
work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal
translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800
triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional
languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs)
in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations,
we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially
in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct
gender usage. By releasing CaMMT, we aim to support broader efforts in building
and evaluating multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with
cultural nuance and regional variation.

Conclusion: VietMix及其方法提升了神经机器翻译的生态效度，为其他低资源语言对提供了框架。

Abstract: Machine translation systems fail when processing code-mixed inputs for
low-resource languages. We address this challenge by curating VietMix, a
parallel corpus of naturally occurring code-mixed Vietnamese text paired with
expert English translations. Augmenting this resource, we developed a
complementary synthetic data generation pipeline. This pipeline incorporates
filtering mechanisms to ensure syntactic plausibility and pragmatic
appropriateness in code-mixing patterns. Experimental validation shows our
naturalistic and complementary synthetic data boost models' performance,
measured by translation quality estimation scores, of up to 71.84 on COMETkiwi
and 81.77 on XCOMET. Triangulating positive results with LLM-based assessments,
augmented models are favored over seed fine-tuned counterparts in approximately
49% of judgments (54-56% excluding ties). VietMix and our augmentation
methodology advance ecological validity in neural MT evaluations and establish
a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other

Conclusion: 代码集成推理扩展了模型能力边界，同时提高了推理效率，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models
generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a
code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to
use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented
reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits,
tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning
dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to
improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for
code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training
strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building
tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive
experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model
demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive
baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and
effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as
the extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement
of reasoning efficiency through code integration. All data and code for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学和编码等需要系统2认知的领域表现优异，但在社交领域的认知发展仍待探索。社交领域需要结合系统1和系统2的认知模式，且具有独特的时间线。

Method: 提出Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning (TimeHC-RL)，通过五种后训练范式和两种测试时干预范式，在八个数据集上验证其有效性。

Result: TimeHC-RL在7B模型上表现优异，性能媲美DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI-O3等先进模型。

Conclusion: TimeHC-RL方法显著提升LLMs的社交智能，同时揭示了后训练和测试时干预对提升社交智能的重要价值。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
IQ-related domains that require careful thinking, such as mathematics and
coding. However, enhancing LLMs' cognitive development in social domains,
particularly from a post-training perspective, remains underexplored.
Recognizing that the social world follows a distinct timeline and requires a
richer blend of cognitive modes (from intuitive reactions (System 1) and
surface-level thinking to deliberate thinking (System 2)) than mathematics,
which primarily relies on System 2 cognition (careful, step-by-step reasoning),
we introduce Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning
(TimeHC-RL) for enhancing LLMs' social intelligence. In our experiments, we
systematically explore improving LLMs' social intelligence and validate the
effectiveness of the TimeHC-RL method, through five other post-training
paradigms and two test-time intervention paradigms on eight datasets with
diverse data patterns. Experimental results reveal the superiority of our
proposed TimeHC-RL method compared to the widely adopted System 2 RL method. It
gives the 7B backbone model wings, enabling it to rival the performance of
advanced models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O3. Additionally, the systematic
exploration from post-training and test-time interventions perspectives to
improve LLMs' social intelligence has uncovered several valuable insights.

Result: 实验表明，检测器容易被少量样本欺骗，检测性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需改进检测方法以增强对未见领域文本的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have
enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic content, raising concerns
about the potential for malicious use, such as misinformation and manipulation.
Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the
lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios.
In this work, we present a pipeline to test the resilience of state-of-the-art
MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed
adversarial attacks. To challenge the detectors, we fine-tune language models
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward
human-written text (HWT). This exploits the detectors' reliance on stylistic
clues, making new generations more challenging to detect. Additionally, we
analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and which features are
used by detectors to detect MGT texts. Our results show that detectors can be
easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in
detection performance. This highlights the importance of improving detection
methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts.

Method: 采用适配器融合和跨注意力微调预训练机器翻译模型，分析语言相关性与适配器性能的关系。

Result: 性能显著提升，但语言相关性与适配器性能无显著关联，随机初始化的适配器同样有效。

Conclusion: 适配器的作用主要是参数正则化，而非信息传递，表明神经语言处理方法的成功因素复杂且不总是依赖语言学知识。

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer from related high-resource languages is a
well-established strategy to enhance low-resource language technologies. Prior
work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource
machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping
method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to
leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which
exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic
dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines.
However, we find that linguistic relatedness -- or even a lack thereof -- does
not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our
cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly
initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting
lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer.
We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis. Our findings
underscore the reality that neural language processing involves many success
factors, and that not all neural methods leverage linguistic knowledge in
intuitive ways.

Abstract: LLMs often excel on standard benchmarks but falter on real-world tasks. We
introduce DeepQuestion, a scalable automated framework that augments existing
datasets based on Bloom's taxonomy and creates novel questions that trace
original solution paths to probe evaluative and creative skills. Extensive
experiments across ten open-source and proprietary models, covering both
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, reveal substantial performance drops (even
up to 70% accuracy loss) on higher-order tasks, underscoring persistent gaps in
deep reasoning. Our work highlights the need for cognitively diverse benchmarks
to advance LLM progress. DeepQuestion and related datasets will be released
upon acceptance of the paper.

*Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis,Jason Liartis,Kristina Rose,Antoine Isaac,Giorgos Stamou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一种AI工具，用于检测文化遗产数据中的冒犯性术语并提供背景信息，帮助机构创建更具包容性的收藏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数据中可能存在历史偏见和冒犯性描述，机构在管理这些数据时面临挑战。

Method: 结合多语言词汇、传统NLP技术和大型语言模型（LLMs），开发了一个AI工具。

Result: 工具已处理790万条记录，检测并提供了冒犯性术语的背景信息。

Conclusion: 工具旨在揭示偏见并提供可操作的建议，而非直接删除术语，以促进文化遗产数据的包容性和可访问性。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the
history, traditions, and identities of societies, and shaping our understanding
of the past and present. However, many CH collections contain outdated or
offensive descriptions that reflect historical biases. CH Institutions (CHIs)
face significant challenges in curating these data due to the vast scale and
complexity of the task. To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that
detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into
their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a
multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers,
and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and Large Language
Models (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH
platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the
contentious terms detected in their metadata. Rather than erasing these terms,
our approach seeks to inform, making biases visible and providing actionable
insights for creating more inclusive and accessible CH collections.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中不同人格特征在表示空间中的编码方式，发现人格特征主要在解码器后三分之一层中表现出显著差异，且不同伦理观点存在重叠，而政治意识形态则更分散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何内部表示不同人格特征，以优化模型输出中对特定人类特征的调控。

Method: 使用降维和模式识别方法分析LLMs的表示空间，聚焦于解码器层的激活模式。

Result: 人格特征在解码器后三分之一层中差异显著；伦理观点存在重叠，政治意识形态则更分散。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs内部表示信息的方式，为未来优化模型输出提供了依据。

Abstract: We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of
human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation
space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and
pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the
greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the
activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are
encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding
spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the
analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within
the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for
specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism --
suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like
conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions.
These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally
represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation
of specific human traits in LLM outputs. Warning: This paper includes
potentially offensive sample statements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Beagle是一种基于交叉注意力的Transformer解码器SD模型，性能与领先的自注意力SD模型相当，但简化了架构并提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SD方法依赖紧密耦合的自注意力Transformer解码器，导致复杂性和泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出Budget EAGLE (Beagle)，采用交叉注意力Transformer解码器，无需辅助组件，并提出两阶段块注意力训练方法。

Result: Beagle在推理速度和训练效率上优于EAGLE-v2，且内存使用稳定。

Conclusion: Beagle为SD提供了一种简化且高效的替代架构。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating
inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and
target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically
rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often
augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them
increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We
present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge,
cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on
par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need
for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving
training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time
simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose
Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training
stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle
achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than
EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative
decoding.

TL;DR: A*-Thought是一种基于树搜索的统一框架，通过A*搜索算法和特定成本函数高效压缩推理链，提升大型推理模型的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩推理链时往往导致性能下降，A*-Thought旨在高效识别和提取关键推理步骤，平衡性能与效率。

Method: 将推理过程建模为搜索树，结合A*算法和双向重要性估计机制，压缩推理链并确定高信息密度、低成本的路径。

Result: 在数学任务中，A*-Thought显著提升性能（如QwQ-32B性能提升2.39倍）并减少输出长度（高预算下减少50%）。

Conclusion: A*-Thought在性能和效率间取得平衡，具有通用性，适用于多种大型推理模型。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve superior performance by extending the
thought length. However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced
efficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of
overthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the
Chain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address
this problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified
framework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the
extensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the
reasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a
reasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search
algorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can
efficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with
high information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a
bidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this
search process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive
experiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively
balances performance and efficiency over a huge search space. Specifically,
A*-Thought can improve the performance of QwQ-32B by 2.39$\times$ with
low-budget and reduce the length of the output token by nearly 50% with
high-budget. The proposed method is also compatible with several other LRMs,
demonstrating its generalization capability. The code can be accessed at:

Method: CREFT通过知识蒸馏构建基础角色图，并迭代优化角色组成、关系提取、角色识别和分组分配。

Result: 在韩剧数据集上的实验表明，CREFT在准确性和完整性上显著优于单代理LLM基线。

Conclusion: CREFT通过系统可视化角色网络，提升了叙事理解和脚本审查效率，对娱乐、出版和教育领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Understanding complex character relations is crucial for narrative analysis
and efficient script evaluation, yet existing extraction methods often fail to
handle long-form narratives with nuanced interactions. To address this
challenge, we present CREFT, a novel sequential framework leveraging
specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents. First, CREFT builds a base
character graph through knowledge distillation, then iteratively refines
character composition, relation extraction, role identification, and group
assignments. Experiments on a curated Korean drama dataset demonstrate that
CREFT significantly outperforms single-agent LLM baselines in both accuracy and
completeness. By systematically visualizing character networks, CREFT
streamlines narrative comprehension and accelerates script review -- offering
substantial benefits to the entertainment, publishing, and educational sectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的KE自动化工具的标准评估方法，影响了方法严谨性和结果的可比性。

Method: 开发了Bench4KE系统，包含精选的CQ数据集和相似性度量套件，用于评估自动生成的CQs质量。

Result: 对四种基于LLMs的CQ生成系统进行了比较分析，为未来研究提供了基准。

Conclusion: Bench4KE填补了KE自动化工具评估的空白，并支持其他KE任务的扩展。

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation,
a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and
tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the
evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the
methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To
address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking
system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that
generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology
engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE
provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world
ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality
of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ
generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future
research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation
tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and
datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Ioannis Tsiamas,David Dale,Marta R. Costa-jussà*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字符的方法，通过跨语言和跨模态知识转移，提升低资源语言的翻译能力，并在文本和语音翻译中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译系统仅覆盖5%的语言，需扩展至低资源语言，依赖数据高效方法。

Method: 采用字符级编码器，结合SONAR多语言嵌入空间和教师-学生方法，利用ASR数据训练适配器。

Result: 在75种语言的文本翻译中表现优于传统子词模型，语音翻译在33种语言上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 字符级方法在低资源和零-shot场景下具有优势，跨模态知识转移效果显著。

Abstract: Current translation systems, despite being highly multilingual, cover only 5%
of the world's languages. Expanding language coverage to the long-tail of
low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on
cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a
character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and
modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding
space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a
teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a
character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter
to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level
encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages.
Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+
demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language
transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them
in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability
to unseen languages. Our speech adaptation, maximizing knowledge transfer from
the text modality, achieves state-of-the-art results in speech-to-text
translation on the FLEURS benchmark on 33 languages, surpassing previous
supervised and cascade models, albeit being a zero-shot model with minimal
supervision from ASR data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在捕捉复杂情节、角色互动和主题连贯性方面存在挑战，需要一种更高效的方法来处理长篇幅叙事文本。

Method: 采用对话到描述的转换和分层多LLM摘要技术，优化文本处理和输出长度控制。

Result: 在书籍、电影和电视剧本上，BERTScore（F1）提升了30.0%，达到了新的最佳水平。

Conclusion: 多代理LLM框架在长篇幅内容处理中表现出色，为多样化叙事领域提供了可扩展的摘要解决方案。

Abstract: Summarizing long-form narratives--such as books, movies, and TV
scripts--requires capturing intricate plotlines, character interactions, and
thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We
introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization
that processes long-form text through a structured, sequential
pipeline--without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) Dialogue-to-Description Transformation: A narrative-specific
preprocessing method that standardizes character dialogue and descriptive text
into a unified format, improving coherence. (2) Hierarchical Multi-LLM
Summarization: A structured summarization pipeline that optimizes chunk
processing and controls output length for accurate, high-quality summaries. Our
method establishes a new state-of-the-art in narrative summarization, achieving
up to a 30.0% improvement in BERTScore (F1) across books, movies, and TV
scripts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-agent LLMs in
handling long-form content, offering a scalable approach for structured
summarization in diverse storytelling domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了GATE模型，用于阿拉伯语语义文本相似性任务，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语在语义文本相似性任务中缺乏高质量数据集和预训练模型，限制了研究进展。

Method: GATE采用Matryoshka表示学习和混合损失训练方法，结合阿拉伯语三元组数据集。

Result: GATE在STS基准测试中性能提升20-25%，优于包括OpenAI在内的更大模型。

Conclusion: GATE能有效捕捉阿拉伯语的独特语义细微差别，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a critical task in natural language
processing (NLP), enabling applications in retrieval, clustering, and
understanding semantic relationships between texts. However, research in this
area for the Arabic language remains limited due to the lack of high-quality
datasets and pre-trained models. This scarcity of resources has restricted the
accurate evaluation and advance of semantic similarity in Arabic text. This
paper introduces General Arabic Text Embedding (GATE) models that achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the Semantic Textual Similarity task within the
MTEB benchmark. GATE leverages Matryoshka Representation Learning and a hybrid
loss training approach with Arabic triplet datasets for Natural Language
Inference, which are essential for enhancing model performance in tasks that
demand fine-grained semantic understanding. GATE outperforms larger models,
including OpenAI, with a 20-25% performance improvement on STS benchmarks,
effectively capturing the unique semantic nuances of Arabic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨层归因算法，用于分析稀疏MoE架构的动态路由-专家交互，揭示了MoE模型的高效性和协作模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法无法捕捉稀疏MoE架构中的动态路由-专家交互，因此需要新的分析方法。

Method: 提出跨层归因算法，对比稀疏MoE架构（如Qwen 1.5-MoE）与密集模型（如Qwen 1.5-7B）。

Result: MoE模型通过“中期激活、后期放大”模式实现37%的层效率提升，并展示了专家协作和任务感知路由。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE模型的可解释性提供了新见解，平衡了效率、专业化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those
with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods
for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse
MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution
algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE,
Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mixtral-7B). Results
show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation,
late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers
refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement"
framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while
routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic
attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations
between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.
Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates
expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10
experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe
degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive
tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant
tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights
advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency,
specialization, and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症检测模型虽然能提供预测结果，但缺乏对预测的解释性，降低了系统的可信度。

Method: 采用掩蔽硬实例挖掘（MHIM）方法，通过掩蔽注意力权重，迫使模型关注更广泛的显著特征。

Result: 在泰语（Thai-Maywe）和英语（DAIC-WOZ）数据集上，MHIM显著提升了预测准确性和可解释性指标。

Conclusion: MHIM方法有效提升了抑郁症检测任务的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for improved explainability in
text-based depression detection. While offering predictive outcomes, current
solutions often overlook the understanding of model predictions which can
hinder trust in the system. We propose the use of Masked Hard Instance Mining
(MHIM) to enhance the explainability in the depression detection task. MHIM
strategically masks attention weights within the model, compelling it to
distribute attention across a wider range of salient features. We evaluate MHIM
on two datasets representing distinct languages: Thai (Thai-Maywe) and English
(DAIC-WOZ). Our results demonstrate that MHIM significantly improves
performance in terms of both prediction accuracy and explainability metrics.

TL;DR: 论文研究了对话代理如何通过利用对话双方的个性化信息（persona）提升对话一致性和多样性，并探讨了模型在适应对话对象时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注对话与给定个性化信息的对齐，而对话对象个性化信息的适应尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究评估了模型在三种情况下的表现：1）对齐对话双方的个性化信息；2）处理熟悉与不熟悉对话对象及话题的鲁棒性；3）额外微调对特定个性化对话的影响。

Result: 结果显示，利用对话对象的个性化信息可提升目标说话者的识别率，而屏蔽信息则相反。模型在话题上表现良好，但对不熟悉对话对象表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了对话对象个性化信息的重要性，并指出模型在零样本设置下可能简单复制传记细节，导致任务简化。

Abstract: Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly
improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus
has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to
the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we
investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with
both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when
dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the
impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We
evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing
the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both
LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing
information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue
generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the
recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although
models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar
interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy
biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在提出的基准数据集上优于其他方法，适用于想法检索和新颖性检测任务。

Conclusion: 论文展示了LLMs在新颖性检测中的潜力，并通过轻量级检索器实现了高效准确的想法检索。

Abstract: In an era of exponential scientific growth, identifying novel research ideas
is crucial and challenging in academia. Despite potential, the lack of an
appropriate benchmark dataset hinders the research of novelty detection. More
importantly, simply adopting existing NLP technologies, e.g., retrieving and
then cross-checking, is not a one-size-fits-all solution due to the gap between
textual similarity and idea conception. In this paper, we propose to harness
large language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated
with two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the
considerate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based
on their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To
capture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by
distilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar
conception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty
detection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the
proposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks. Codes and data are

Conclusion: POLLUX为俄语大语言模型的生成能力评估提供了高效、透明的解决方案，推动了模型评估方法的发展。

Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to
evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances
the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of
detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate
responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables
transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming,
side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained
taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code
generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100
manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized
by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset
entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B)
evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach
provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model
development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training,
and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included
tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF
classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results,
and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for
testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box)
models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured
data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge
letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF
classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from
black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.
  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone,
achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for
Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear
explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc
explanations on black-box models.
  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for
phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while
providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in
transparent clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding and generation, leading to extensive benchmarking across
diverse tasks. However, cryptanalysis a critical area for data security and
encryption has not yet been thoroughly explored in LLM evaluations. To address
this gap, we evaluate cryptanalytic potential of state of the art LLMs on
encrypted texts generated using a range of cryptographic algorithms. We
introduce a novel benchmark dataset comprising diverse plain texts spanning
various domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics paired with their
encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few shot settings, we assess multiple
LLMs for decryption accuracy and semantic comprehension across different
encryption schemes. Our findings reveal key insights into the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in side-channel communication while raising concerns about
their susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks. This research highlights the
dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing
discussion on AI safety and security.

Result: 在数学推理和幻觉基准测试中，FSPO显著减少了幻觉现象，同时提升了推理准确性。

Conclusion: FSPO是一种有效的RL微调方法，能够显著提升LLMs在推理任务中的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in reasoning tasks
through reinforcement learning (RL) optimization, achieving impressive
capabilities across various challenging benchmarks. However, our empirical
analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning
significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically
analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient,
entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key
factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose
Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL
fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each
reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to
dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual
correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical
reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models
demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing
reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.

Motivation: 现有研究普遍认为LLMs在跨语言任务中表现一致，但缺乏对文化和语言背景的综合评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分解语言媒介和文化背景两个维度，构建双评估框架，对多种模型进行广泛评估，并结合可解释性探针分析神经元激活情况。

Result: 发现文化与语言协同现象，即模型在文化与语言对齐的问题上表现更好，且神经元激活比例可作为多语言性能的潜在指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLMs在跨语言任务中表现不一致，强调了文化和语言背景评估的必要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Dual Evaluation Framework to comprehensively assess
the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. By decomposing the evaluation along the
dimensions of linguistic medium and cultural context, this framework enables a
nuanced analysis of LLMs' ability to process questions within both native and
cross-cultural contexts cross-lingually. Extensive evaluations are conducted on
a wide range of models, revealing a notable "CulturalLinguistic Synergy"
phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are
culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored
through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of
specific neurons are activated in a language's cultural context. This
activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating
multilingual performance during model training. Our findings challenge the
prevailing notion that LLMs, primarily trained on English data, perform
uniformly across languages and highlight the necessity of culturally and
linguistically model evaluations. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 劳动力市场分析依赖于从招聘广告中提取信息，但现有方法依赖计算成本高的大语言模型（LLMs），效率低下。

Method: 提出ConTeXT-match，一种基于对比学习和令牌级注意力的轻量级双编码器模型，用于技能分类的多标签任务。

Result: ConTeXT-match在技能提取效率和性能上达到最优，同时引入Skill-XL基准和JobBERT V2模型，进一步提升了分析质量。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法高效、准确且可扩展，适用于大规模实时劳动力市场分析。

Abstract: Labor market analysis relies on extracting insights from job advertisements,
which provide valuable yet unstructured information on job titles and
corresponding skill requirements. While state-of-the-art methods for skill
extraction achieve strong performance, they depend on large language models
(LLMs), which are computationally expensive and slow. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{ConTeXT-match}, a novel contrastive learning approach with token-level
attention that is well-suited for the extreme multi-label classification task
of skill classification. \textbf{ConTeXT-match} significantly improves skill
extraction efficiency and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with
a lightweight bi-encoder model. To support robust evaluation, we introduce
\textbf{Skill-XL}, a new benchmark with exhaustive, sentence-level skill
annotations that explicitly address the redundancy in the large label space.
Finally, we present \textbf{JobBERT V2}, an improved job title normalization
model that leverages extracted skills to produce high-quality job title
representations. Experiments demonstrate that our models are efficient,
accurate, and scalable, making them ideal for large-scale, real-time labor
market analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于比较次数的效率评估方法在LLM推理成本较高时失效，需要新的框架重新评估算法效率。

Method: 通过将成本模型围绕LLM推理重新设计，提出批处理和缓存等策略以减少推理成本。

Result: 研究发现，传统最优算法在LLM推理成本主导时可能效率下降。

Conclusion: 新框架强调优化LLM推理成本的重要性，为排序算法设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for analyzing sorting algorithms in pairwise
ranking prompting (PRP), re-centering the cost model around LLM inferences
rather than traditional pairwise comparisons. While classical metrics based on
comparison counts have traditionally been used to gauge efficiency, our
analysis reveals that expensive LLM inferences overturn these predictions;
accordingly, our framework encourages strategies such as batching and caching
to mitigate inference costs. We show that algorithms optimal in the classical
setting can lose efficiency when LLM inferences dominate the cost under certain
optimizations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个新框架，旨在生成可解释的政治偏见嵌入，通过提取政治话题和偏见指标，并在新闻文章中分配结构化偏见分数，显著提升了政治偏见分类的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型在捕捉意识形态细微差别方面表现不足，限制了其在需要理解政治偏见的任务中的有效性。

Method: PRISM分两阶段工作：1) 从弱标记新闻数据中提取细粒度政治话题及其偏见指标；2) 基于这些指标为新闻文章分配结构化偏见分数。

Result: PRISM在政治偏见分类任务中优于现有文本嵌入模型，并提供高度可解释的表示。

Conclusion: PRISM通过明确关联偏见揭示维度，增强了嵌入的可解释性和预测能力，适用于多样化检索和意识形态分析。

Abstract: Semantic Text Embedding is a fundamental NLP task that encodes textual
content into vector representations, where proximity in the embedding space
reflects semantic similarity. While existing embedding models excel at
capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting
their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias.
To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to
Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key
stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically
extracts fine-grained political topics and their corresponding bias indicators
from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding,
which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment
with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly
tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and
predictive power. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we
demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in
political bias classification while offering highly interpretable
representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis.

Motivation: 解决自动语音识别（ASR）在低资源语言和弱监督场景下的域适应问题，提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出多阶段域适应框架（MSDA），结合自监督学习和半监督技术，采用两阶段适应方法。

Conclusion: MSDA框架为无监督域适应提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，证明了自监督与自训练结合的必要性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation
framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage
Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation
approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised
techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of
ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is
particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly
supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised
domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a
cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，通过多个LLM的协作提升文化适应性，实验表明辩论方法优于单LLM基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要适应多样文化背景以服务全球社区，但现有方法多为单LLM单轮交互，无法充分利用多LLM的互补优势。

Method: 引入多智能体辩论框架，两种变体：纯辩论和动态选择自省与辩论。在75国的社交礼仪基准上评估7个LLM及21种组合。

Result: 辩论显著提升整体准确性和文化群体公平性，小模型（7-9B）通过辩论达到与大模型（27B）相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论是提升LLM文化适应性的有效方法，尤其对小模型表现显著。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse
cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While
previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose
to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural
adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based
agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final
decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively
debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and
debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs
(and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette
norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall
accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably,
multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies
comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

TL;DR: 论文提出TRIDENT框架，通过分析词汇多样性、恶意意图和越狱策略三个维度，评估对齐数据集的风险覆盖范围，并生成两个数据集（TRIDENT-Core和TRIDENT-Edge）。实验表明，基于TRIDENT-Edge微调的模型在降低危害分数和攻击成功率上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易生成有害内容或被恶意利用，现有安全对齐数据集风险覆盖不足，缺乏多维度分析。

Method: 提出TRIDENT框架，通过自动化管道生成多样化的有害指令及伦理对齐响应，构建两个数据集，并用于微调模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在危害分数上平均降低14.29%，攻击成功率降低20%。

Conclusion: TRIDENT框架能有效提升对齐数据集的风险覆盖范围，显著改善模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to generating harmful content or being exploited
for malicious purposes. Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced
to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets
often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily
on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically
measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential
dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We
further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based,
zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions
spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically
aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311
examples, and TRIDENT-Edge, with 18,773 examples. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1-8B on
TRIDENT-Edge demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving an average 14.29%
reduction in Harm Score, and a 20% decrease in Attack Success Rate compared to
the best-performing baseline model fine-tuned on the WildBreak dataset.

TL;DR: LinearPatch是一种简单即插即用的技术，通过Hadamard变换和通道缩放解决层剪枝后激活幅度不匹配问题，显著提升剪枝后模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法在压缩大型语言模型时会导致性能显著下降，主要原因是剪枝接口处的激活幅度不匹配。

Method: 采用Hadamard变换抑制特定令牌中的异常值，并通过通道缩放对齐激活幅度，最终融合为单一矩阵作为补丁。

Result: 在剪枝5层LLaMA-3-8B时，LinearPatch保留了原始模型94.15%的性能，优于现有方法4%。通过离线知识蒸馏可进一步提升至95.16%。

Conclusion: LinearPatch是一种高效且低开销的层剪枝后优化方法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Layer pruning has become a popular technique for compressing large language
models (LLMs) due to its simplicity. However, existing layer pruning methods
often suffer from significant performance drops. We identify that this
degradation stems from the mismatch of activation magnitudes across layers and
tokens at the pruning interface. To address this, we propose LinearPatch, a
simple plug-and-play technique to revive the layer-pruned LLMs. The proposed
method adopts Hadamard transformation to suppress massive outliers in
particular tokens, and channel-wise scaling to align the activation magnitudes.
These operations can be fused into a single matrix, which functions as a patch
to bridge the pruning interface with negligible inference overhead. LinearPatch
retains up to 94.15% performance of the original model when pruning 5 layers of
LLaMA-3-8B on the question answering benchmark, surpassing existing
state-of-the-art methods by 4%. In addition, the patch matrix can be further
optimized with memory efficient offline knowledge distillation. With only 5K
samples, the retained performance of LinearPatch can be further boosted to
95.16% within 30 minutes on a single computing card.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的广泛应用，用户需要反馈机制来负责任地使用AI，尤其是在无法评估AI预测质量的场景中。

Method: 研究在机器翻译场景中，比较了四种质量反馈机制：显式反馈（错误高亮和LLM解释）和隐式反馈（回译和问答表）。

Result: 除错误高亮外，其他反馈类型均显著提升决策准确性和依赖度；隐式反馈（尤其是问答表）在准确性、依赖度和用户体验上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式反馈（如问答表）在帮助用户评估AI翻译质量方面更有效，值得推广。

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback
mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly
in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI
predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where
monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then
with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit
feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using 1)
error highlights and 2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps
users compare MT inputs and outputs through 3) backtranslation and 4)
question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error
highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate
reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields
significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision
accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest
ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Conclusion: Soft Reasoning是一种可扩展、模型无关的解决方案，能有效提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limited
diversity and inefficient search. We propose Soft Reasoning, an embedding-based
search framework that optimises the embedding of the first token to guide
generation. It combines (1) embedding perturbation for controlled exploration
and (2) Bayesian optimisation to refine embeddings via a verifier-guided
objective, balancing exploration and exploitation. This approach improves
reasoning accuracy and coherence while avoiding reliance on heuristic search.
Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making
it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.

Motivation: 解决BPE分词器在多语言环境中的问题，如非西方脚本的惩罚和部分UTF-8序列令牌的生成，以及正则表达式预标记化的脆弱性和边缘情况。

Method: 提出SCRIPT编码方案，利用Unicode脚本和类别属性进行初始令牌化，并引入约束BPE合并策略以保持字符完整性。

Result: SCRIPT-BPE在保持竞争力的压缩率的同时，消除了非拉丁脚本语言的编码惩罚。

Conclusion: SCRIPT-BPE为多语言环境提供了一种更稳健和高效的预标记化替代方案。

Abstract: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers, widely used in Large Language Models,
face challenges in multilingual settings, including penalization of non-Western
scripts and the creation of tokens with partial UTF-8 sequences.
Pretokenization, often reliant on complex regular expressions, can also
introduce fragility and unexpected edge cases. We propose SCRIPT (Script
Category Representation in PreTokenization), a novel encoding scheme that
bypasses UTF-8 byte conversion by using initial tokens based on Unicode script
and category properties. This approach enables a simple, rule-based
pretokenization strategy that respects script boundaries, offering a robust
alternative to pretokenization strategies based on regular expressions. We also
introduce and validate a constrained BPE merging strategy that enforces
character integrity, applicable to both SCRIPT-BPE and byte-based BPE. Our
experiments demonstrate that SCRIPT-BPE achieves competitive compression while
eliminating encoding-based penalties for non-Latin-script languages.

Motivation: 解决低资源和零资源语言在语音到文本翻译中的挑战，通过音素识别增强跨语言迁移能力。

Method: 采用多语言LLM扩展处理语音和音素，结合课程学习策略逐步训练复杂任务。

Result: 在低资源条件下提升翻译质量，实现零资源翻译，但对高资源性能略有影响。

Conclusion: 音素增强的思维链框架是推动语音到文本翻译普及的有前景方向。

Abstract: We propose a Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) approach that integrates
phoneme representations into a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to improve
translation in low-resource and zero-resource settings. By introducing phoneme
recognition as an intermediate step, we enhance cross-lingual transfer,
enabling translation even for languages with no labeled speech data. Our system
builds on a multilingual LLM, which we extend to process speech and phonemes.
Training follows a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduces
more complex tasks. Experiments on multilingual S2TT benchmarks show that
phoneme-augmented CoT improves translation quality in low-resource conditions
and enables zero-resource translation, while slightly impacting high-resource
performance. Despite this trade-off, our findings demonstrate that
phoneme-based CoT is a promising step toward making S2TT more accessible across
diverse languages.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers granular insights into opinions
but often suffers from the scarcity of diverse, labeled datasets that reflect
real-world conversational nuances. This paper presents an approach for
generating synthetic ABSA data using Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
this gap. We detail the generation process aimed at producing data with
consistent topic and sentiment distributions across multiple domains using
GPT-4o. The quality and utility of the generated data were evaluated by
assessing the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) on topic and sentiment classification
tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthetic data,
revealing distinct performance trade-offs among the models: DeepSeekR1 showed
higher precision, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited strong recall,
and Gemini 1.5 Pro offered significantly faster inference. We conclude that
LLM-based synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible method for
creating valuable ABSA resources, facilitating research and model evaluation

Method: 通过专业发展课程，370名高中教师和5,370名学生合作创建了数据集，使用最小对句法表达与学科和社区相关的刻板印象。

Result: HESEIA在人口统计轴和知识领域上表现出多样性，并揭示了当前大型语言模型未识别的更多刻板印象。

Conclusion: HESEIA为基于教育社区的偏见评估提供了支持，强调了参与式方法的重要性。

Abstract: Most resources for evaluating social biases in Large Language Models are
developed without co-design from the communities affected by these biases, and
rarely involve participatory approaches. We introduce HESEIA, a dataset of
46,499 sentences created in a professional development course. The course
involved 370 high-school teachers and 5,370 students from 189 Latin-American
schools. Unlike existing benchmarks, HESEIA captures intersectional biases
across multiple demographic axes and school subjects. It reflects local
contexts through the lived experience and pedagogical expertise of educators.
Teachers used minimal pairs to create sentences that express stereotypes
relevant to their school subjects and communities. We show the dataset
diversity in term of demographic axes represented and also in terms of the
knowledge areas included. We demonstrate that the dataset contains more
stereotypes unrecognized by current LLMs than previous datasets. HESEIA is
available to support bias assessments grounded in educational communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语音转换的阿拉伯方言识别（ADI）方法，显著提升了跨域场景下的鲁棒性，并在新收集的真实测试集上取得了高达+34.1%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ADI系统在域外语音上的泛化能力较差，限制了其在包容性语音技术开发中的应用。

Method: 采用基于语音转换的方法训练ADI模型，以减少数据集中的说话者偏见并提升模型性能。

Result: 在跨四个不同领域的真实测试集上，模型表现优异，准确率最高提升34.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了ADI系统的鲁棒性，并公开了模型和数据集以支持阿拉伯语包容性语音技术的发展。

Abstract: Arabic dialect identification (ADI) systems are essential for large-scale
data collection pipelines that enable the development of inclusive speech
technologies for Arabic language varieties. However, the reliability of current
ADI systems is limited by poor generalization to out-of-domain speech. In this
paper, we present an effective approach based on voice conversion for training
ADI models that achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly
improves robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Evaluated on a newly collected
real-world test set spanning four different domains, our approach yields
consistent improvements of up to +34.1% in accuracy across domains.
Furthermore, we present an analysis of our approach and demonstrate that voice
conversion helps mitigate the speaker bias in the ADI dataset. We release our
robust ADI model and cross-domain evaluation dataset to support the development
of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域缺乏有效的多模态评估数据集，阻碍了MLLMs在该领域的发展。

Method: 构建FinMME数据集，包含多样化的金融样本，并通过20名标注者和验证机制确保质量；开发FinScore评估系统，结合幻觉惩罚和多维能力评估。

Result: FinMME具有高鲁棒性，不同提示下的预测差异低于1%；先进模型如GPT-4o在FinMME上表现不佳。

Conclusion: FinMME为金融领域的MLLMs提供了高质量评估基准，填补了现有空白，并展示了其挑战性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid development
in recent years. However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of
effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the
development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing
more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial
domains and 6 asset classes, featuring 10 major chart types and 21 subtypes. We
ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation
mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system
incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability
assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit
unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The
benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different
prompts remaining below 1%, demonstrating superior reliability compared to

TL;DR: 通过自我反思和强化学习提升大语言模型性能，实验显示在数学方程书写和函数调用任务中分别有34.7%和18.1%的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在生成合成数据不可行且仅能获得二元反馈的情况下，如何通过自我反思增强模型解决复杂任务的能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：任务失败时生成自我反思分析，随后在反思内容指导下重新尝试任务，成功则奖励反思阶段的生成内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升模型性能，尤其在较小模型（1.5B-7B参数）上表现优于更大模型。

Conclusion: 这一新范式为语言模型在有限反馈下自我提升提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We explore a method for improving the performance of large language models
through self-reflection and reinforcement learning. By incentivizing the model
to generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate
that a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even
when generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is
available. Our framework operates in two stages: first, upon failing a given
task, the model generates a self-reflective commentary analyzing its previous
attempt; second, the model is given another attempt at the task with the
self-reflection in context. If the subsequent attempt succeeds, the tokens
generated during the self-reflection phase are rewarded. Our experimental
results show substantial performance gains across a variety of model
architectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1%
improvement at function calling. Notably, smaller fine-tuned models (1.5
billion to 7 billion parameters) outperform models in the same family that are
10 times larger. Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful
and reliable language models that can self-improve on challenging tasks with
limited external feedback.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估语言模型性能的方法——电路稳定性，通过分析模型在不同输入下的一致性推理能力，为模型的泛化性和可解释性提供了新的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的快速发展，传统基准测试容易饱和，而创建更具挑战性的数据集又耗时费力。因此，需要一种新的评估方法来更有效地衡量模型性能。

Method: 论文提出了电路稳定性的概念，并对其进行了数学形式化。通过三个案例研究，实证分析了电路稳定性与模型泛化能力的关系。

Result: 研究发现，电路稳定性能够表征和预测模型的不同泛化能力，为模型的性能评估提供了新的维度。

Conclusion: 电路稳定性方法为模型的泛化性与可解释性之间的关联提供了严谨的研究方向。

Abstract: Extensively evaluating the capabilities of (large) language models is
difficult. Rapid development of state-of-the-art models induce benchmark
saturation, while creating more challenging datasets is labor-intensive.
Inspired by the recent developments in mechanistic interpretability, we
introduce circuit stability as a new way to assess model performance. Circuit
stability refers to a model's ability to apply a consistent reasoning
process-its circuit-across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit
stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we
empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize
and predict different aspects of generalization. Our proposed methods offer a
step towards rigorously relating the generality of models to their
interpretability.

TL;DR: GSTransform是一种基于引导空间变换的新型指令跟随文本嵌入框架，通过轻量级变换机制动态调整预计算嵌入，显著提升效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每个新指令重新编码整个语料库，计算开销大，GSTransform旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预计算嵌入中固有的指令相关信息，通过轻量级变换机制实时调整嵌入以适应用户指令。

Result: 在三个指令感知下游任务和九个真实数据集上，GSTransform在质量和实时处理速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSTransform显著提升了指令跟随文本嵌入的效率与性能，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following
text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user
instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent
advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational
overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new
instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel
instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space
Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is
inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of
repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a
lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in
real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text
data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive
experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine
real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves
instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods
while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on
large-scale datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长，SLR的摘要筛选阶段需要高效方法。现有方法存在局限性，如二元分类或错误传播问题。

Method: 提出LGAR，结合LLM的评分器和密集重排序器，零样本评估SLR的纳入和排除标准。

Result: LGAR在平均精度上优于现有QA方法5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: LGAR为SLR摘要筛选提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of
the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and
evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate
papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date,
abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary
classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking
approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to
evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks
do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as
research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling
principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a
zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance
scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR
outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision.
Our code and data is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统分析了数据集多样性对大型语言模型（LLM）监督微调（SFT）的重要性，并提出了一种新的分类方法，涵盖宏观、中观和微观层面的多样性控制策略。实验表明，微观层面的响应多样性策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据集多样性在LLM训练中的重要性日益受到认可，但系统性分析仍不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种多样性控制策略的分类方法，涵盖宏观（指令语义）、中观（指令单元）和微观（响应中的词元分布）层面，并通过实验评估了六种策略。

Result: 宏观和中观策略在多样性增加时表现更好，而微观策略在响应中表现出更强的多样性与性能相关性，并在最大多样性时表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建高性能SFT数据集提供了实用建议，强调微观多样性策略的重要性。

Abstract: Dataset diversity plays a pivotal role for the successful training of many
machine learning models, particularly in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage
of large language model (LLM) development. Despite increasing recognition of
its importance, systematic analyses of dataset diversity still remain
underexplored. To address this gap, this work presents a systematic taxonomy of
existing diversity-control strategies, which primarily focus on the instruction
component, operating at either macroscopic (entire instruction semantics) or
mesoscopic levels (instruction units), and furthermore introduces a novel
analysis of microscopic diversity within the response component, specifically
analyzing the statistical distribution of tokens in SFT training samples. In
the experimental evaluation, we construct fixed-size datasets (e.g., 10,000
samples each) from a corpus of 117,000 open-source SFT samples, incorporating
six distinct diversity-control strategies spanning macro-, meso-, and
microscopic levels applied to both instructions and responses. We then
fine-tune LLMs on these datasets to assess the six diversity-control
strategies. Results reveal that while macroscopic and mesoscopic strategies
lead to higher performance with increasing diversity, the microscopic strategy
in responses exhibits both a stronger correlation between model performance and
the degree of diversity and superior performance with maximum diversity across
all strategies. These findings offer actionable insights for constructing
high-performance SFT datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）使用认知标记（如“相当自信”）表达自信的可靠性，发现其在同分布数据中表现稳定，但在分布外数据中不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在高风险领域应用增多，准确评估其自信度至关重要，但认知标记是否能真实反映模型内在自信尚不明确。

Method: 定义了标记自信度（模型使用认知标记时的观察准确率），并在开源和专有LLMs的多问答数据集上评估其稳定性。

Result: 认知标记在同分布数据中表现良好，但在分布外数据中自信度不一致。

Conclusion: 认知标记用于自信度估计的可靠性存在问题，需改进标记自信度与实际模型不确定性的对齐。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express
confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") instead of
numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use
these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of
quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap,
we first define marker confidence as the observed accuracy when a model employs
an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple
question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while
markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is
inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant
concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation,
underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence
and actual model uncertainty. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在单周期预训练中不使用dropout可以提升下游任务性能，且模型编辑性更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨dropout在大型语言模型（LLM）单周期预训练中的作用，填补缺乏实证研究的空白。

Method: 通过实验比较不同dropout水平在BERT和Pythia模型单周期预训练中的效果，评估下游任务表现和模型编辑性。

Result: 不使用dropout时，下游任务（如语言建模、问答等）表现更优，且模型编辑性更好。

Conclusion: 建议在单周期预训练中不使用dropout。

Abstract: Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that
reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep
learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to
modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for
large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on
the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch
pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs
with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language
modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and
natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during
pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout"
also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further
investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without
dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and
equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate
to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自动故事生成中表现出潜力，但在保持长篇连贯性和提供用户直观有效控制方面仍存在挑战。检索增强生成（RAG）虽能减少幻觉，但结构化数据在生成式故事叙述中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种知识图谱辅助的故事生成流程，并通过15名参与者的用户研究评估其有效性。参与者创建故事提示、生成故事并编辑知识图谱以塑造叙事。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明，知识图谱显著提高了动作导向和结构化叙事的故事质量。此外，编辑知识图谱增强了用户的控制感，使故事生成更具互动性和趣味性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱在提升LLM故事生成质量和用户控制方面具有显著效果，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated story
generation, but challenges remain in maintaining long-form coherence and
providing users with intuitive and effective control. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has proven effective in reducing hallucinations in text
generation; however, the use of structured data to support generative
storytelling remains underexplored. This paper investigates how knowledge
graphs (KGs) can enhance LLM-based storytelling by improving narrative quality
and enabling user-driven modifications. We propose a KG-assisted storytelling
pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 15
participants. Participants created their own story prompts, generated stories,
and edited knowledge graphs to shape their narratives. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, our findings demonstrate that knowledge graphs
significantly enhance story quality in action-oriented and structured
narratives within our system settings. Additionally, editing the knowledge
graph increases users' sense of control, making storytelling more engaging,
interactive, and playful.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估法律文本质量的方法，重点关注清晰度、连贯性和术语，并分析了49个大型语言模型（LLM），发现模型质量在140亿参数后趋于稳定，推理模型表现优于基础架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前法律应用中LLM的评估主要关注事实准确性，而忽视了语言质量（如清晰度、连贯性和术语），因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 开发回归模型评估法律文本质量；2. 创建专门的法律问题集；3. 使用该框架分析49个LLM。

Result: 1. 模型质量在140亿参数后趋于稳定；2. 量化和上下文长度等工程选择影响较小；3. 推理模型表现优于基础架构。Qwen3系列在性价比上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为法律LLM建立了标准化评估协议，还揭示了当前训练数据优化方法的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications,
current evaluation benchmarks tend to focus mainly on factual accuracy while
largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity,
coherence, and terminology. To address this gap, we propose three steps: First,
we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on
clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of
legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.
  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off
at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at
72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and
context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical
significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently
outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the
release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series
as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only
establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers
fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches. Code

Result: 在事实准确性和可解释性上显著提升，整体回答改进40%，幻觉检测率达50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM在临床应用中提供了更可信和透明的解决方案，是迈向可靠AI辅助医疗的关键一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are
prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to
their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as
Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding
answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level
explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking
framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used
in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated
responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is
independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical
guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct
tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and
explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader
assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated
significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework
achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination
detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant
chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the
generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.
This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable
clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical
application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型研究中难以区分记忆与泛化的问题。

Method: 将记忆分为‘无意记忆’和‘泛化’，通过消除泛化计算总记忆量，估计模型容量。训练不同规模的模型并观察记忆与泛化的关系。

Result: GPT类模型的容量约为3.6比特/参数；模型在容量填满后开始‘顿悟’，无意记忆减少，泛化能力增强。

Conclusion: 提出了模型容量与数据规模的缩放规律，为语言模型研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a
datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior
studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle
memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two
components: \textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains
about a specific dataset, and \textit{generalization}, the information a model
contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate
generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an
estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models
have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language
models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until
their capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended
memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of
transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and
produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to
membership inference.

Motivation: 挑战多语言训练对跨语言迁移的普遍假设，探讨其在语义任务中的实际效果。

Method: 通过28种语言的大规模分析，研究多语言训练对多义性消歧和词汇语义变化任务的影响。

Result: 多语言训练并非必要，其优势主要由数据组成和评估方法等混杂因素解释。

Conclusion: 呼吁更严谨的多语言NLP评估，并发布模型和基准以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer allows models to perform tasks in languages unseen
during training and is often assumed to benefit from increased multilinguality.
In this work, we challenge this assumption in the context of two underexplored,
sense-aware tasks: polysemy disambiguation and lexical semantic change. Through
a large-scale analysis across 28 languages, we show that multilingual training
is neither necessary nor inherently beneficial for effective transfer. Instead,
we find that confounding factors - such as fine-tuning data composition and
evaluation artifacts - better account for the perceived advantages of
multilinguality. Our findings call for more rigorous evaluations in
multilingual NLP. We release fine-tuned models and benchmarks to support
further research, with implications extending to low-resource and typologically
diverse languages.

Conclusion: MetaFaith是一种有效的LLMs置信度校准方法，能显著改善不确定性表达的忠实性，填补了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty
communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false
claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first
systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs,
benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that
$\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a
comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing
interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only
marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even
harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human
metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration
across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in
faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged
by humans.

TL;DR: AlphaOne（α1）是一个通用框架，用于在测试时调节大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理进度。它通过引入α时刻和动态调度慢思考转换，统一并推广了现有的单调缩放方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在推理过程中缺乏灵活性和效率，AlphaOne旨在通过动态调节慢思考与快思考的转换来解决这一问题。

Method: AlphaOne引入α时刻，通过伯努利随机过程动态调度慢思考转换，并在α时刻后确定性地终止慢思考，以促进快速推理和高效答案生成。

Result: 在数学、编码和科学领域的多个挑战性基准测试中，Alpha1表现出卓越的推理能力和效率。

Conclusion: Alpha1通过灵活的慢到快推理调节，显著提升了大型推理模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: This paper presents AlphaOne ($\alpha$1), a universal framework for
modulating reasoning progress in large reasoning models (LRMs) at test time.
$\alpha$1 first introduces $\alpha$ moment, which represents the scaled
thinking phase with a universal parameter $\alpha$. Within this scaled
pre-$\alpha$ moment phase, it dynamically schedules slow thinking transitions
by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli
stochastic process. After the $\alpha$ moment, $\alpha$1 deterministically
terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast
reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and
generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense
slow-to-fast reasoning modulation. Extensive empirical studies on various
challenging benchmarks across mathematical, coding, and scientific domains
demonstrate $\alpha$1's superior reasoning capability and efficiency. Project

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ProRL的新训练方法，通过KL散度控制、参考策略重置和多任务训练，证明长期RL训练能发现基础模型无法触及的新推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨强化学习（RL）是否能真正扩展语言模型的推理能力，还是仅放大基础模型中已有的高奖励输出，并验证RL计算规模是否可靠提升推理性能。

Method: 引入ProRL方法，结合KL散度控制、参考策略重置和多任务训练，进行长期RL训练。

Result: RL训练模型在广泛任务中优于基础模型，甚至在基础模型完全失败的任务中表现优异，推理能力提升与基础模型任务能力和训练时长相关。

Conclusion: RL能探索并填充新的解决方案空间，为未来长期RL推理研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted
reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with
verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a
model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already
latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL
compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we
challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)
training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base
models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training
methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy
resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that
RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of
pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely
regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary
improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and
training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of
solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions
under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and
establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We
release model weights to support further research:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于推理大语言模型（LLMs）的代码生成方法CPro1，用于解决组合设计领域中的开放性问题，成功解决了多个长期未解的实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合设计领域存在许多开放性问题，传统方法难以解决。利用推理LLMs的迭代生成和优化能力，可以更高效地构造解决方案。

Method: CPro1结合推理LLMs，通过文本定义和验证器生成搜索启发式方法，自动调整超参数并提供执行反馈，以解决组合设计问题。

Result: CPro1成功解决了16个组合设计问题中的7个长期开放实例，包括3个新解决的实例，并在2025年文献中解决了更多问题。

Conclusion: 推理LLMs在组合设计问题中表现出色，CPro1方法为解决开放性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning are trained to iteratively
generate and refine their answers before finalizing them, which can help with
applications to mathematics and code generation. We apply code generation with
reasoning LLMs to a specific task in the mathematical field of combinatorial
design. This field studies diverse types of combinatorial designs, many of
which have lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been
determined. The Constructive Protocol CPro1 uses LLMs to generate search
heuristics that have the potential to construct solutions to small open
instances. Starting with a textual definition and a validity verifier for a
particular type of design, CPro1 guides LLMs to select and implement
strategies, while providing automated hyperparameter tuning and execution
feedback. CPro1 with reasoning LLMs successfully solves long-standing open
instances for 7 of 16 combinatorial design problems selected from the 2006
Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, including new solved instances for 3 of
these (Bhaskar Rao Designs, Symmetric Weighing Matrices, Balanced Ternary
Designs) that were unsolved by CPro1 with non-reasoning LLMs. It also solves
open instances for several problems from recent (2025) literature, generating
new Covering Sequences, Johnson Clique Covers, Deletion Codes, and a Uniform
Nested Steiner Quadruple System.

Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的多智能体系统在跨领域任务中需要完全重新设计和训练的局限性。

Method: 采用模块化架构，包括领域无关的Planner、协调器Coordinator和领域特定的Workers，并引入OWL优化训练方法。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中表现优异，达到69.70%的准确率，优于商业系统，且32B模型性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Workforce为下一代通用AI助手提供了可扩展的跨领域解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for
automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to
their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical
shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining
of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from
specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a
domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask
management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling
capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both
inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to
new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce
Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across
domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning
from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on
the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source
state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like
OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model
achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to
GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization
and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next
generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

Method: 设计了课程征集-存储-选择机制，让LLM团队在协作过程中互相学习成功与失败经验。

Result: 实验表明，采用课程协作的小模型团队性能优于单个大模型和其他多LLM协作方法。

Conclusion: 通过共享“课程”实现LLM团队协作是有效的，能够在不依赖先验知识的情况下提升任务表现。

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in
different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in
several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code
LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others.
This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents
to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a
priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes
and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the
knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective
solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the
lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team
of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other
multi-LLM collaboration methods.

Abstract: As multimodal large models (MLLMs) continue to advance across challenging
tasks, a key question emerges: What essential capabilities are still missing? A
critical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the
environment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal
understanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence,
models must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In
particular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond
coherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial
exploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn
multimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration,
we particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert
annotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack
such complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at
both global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k
prompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled
preference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal
understanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages
tool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this
goal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting
judges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of
\InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the
multi-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can
help facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step.

Method: 引入MSQA基准测试，包含详细解释和二元判断两种问题格式，测试10种先进LLMs的性能。

Result: 专有API LLMs最高准确率达84.5%，开源LLMs约60.5%，领域特定LLMs表现较差。

Conclusion: MSQA是首个同时评估LLMs在材料科学中事实知识和推理能力的基准测试，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for materials
science, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their domain-specific
knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MSQA, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark of 1,757 graduate-level materials
science questions in two formats: detailed explanatory responses and binary
True/False assessments. MSQA distinctively challenges LLMs by requiring both
precise factual knowledge and multi-step reasoning across seven materials
science sub-fields, such as structure-property relationships, synthesis
processes, and computational modeling. Through experiments with 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, we identify significant gaps in current LLM performance.
While API-based proprietary LLMs achieve up to 84.5% accuracy, open-source
(OSS) LLMs peak around 60.5%, and domain-specific LLMs often underperform
significantly due to overfitting and distributional shifts. MSQA represents the
first benchmark to jointly evaluate the factual and reasoning capabilities of
LLMs crucial for LLMs in advanced materials science.

Method: Multi-RAG通过多模态信息理解和推理，整合视频、音频和文本等多源信息流，并在MMBench-Video数据集上进行了评估。

Result: Multi-RAG在性能上优于现有的开源视频大语言模型和大型视觉语言模型，同时资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: Multi-RAG展示了其作为未来动态人机协作系统高效实用基础的潜力。

Abstract: To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter
information, and make informed decisions in ever-changing situations is
critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human
life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden
on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich
scenarios.
  To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal
retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance
to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve
situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and
reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and
text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG
explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for
adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate
its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked
Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video
understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to
existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input
data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and
efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in
dynamic, real-world contexts.

Motivation: 现代知识库常包含实体描述和类型，这些信息可为推断缺失事实提供有价值背景。利用大语言模型从文本描述中提取事实并识别知识图谱模式的能力，提出了一种端到端的实例补全方法。

Method: 提出GenIC框架，分为属性预测（多标签分类任务）和链接预测（生成式序列到序列任务）两步。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: GenIC框架通过结合属性预测和链接预测，有效提升了知识图谱实例补全的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion aims to address the gaps of knowledge bases by
adding new triples that represent facts. The complexity of this task depends on
how many parts of a triple are already known. Instance completion involves
predicting the relation-tail pair when only the head is given (h, ?, ?).
Notably, modern knowledge bases often contain entity descriptions and types,
which can provide valuable context for inferring missing facts. By leveraging
these textual descriptions and the ability of large language models to extract
facts from them and recognize patterns within the knowledge graph schema, we
propose an LLM-powered, end-to-end instance completion approach. Specifically,
we introduce GenIC: a two-step Generative Instance Completion framework. The
first step focuses on property prediction, treated as a multi-label
classification task. The second step is link prediction, framed as a generative
sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results on three datasets show that our
method outperforms existing baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SEFT为稀疏大语言模型的微调提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks but face deployment challenges due to their massive computational
demands. While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can
effectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance
at high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing
fine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve
sparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for
sparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a
novel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves
the sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the
overall sparsity throughout the process. The strengths of SEFT lie in its
ability to perform task-specific adaptation through a weight drop-and-grow
strategy, enabling the pruned model to self-adapt its sparse connectivity
pattern based on the target dataset. Furthermore, a sensitivity-driven pruning
criterion is employed to ensure that the desired sparsity level is consistently
maintained throughout fine-tuning. Our experiments on various LLMs, including
LLaMA families, DeepSeek, and Mistral, across a diverse set of benchmarks
demonstrate that SEFT achieves stronger performance while offering superior
memory and time efficiency compared to existing baselines. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/QiaoXiao7282/SEFT.

Motivation: LVLM在动态现实应用中受限于静态训练数据、易产生幻觉且无法验证最新外部证据，RAG提供了一种通过检索机制访问大规模知识库的解决方案。

Method: 系统分析了多模态RAG的三个阶段：检索阶段（模态配置和检索策略）、重排序阶段（减少位置偏差和提升证据相关性）、生成阶段（整合检索结果），并提出了一种统一的代理框架。

Result: 通过RAG流程的全面探索，LVLM性能平均提升了5%，且无需微调。

Conclusion: RAG为LVLM提供了动态访问外部知识的能力，显著提升了其在现实应用中的表现，未来可进一步优化代理框架。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and
complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data,
susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against
up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic
real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a
practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access
large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding
model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this
paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG
pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the
modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on
strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved
evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best
integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we
extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and
generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence
and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG
for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance
boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Chain of Thought (CoT) 方法依赖中间推理步骤，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。递归推理方法虽有效，但需要昂贵的预训练且缺乏理论框架。

Method: 提出 Flow CoT 和 SCOUT 框架，利用渐进蒸馏和跨注意力模块实现递归推理，无需预训练。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，SCOUT 将准确性和解释质量提升高达 1.8%。定性分析显示其能逐步深化推理。

Conclusion: SCOUT 和 Flow CoT 是增强 LLM 推理能力的可行且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting improves the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by encouraging step by step thinking. However, CoT-based
methods depend on intermediate reasoning steps, which limits scalability and
generalization. Recent work explores recursive reasoning, where LLMs reuse
internal layers across iterations to refine latent representations without
explicit CoT supervision. While promising, these approaches often require
costly pretraining and lack a principled framework for how reasoning should
evolve across iterations. We address this gap by introducing Flow Chain of
Thought (Flow CoT), a reasoning paradigm that models recursive inference as a
progressive trajectory of latent cognitive states. Flow CoT frames each
iteration as a distinct cognitive stage deepening reasoning across iterations
without relying on manual supervision. To realize this, we propose SCOUT
(Stepwise Cognitive Optimization Using Teachers), a lightweight fine tuning
framework that enables Flow CoT style reasoning without the need for
pretraining. SCOUT uses progressive distillation to align each iteration with a
teacher of appropriate capacity, and a cross attention based retrospective
module that integrates outputs from previous iterations while preserving the
models original computation flow. Experiments across eight reasoning benchmarks
show that SCOUT consistently improves both accuracy and explanation quality,
achieving up to 1.8% gains under fine tuning. Qualitative analyses further
reveal that SCOUT enables progressively deeper reasoning across iterations
refining both belief formation and explanation granularity. These results not
only validate the effectiveness of SCOUT, but also demonstrate the practical
viability of Flow CoT as a scalable framework for enhancing reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，学习API功能仍具挑战性，但明确函数调用和自然语言批评能显著提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了文档无关的API学习的关键挑战，为未来自改进代理的开发提供了方向。

Abstract: Digital tool-based agents that invoke external Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) often rely on documentation to understand API functionality.
However, such documentation is frequently missing, outdated, privatized, or
inconsistent-hindering the development of reliable, general-purpose agents. In
this work, we propose learning API functionality directly from demonstrations
as a new paradigm applicable in scenarios without documentation. Using existing
API benchmarks, we collect demonstrations from both expert API-based agents and
from self-exploration. To understand what information demonstrations must
convey for successful task completion, we extensively study how the number of
demonstrations and the use of LLM-generated summaries and evaluations affect
the task success rate of the API-based agent. Our experiments across 3 datasets
and 5 models show that learning functionality from demonstrations remains a
non-trivial challenge, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. We find that providing
explicit function calls and natural language critiques significantly improves
the agent's task success rate due to more accurate parameter filling. We
analyze failure modes, identify sources of error, and highlight key open
challenges for future work in documentation-free, self-improving, API-based
agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多智能体系统（MAS）的系统级异常检测框架，结合结构建模与运行时行为监控，以解决现有防护机制的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的多智能体系统面临多方面的安全与可靠性风险，现有防护机制仅能提供部分保护，无法应对系统性或多点故障。

Method: 1. 基于图的框架建模智能体交互为动态执行图，支持节点、边和路径级别的语义异常检测；2. 引入可插拔的SentinelAgent（基于LLM的监督智能体），根据安全策略和上下文推理进行观察、分析和干预。

Result: 通过案例研究（如电子邮件助手和Magentic-One系统）验证了框架的有效性，能够检测隐蔽风险并提供可解释的根因分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更可信、可监控和安全的基于智能体的AI生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS)
introduces new security and reliability challenges. While these systems show
great promise in decomposing and coordinating complex tasks, they also face
multi-faceted risks across prompt manipulation, unsafe tool usage, and emergent
agent miscoordination. Existing guardrail mechanisms offer only partial
protection, primarily at the input-output level, and fall short in addressing
systemic or multi-point failures in MAS. In this work, we present a
system-level anomaly detection framework tailored for MAS, integrating
structural modeling with runtime behavioral oversight. Our approach consists of
two components. First, we propose a graph-based framework that models agent
interactions as dynamic execution graphs, enabling semantic anomaly detection
at node, edge, and path levels. Second, we introduce a pluggable SentinelAgent,
an LLM-powered oversight agent that observes, analyzes, and intervenes in MAS
execution based on security policies and contextual reasoning. By bridging
abstract detection logic with actionable enforcement, our method detects not
only single-point faults and prompt injections but also multi-agent collusion
and latent exploit paths. We validate our framework through two case studies,
including an email assistant and Microsoft's Magentic-One system, demonstrating
its ability to detect covert risks and provide explainable root-cause
attribution. Our work lays the foundation for more trustworthy, monitorable,
and secure agent-based AI ecosystems.

### [176] [Bootstrapping LLM Robustness for VLM Safety via Reducing the Pretraining Modality Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24208)
*Wenhan Yang,Spencer Stice,Ali Payani,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）的安全性与模态间隙高度负相关，提出一种预训练正则化方法，显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成安全输出方面表现较差，尤其是与纯文本模型相比，模态间隙被认为是主要原因之一。

Method: 通过分析模态间隙与安全性的关系，提出一种预训练正则化方法以减少模态间隙。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LLaVA v1.5、ShareGPT4V和MiniGPT-4上显著降低不安全率（最高16.3%），且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 减少模态间隙是提升VLMs安全性的有效方法，并可进一步增强现有防御措施。

Abstract: Ensuring Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate safe outputs is crucial for
their reliable deployment. However, LVLMs suffer from drastic safety
degradation compared to their LLM backbone. Even blank or irrelevant images can
trigger LVLMs to generate harmful responses to prompts that would otherwise be
refused in text-only contexts. The modality gap between image and text
representations has been recently hypothesized to contribute to safety
degradation of LVLMs. However, if and how the amount of modality gap affects
LVLMs' safety is not studied. In this work, we show that the amount of modality
gap is highly inversely correlated with VLMs' safety. Then, we show that this
modality gap is introduced during pretraining LVLMs and persists through
fine-tuning. Inspired by this observation, we propose a regularization to
reduce the modality gap during pretraining. Our extensive experiments on LLaVA
v1.5, ShareGPT4V, and MiniGPT-4 show that our method substantially improves
safety alignment of LVLMs, reducing unsafe rate by up to 16.3% without
compromising performance, and can further boost existing defenses by up to
18.2%.

TL;DR: E^2GraphRAG提出了一种高效的图检索增强生成框架，通过总结树和实体图的双向索引提升检索效率与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图检索方法（如GraphRAG）效率低下且依赖预定义查询模式，限制了实际应用。

Method: 在索引阶段构建总结树和实体图，并建立双向索引；检索阶段采用自适应策略选择局部或全局模式。

Result: 实验显示E^2GraphRAG索引速度比GraphRAG快10倍，检索速度比LightRAG快100倍，且保持问答性能。

Conclusion: E^2GraphRAG在效率和效果上均优于现有方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global
understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs.
However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined
query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a
streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and
Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree
with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document
chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to
capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both
local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive
retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select
between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up
to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG
in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.

Abstract: We propose ProofNet++, a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances automated

correctness, and formal verifiability over prior models. We provide theoretical
analysis of the convergence and stability of the verifier-guided RL framework
and release our datasets and codebase for future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FABLE是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）数据流推理能力的基准测试，涵盖8种数据流分析任务，在3个实际领域中测试了3类LLM。结果显示，推理模型表现最佳但速度慢，其他模型接近随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言和编程任务中表现优异，但其数据流推理能力尚未被系统评估。FABLE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FABLE基于8种软件工程中的数据流分析任务，构建了2,400个问题-答案对，测试了3类LLM（推理模型、通用模型和代码专用模型）。

Result: 推理模型准确率最高但推理速度慢20倍，其他模型表现接近随机水平。

Conclusion: FABLE为系统评估数据流推理提供了首个诊断基准，并为开发具备更强程序理解能力的模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Understanding how data moves, transforms, and persists, known as data flow,
is fundamental to reasoning in procedural tasks. Despite their fluency in
natural and programming languages, large language models (LLMs), although
increasingly being applied to decisions with procedural tasks, have not been
systematically evaluated for their ability to perform data-flow reasoning. We
introduce FABLE, an extensible benchmark designed to assess LLMs' understanding
of data flow using structured, procedural text. FABLE adapts eight classical
data-flow analyses from software engineering: reaching definitions, very busy
expressions, available expressions, live variable analysis, interval analysis,
type-state analysis, taint analysis, and concurrency analysis. These analyses
are instantiated across three real-world domains: cooking recipes, travel
routes, and automated plans. The benchmark includes 2,400 question-answer
pairs, with 100 examples for each domain-analysis combination. We evaluate
three types of LLMs: a reasoning-focused model (DeepSeek-R1 8B), a
general-purpose model (LLaMA 3.1 8B), and a code-specific model (Granite Code
8B). Each model is tested using majority voting over five sampled completions
per prompt. Results show that the reasoning model achieves higher accuracy, but
at the cost of over 20 times slower inference compared to the other models. In
contrast, the general-purpose and code-specific models perform close to random
chance. FABLE provides the first diagnostic benchmark to systematically
evaluate data-flow reasoning and offers insights for developing models with
stronger procedural understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式AI方法通常采用端到端流程，缺乏对人类设计工作流的整合，忽视了设计的迭代性。

Method: 框架将设计过程分为三个阶段（道路网络与土地利用规划、建筑布局规划、详细规划与渲染），每个阶段通过多模态扩散模型生成初步设计，供人类设计师审查与优化。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多模态扩散模型和逐步生成在保持人类控制和促进迭代优化中的优势，为城巿设计中的人机交互奠定了基础。

Abstract: Urban design is a multifaceted process that demands careful consideration of
site-specific constraints and collaboration among diverse professionals and
stakeholders. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers
transformative potential by improving the efficiency of design generation and
facilitating the communication of design ideas. However, most existing
approaches are not well integrated with human design workflows. They often
follow end-to-end pipelines with limited control, overlooking the iterative
nature of real-world design. This study proposes a stepwise generative urban
design framework that integrates multimodal diffusion models with human
expertise to enable more adaptive and controllable design processes. Instead of
generating design outcomes in a single end-to-end process, the framework
divides the process into three key stages aligned with established urban design
workflows: (1) road network and land use planning, (2) building layout
planning, and (3) detailed planning and rendering. At each stage, multimodal
diffusion models generate preliminary designs based on textual prompts and
image-based constraints, which can then be reviewed and refined by human
designers. We design an evaluation framework to assess the fidelity,
compliance, and diversity of the generated designs. Experiments using data from
Chicago and New York City demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline
models and end-to-end approaches across all three dimensions. This study
underscores the benefits of multimodal diffusion models and stepwise generation
in preserving human control and facilitating iterative refinements, laying the
groundwork for human-AI interaction in urban design solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）对大型语言模型（LLM）推理能力的影响，重点探讨了回溯在推理中的作用及其优化使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL能内化搜索策略并支持长链思维（CoT）推理，但回溯的具体贡献和最佳使用方式尚不明确。

Method: 在八项推理任务上系统研究SFT和RL的动态关系，并通过合成数据集控制回溯步骤数量，分析其影响。

Result: 发现长CoT和回溯能提升RL训练效果，且任务难度越高，回溯需求越大；RL更关注结构模式而非内容正确性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计优化LLM推理训练策略提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively
improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical
problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised
finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that
RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability.
However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly
it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use,
remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the
dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc
1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self
Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a
warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start
RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly
difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets
varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct
controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness
(content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer
CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2)
more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers
of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through
experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the
correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural
patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical
insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale
reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型缺乏显式机制来定位和利用对话中的引用文本，限制了其在引用感知对话中的应用。

Method: 论文将对话分解为历史、引用跨度和意图话语，提出了一种引用中心的数据管道，并设计了QuAda方法，通过动态调整注意力权重来处理引用文本。

Result: 实验表明，QuAda适用于多种场景，并能泛化到未见主题，提供了一种高效、即插即用的解决方案。

Conclusion: QuAda为引用感知对话提供了一种轻量级且有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Human-AI conversation frequently relies on quoting earlier text-"check it
with the formula I just highlighted"-yet today's large language models (LLMs)
lack an explicit mechanism for locating and exploiting such spans. We formalise
the challenge as span-conditioned generation, decomposing each turn into the
dialogue history, a set of token-offset quotation spans, and an intent
utterance. Building on this abstraction, we introduce a quotation-centric data
pipeline that automatically synthesises task-specific dialogues, verifies
answer correctness through multi-stage consistency checks, and yields both a
heterogeneous training corpus and the first benchmark covering five
representative scenarios. To meet the benchmark's zero-overhead and
parameter-efficiency requirements, we propose QuAda, a lightweight
training-based method that attaches two bottleneck projections to every
attention head, dynamically amplifying or suppressing attention to quoted spans
at inference time while leaving the prompt unchanged and updating < 2.8% of
backbone weights. Experiments across models show that QuAda is suitable for all
scenarios and generalises to unseen topics, offering an effective,
plug-and-play solution for quotation-aware dialogue.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential in planning and reasoning tasks, offering a flexible alternative to
classical pathfinding algorithms. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs'
independent reasoning capabilities and overlook the potential synergy between
LLMs and traditional algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark GridRoute to assess how LLMs can take advantage of
traditional algorithms. We also propose a novel hybrid prompting technique
called Algorithm of Thought (AoT), which introduces traditional algorithms'
guidance into prompting. Our benchmark evaluates six LLMs ranging from 7B to
72B parameters across various map sizes, assessing their performance in
correctness, optimality, and efficiency in grid environments with varying
sizes. Our results show that AoT significantly boosts performance across all
model sizes, particularly in larger or more complex environments, suggesting a
promising approach to addressing path planning challenges. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/LinChance/GridRoute.

Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, understanding, distinguishing,

knowledge processing and research. In this paper, we examine and analyze the
understanding and characteristics of negation in various fields such as
philosophy, logic, and linguistics etc. Based on the distinction between the
concepts of contradiction and opposition, we propose that there are three
different types of negation in knowledge from a conceptual perspective:
contradictory negation, opposite negation, and intermediary negation. To
establish a mathematical foundation that fully reflects the intrinsic
connections, properties, and laws of these different forms of negation, we
introduce SCOI: sets with contradictory negation, opposite negation and
intermediary negation, and LCOI: logic with contradictory negation, opposite
negation and intermediary negation, and we proved the main operational
properties of SCOI as well as the formal inference relations in LCOI.

Abstract: Over the last thirty years, considerable progress has been made with the
development of systems that can drive cars, play games, predict protein folding
and generate natural language. These systems are described as intelligent and
there has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial
intelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding
of intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for
building systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour. There is no commonly
agreed definition of the intelligence that AI systems are said to possess.
No-one has developed a practical measure that would enable us to compare the
intelligence of humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.
  This paper sets out a new universal measure of intelligence that is based on
the hypothesis that prediction is the most important component of intelligence.
As an agent interacts with its normal environment, the accuracy of its
predictions is summed up and the complexity of its predictions and perceived
environment is accounted for using Kolmogorov complexity. Two experiments were
carried out to evaluate the practical feasibility of the algorithm. These
demonstrated that it could measure the intelligence of an agent embodied in a
virtual maze and an agent that makes predictions about time-series data. This
universal measure could be the starting point for a new comparative science of
intelligence that ranks humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.

Conclusion: RMoA通过残差学习和动态机制，有效提升了多智能体系统的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Although multi-agent systems based on large language models show strong
capabilities on multiple tasks, they are still limited by high computational
overhead, information loss, and robustness. Inspired by ResNet's residual
learning, we propose Residual Mixture-of-Agents (RMoA), integrating residual
connections to optimize efficiency and reliability. To maximize information
utilization from model responses while minimizing computational costs, we
innovatively design an embedding-based diversity selection mechanism that
greedily selects responses via vector similarity. Furthermore, to mitigate
iterative information degradation, we introduce a Residual Extraction Agent to
preserve cross-layer incremental information by capturing inter-layer response
differences, coupled with a Residual Aggregation Agent for hierarchical
information integration. Additionally, we propose an adaptive termination
mechanism that dynamically halts processing based on residual convergence,
further improving inference efficiency. RMoA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the benchmarks of across alignment, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and multitasking understanding, while significantly reducing
computational overhead. Code is available at

Conclusion: 未来进展不仅依赖架构创新，还需更清晰的优化和评估框架。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) results
in complex systems with numerous hyperparameters that directly affect
performance. While such systems are increasingly common in retrieval-augmented
generation, the role of systematic hyperparameter optimization remains
underexplored. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of Cognee, a
modular framework for end-to-end KG construction and retrieval. Using three
multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotPotQA, TwoWikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue) we optimize
parameters related to chunking, graph construction, retrieval, and prompting.
Each configuration is scored using established metrics (exact match, F1, and
DeepEval's LLM-based correctness metric). Our results demonstrate that
meaningful gains can be achieved through targeted tuning. While the gains are
consistent, they are not uniform, with performance varying across datasets and
metrics. This variability highlights both the value of tuning and the
limitations of standard evaluation measures. While demonstrating the immediate
potential of hyperparameter tuning, we argue that future progress will depend
not only on architectural advances but also on clearer frameworks for
optimization and evaluation in complex, modular systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, further amplified by recent advances in
generative AI, poses significant threats to society, impacting public opinion,
democratic stability, and national security. Understanding and proactively
assessing these threats requires exploring methodologies that enable structured
and scalable misinformation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) as structured semantic resources
to systematically generate fake triplets. By analyzing the structural
properties of KGs, such as the distance between entities and their predicates,
we identify plausibly false relationships. These triplets are then used to
guide large language models (LLMs) in generating misinformation statements with
varying degrees of credibility. By utilizing structured semantic relationships,
our deterministic approach produces misinformation inherently challenging for
humans to detect, drawing exclusively upon publicly available KGs (e.g.,

*Xin Jing,Jiadong Wang,Iosif Tsangko,Andreas Triantafyllopoulos,Björn W. Schuller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用GPT-4o自动标注语音情感数据的方法，提出了一种无需人工监督的多模态情感数据集MELT，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别（SER）中的人工标注成本高且不一致，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本标注中表现出潜力，但其在语音情感数据标注中的应用尚未深入研究。

Method: 使用GPT-4o通过结构化文本提示标注《老友记》的多模态数据集，仅依赖文本输入生成情感标签。

Result: 提出的MELT数据集通过微调自监督学习模型，显著提升了语音情感识别的性能。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够生成准确且上下文相关的情感标注，MELT数据集为语音情感识别提供了有效的无监督标注解决方案。

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) has advanced significantly with
deep learning, annotation remains a major hurdle. Human annotation is not only
costly but also subject to inconsistencies annotators often have different
preferences and may lack the necessary contextual knowledge, which can lead to
varied and inaccurate labels. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged as a scalable alternative for annotating text data. However, the
potential of LLMs to perform emotional speech data annotation without human
supervision has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these problems,
we apply GPT-4o to annotate a multimodal dataset collected from the sitcom
Friends, using only textual cues as inputs. By crafting structured text
prompts, our methodology capitalizes on the knowledge GPT-4o has accumulated
during its training, showcasing that it can generate accurate and contextually
relevant annotations without direct access to multimodal inputs. Therefore, we
propose MELT, a multimodal emotion dataset fully annotated by GPT-4o. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of MELT by fine-tuning four self-supervised
learning (SSL) backbones and assessing speech emotion recognition performance
across emotion datasets. Additionally, our subjective experiments\' results
demonstrate a consistence performance improvement on SER.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NextLocMoE是一个基于大型语言模型和双层次混合专家设计的新框架，用于解决现有方法在捕捉位置语义和用户行为动态方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法充分捕捉真实世界位置的多功能语义，也无法建模不同用户群体的异质行为动态。

Method: NextLocMoE采用双层次混合专家设计，包括位置语义MoE和个性化MoE，并结合历史感知路由机制。

Result: 在多个真实城市数据集上的实验表明，NextLocMoE在预测准确性、跨域泛化和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: NextLocMoE通过其创新设计有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了位置预测的性能。

Abstract: Next location prediction plays a critical role in understanding human
mobility patterns. However, existing approaches face two core limitations: (1)
they fall short in capturing the complex, multi-functional semantics of
real-world locations; and (2) they lack the capacity to model heterogeneous
behavioral dynamics across diverse user groups. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce NextLocMoE, a novel framework built upon large language models (LLMs)
and structured around a dual-level Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Our
architecture comprises two specialized modules: a Location Semantics MoE that
operates at the embedding level to encode rich functional semantics of
locations, and a Personalized MoE embedded within the Transformer backbone to
dynamically adapt to individual user mobility patterns. In addition, we
incorporate a history-aware routing mechanism that leverages long-term
trajectory data to enhance expert selection and ensure prediction stability.
Empirical evaluations across several real-world urban datasets show that
NextLocMoE achieves superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy,
cross-domain generalization, and interpretability

Conclusion: 该研究为神经和符号计算的更深入集成提供了基础，展示了神经符号对的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of a \textbf{neuro-symbolic pair} -- neural and
symbolic approaches that are linked through a common knowledge representation.
Next, we present \textbf{taxonomic networks}, a type of discrimination network
in which nodes represent hierarchically organized taxonomic concepts. Using
this representation, we construct a novel neuro-symbolic pair and evaluate its
performance. We show that our symbolic method learns taxonomic nets more
efficiently with less data and compute, while the neural method finds
higher-accuracy taxonomic nets when provided with greater resources. As a
neuro-symbolic pair, these approaches can be used interchangeably based on
situational needs, with seamless translation between them when necessary. This
work lays the foundation for future systems that more fundamentally integrate
neural and symbolic computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测初创公司成功需要既准确又可解释的模型，现有方法往往缺乏透明度。

Method: 通过LLM生成弱启发式问题，经过筛选、排序和基于阈值的投票机制聚合，构建强集成预测器。

Result: 在10%成功率的测试集上，精确度达50%（比随机选择高5倍），结合专家启发式后提升至54%。

Conclusion: LLM推理与人类洞察结合，简单可解释的集成模型能支持高风险决策（如VC）。

Abstract: Predicting startup success requires models that are both accurate and
interpretable. We present a lightweight ensemble framework that combines YES/NO
questions generated by large language models (LLMs), forming a transparent
decision-making system. Each question acts as a weak heuristic, and by
filtering, ranking, and aggregating them through a threshold-based voting
mechanism, we construct a strong ensemble predictor. On a test set where 10% of
startups are classified as successful, our approach achieves a precision rate
of 50%, representing a 5x improvement over random selection, while remaining
fully transparent. When we incorporate expert-guided heuristics into the
generation process, performance improves further to 54% precision. These
results highlight the value of combining LLM reasoning with human insight and
demonstrate that simple, interpretable ensembles can support high-stakes
decisions in domains such as venture capital (VC).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdaCVD是一种基于大语言模型的心血管疾病风险预测框架，优于现有模型，能灵活整合多样患者信息并快速适应新人群。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心血管疾病风险预测模型过于简化患者信息且难以适应实际临床需求，需更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 基于UK Biobank超过50万参与者的数据，对大语言模型进行微调，开发了AdaCVD框架。

Result: AdaCVD在基准测试中表现优于传统风险评分和标准机器学习方法，并在不同人群中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdaCVD为动态医疗环境提供了灵活、AI驱动的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models are essential for
identifying high-risk individuals and guiding preventive actions. However,
existing models struggle with the challenges of real-world clinical practice as
they oversimplify patient profiles, rely on rigid input schemas, and are
sensitive to distribution shifts. We developed AdaCVD, an adaptable CVD risk
prediction framework built on large language models extensively fine-tuned on
over half a million participants from the UK Biobank. In benchmark comparisons,
AdaCVD surpasses established risk scores and standard machine learning
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, for the first
time, it addresses key clinical challenges across three dimensions: it flexibly
incorporates comprehensive yet variable patient information; it seamlessly
integrates both structured data and unstructured text; and it rapidly adapts to
new patient populations using minimal additional data. In stratified analyses,
it demonstrates robust performance across demographic, socioeconomic, and
clinical subgroups, including underrepresented cohorts. AdaCVD offers a
promising path toward more flexible, AI-driven clinical decision support tools
suited to the realities of heterogeneous and dynamic healthcare environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AXIOM的新架构，结合了贝叶斯方法的数据效率和深度强化学习的跨任务泛化能力，通过核心先验知识加速低数据环境下的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度强化学习（DRL）在数据效率上不如人类学习，而主动推理虽然能结合先验知识但缺乏跨任务灵活性。AXIOM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: AXIOM通过对象为中心的动态建模和稀疏交互，在线扩展生成模型结构，并利用贝叶斯模型简化实现泛化。

Result: AXIOM在仅10,000次交互步骤内掌握多种游戏，参数少且无需梯度优化计算。

Conclusion: AXIOM成功结合了贝叶斯方法和DRL的优势，为低数据环境下的高效学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art
performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to
human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their
interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating
sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify
the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference
models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they
lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we
propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of
core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate
learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM,
combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches
with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM
represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as
piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions.
The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and
learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through
Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games
within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters
compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based
optimization.

Conclusion: EXP-Bench为提升AI代理研究能力提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Automating AI research holds immense potential for accelerating scientific
progress, yet current AI agents struggle with the complexities of rigorous,
end-to-end experimentation. We introduce EXP-Bench, a novel benchmark designed
to systematically evaluate AI agents on complete research experiments sourced
from influential AI publications. Given a research question and incomplete
starter code, EXP-Bench challenges AI agents to formulate hypotheses, design
and implement experimental procedures, execute them, and analyze results. To
enable the creation of such intricate and authentic tasks with high-fidelity,
we design a semi-autonomous pipeline to extract and structure crucial
experimental details from these research papers and their associated
open-source code. With the pipeline, EXP-Bench curated 461 AI research tasks
from 51 top-tier AI research papers. Evaluations of leading LLM-based agents,
such as OpenHands and IterativeAgent on EXP-Bench demonstrate partial
capabilities: while scores on individual experimental aspects such as design or
implementation correctness occasionally reach 20-35%, the success rate for
complete, executable experiments was a mere 0.5%. By identifying these
bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures,
EXP-Bench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability
to conduct AI research experiments. EXP-Bench is open-sourced at

TL;DR: MiCRo提出了一种两阶段框架，通过上下文感知的混合建模和动态路由策略，解决了传统奖励建模无法捕捉多样化人类偏好的问题，显著提升了个性化对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Bradley-Terry模型的奖励建模假设全局奖励函数，无法捕捉人类偏好的多样性和异质性，限制了LLMs的个性化和多元化对齐能力。

Method: MiCRo采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过上下文感知混合建模捕捉多样化偏好；第二阶段通过动态路由策略调整混合权重，以最小监督实现高效偏好适应。

Result: 实验表明，MiCRo能有效捕捉多样化人类偏好，显著提升下游个性化任务的表现。

Conclusion: MiCRo为LLMs的个性化对齐提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，无需依赖精细标注。

Abstract: Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when
applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry
(BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently
diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification
limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment.
Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture
distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error.
While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained
annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by
predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values.
In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances
personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference
datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first
stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture
diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online
routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific
context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference
adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple
preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human
preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

Motivation: CAPTCHAs是部署网络代理的关键瓶颈，而现有MLLM代理在动态交互任务中的能力尚未充分测试。

Method: 开发了Open CaptchaWorld基准平台，包含20种CAPTCHA类型和225个测试案例，并提出了新的评估指标CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth。

Result: 人类表现接近完美（93.3%），而MLLM代理成功率最高仅40%。

Conclusion: Open CaptchaWorld揭示了当前多模态代理的局限性，为开发更强大的多模态推理系统提供了重要参考。

Abstract: CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in
real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end
automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated
impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle
interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.
To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based
benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning
and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic
CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225
CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,
which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each
puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect
scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates
at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,
93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing
the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more
robust multimodal reasoning systems. Code and Data are available at this https

Result: 实验证明该方法在数据稀缺和严格约束下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 该方法为绿色AI提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern
companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace
events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation
problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the
corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that
frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract
Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event
interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations
for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where
event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this
reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy
computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to
suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.
However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of
manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing
Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with
reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a
data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the
candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is
refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior
knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by
experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings
where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent
constraints.

Motivation: 现实应用中，强化学习常面临部分状态信息的问题，需要一种能够基于观测历史进行决策的框架。

Method: 提出了OPMDP框架和DATD3算法，结合深度可分离卷积和多头注意力机制编码历史观测数据。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，DATD3在部分和完全可观测性下均优于现有基于记忆和循环的基线方法。

Conclusion: DATD3在保持策略表达能力的同时避免了循环模型的不稳定性，适用于部分可观测环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in real-world applications often involves
output-feedback settings, where the agent receives only partial state
information. To address this challenge, we propose the Output-Feedback Markov
Decision Process (OPMDP), which extends the standard MDP formulation to
accommodate decision-making based on observation histories. Building on this
framework, we introduce Depthwise Attention Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DATD3), a novel actor-critic algorithm that employs depthwise
separable convolution and multi-head attention to encode historical
observations. DATD3 maintains policy expressiveness while avoiding the
instability of recurrent models. Extensive experiments on continuous control
tasks demonstrate that DATD3 outperforms existing memory-based and recurrent
baselines under both partial and full observability.

Result: 在视觉和视觉语言基准测试中，LOT Merging比基线方法性能提升高达4.4%。

Conclusion: LOT Merging通过高效矩阵操作实现模型合并，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-task model merging aims to consolidate knowledge from multiple
fine-tuned task-specific experts into a unified model while minimizing
performance degradation. Existing methods primarily approach this by minimizing
differences between task-specific experts and the unified model, either from a
parameter-level or a task-loss perspective. However, parameter-level methods
exhibit a significant performance gap compared to the upper bound, while
task-loss approaches entail costly secondary training procedures. In contrast,
we observe that performance degradation closely correlates with feature drift,
i.e., differences in feature representations of the same sample caused by model
merging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Layer-wise Optimal Task
Vector Merging (LOT Merging), a technique that explicitly minimizes feature
drift between task-specific experts and the unified model in a layer-by-layer
manner. LOT Merging can be formulated as a convex quadratic optimization
problem, enabling us to analytically derive closed-form solutions for the
parameters of linear and normalization layers. Consequently, LOT Merging
achieves efficient model consolidation through basic matrix operations.
Extensive experiments across vision and vision-language benchmarks demonstrate
that LOT Merging significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving
improvements of up to 4.4% (ViT-B/32) over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Drug repositioning aims to identify potential new indications for existing
drugs to reduce the time and financial costs associated with developing new
drugs. Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods
predominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug
repositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start
scenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information
with the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a
bidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as
BiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior
sequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First,
we construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease
sides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous
and rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we
construct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of
drugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and
bidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential
drug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more
robustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and
disease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark
datasets. Meanwhile, BiBLDR demonstrates significantly superior performance
compared to previous methods in cold-start scenarios. Our code is published in

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems from short-term observations remains
a fundamental and underexplored challenge due to the intrinsic sensitivity to
initial conditions and the complex geometry of strange attractors. Existing
approaches often rely on long-term training data or focus on short-term
sequence correlations, struggling to maintain predictive stability and
dynamical coherence over extended horizons. We propose PhyxMamba, a novel
framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed
principles to capture the underlying dynamics of chaotic systems. By
reconstructing the attractor manifold from brief observations using time-delay
embeddings, PhyxMamba extracts global dynamical features essential for accurate
forecasting. Our generative training scheme enables Mamba to replicate the
physical process, augmented by multi-token prediction and attractor geometry
regularization for physical constraints, enhancing prediction accuracy and
preserving key statistical invariants. Extensive evaluations on diverse
simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers
superior long-term forecasting and faithfully captures essential dynamical
invariants from short-term data. This framework opens new avenues for reliably
predicting chaotic systems under observation-scarce conditions, with broad
implications across climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, and beyond.

framework that learns to align, compare, and aggregate heterogeneously
distributed local models without sharing raw data or node embeddings. In
FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable
auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings
onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D
convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to
effectively capture client-specific information. After local training, these
APVs serve as compact signatures that the server uses to compute inter-client
similarities and perform similarity-weighted parameter mixing, yielding
personalized models while preserving cross-client knowledge transfer. Moreover,
we provide rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the convergence and
rationality of our design. Empirical evaluations across diverse graph
benchmarks demonstrate that FedAux substantially outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and personalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业需要高效的自主系统进行作物监测，但资源消耗需最小化。本文将其建模为网格环境中的主动探索问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：预训练的LSTM作为信念模型更新概率地图和熵，DQN和Double-CNN架构比较探索效率。

Result: Double-CNN架构在较大环境中表现最佳，不确定性感知策略显著提升探索效率。

Conclusion: 未来工作包括课程学习、多智能体合作和基于Transformer的模型，以进一步提升学习效率和策略泛化能力。

Abstract: Precision agriculture requires efficient autonomous systems for crop
monitoring, where agents must explore large-scale environments while minimizing
resource consumption. This work addresses the problem as an active exploration
task in a grid environment representing an agricultural field. Each cell may
contain targets (e.g., damaged crops) observable from nine predefined points of
view (POVs). Agents must infer the number of targets per cell using partial,
sequential observations.
  We propose a two-stage deep learning framework. A pre-trained LSTM serves as
a belief model, updating a probabilistic map of the environment and its
associated entropy, which defines the expected information gain (IG). This
allows agents to prioritize informative regions. A key contribution is the
inclusion of a POV visibility mask in the input, preserving the Markov property
under partial observability and avoiding revisits to already explored views.
  Three agent architectures were compared: an untrained IG-based agent
selecting actions to maximize entropy reduction; a DQN agent using CNNs over
local 3x3 inputs with belief, entropy, and POV mask; and a Double-CNN DQN agent
with wider spatial context. Simulations on 20x20 maps showed that the untrained
agent performs well despite its simplicity. The DQN agent matches this
performance when the POV mask is included, while the Double-CNN agent
consistently achieves superior exploration efficiency, especially in larger
environments.
  Results show that uncertainty-aware policies leveraging entropy, belief
states, and visibility tracking lead to robust and scalable exploration. Future
work includes curriculum learning, multi-agent cooperation with shared rewards,
transformer-based models, and intrinsic motivation mechanisms to further
enhance learning efficiency and policy generalization.

Method: 采用SAM（锐度感知最小化）及其变体CSAM，通过隐式最大化预测分布的熵来改善校准。

Result: 实验表明，SAM能显著降低校准误差，CSAM表现更优。

Conclusion: SAM和CSAM能有效解决深度神经网络的校准问题，CSAM表现最佳。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been increasingly used in safety-critical
applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. However, many
studies suggest that they are prone to being poorly calibrated and have a
propensity for overconfidence, which may have disastrous consequences. In this
paper, unlike standard training such as stochastic gradient descent, we show
that the recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) counteracts this
tendency towards overconfidence. The theoretical analysis suggests that SAM
allows us to learn models that are already well-calibrated by implicitly
maximizing the entropy of the predictive distribution. Inspired by this
finding, we further propose a variant of SAM, coined as CSAM, to ameliorate
model calibration. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including
ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the benefits of SAM in reducing calibration error.
Meanwhile, CSAM performs even better than SAM and consistently achieves lower
calibration error than other approaches

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法易受噪声数据干扰，传统噪声处理方法依赖繁琐的数据预处理或易导致误差累积的模型架构修改。

Method: LoPE采用两阶段范式，在微调阶段对专用污染专家进行噪声注入以增强其噪声识别与处理能力，推理阶段选择性屏蔽该专家以利用正常专家获取的纯净知识。

Result: 实验表明，LoPE仅通过低成本噪声注入即可实现高性能和鲁棒性，完全无需数据清洗。

Conclusion: LoPE为噪声环境下的模型适应提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained
language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy
data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data
pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error
accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a
noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a
novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated
noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE
strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA
configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on
the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and
processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated
poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for
noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves
strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection,
which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine
Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal
parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea
is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of
cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically,
it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete
cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of
the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency
components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language
understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as
multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP
consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational
complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.

Conclusion: ADG通过扩散模型有效解决数据损坏问题，且能与任何离线RL算法无缝集成，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise
and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing
corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption
in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the
dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong
denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their
tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To
overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a
novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data
corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable
learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second,
we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between
clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard
DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously
identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL
training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly
integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks,
including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively
mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline
RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Result: 结果显示同质和多关系设置之间存在性能差异，强调了结构表示的重要性。

Conclusion: RelSC是一个具有挑战性和多样性的基准，有助于推动图回归方法的发展。

Abstract: Graph-level regression underpins many real-world applications, yet public
benchmarks remain heavily skewed toward molecular graphs and citation networks.
This limited diversity hinders progress on models that must generalize across
both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph structures. We introduce RelSC, a new
graph-regression dataset built from program graphs that combine syntactic and
semantic information extracted from source code. Each graph is labelled with
the execution-time cost of the corresponding program, providing a continuous
target variable that differs markedly from those found in existing benchmarks.
RelSC is released in two complementary variants. RelSC-H supplies rich node
features under a single (homogeneous) edge type, while RelSC-M preserves the
original multi-relational structure, connecting nodes through multiple edge
types that encode distinct semantic relationships. Together, these variants let
researchers probe how representation choice influences model behaviour. We
evaluate a diverse set of graph neural network architectures on both variants
of RelSC. The results reveal consistent performance differences between the
homogeneous and multi-relational settings, emphasising the importance of
structural representation. These findings demonstrate RelSC's value as a
challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing graph regression methods.

Motivation: 现有在线数据混合方法未考虑域内交互且未随训练动态调整，导致预训练效率低。

Method: 使用Actor-Critic网络动态调整领域权重，并通过奖励函数考虑域内交互，将小代理模型的采样策略直接应用于目标模型。

Result: AC-ODM-410M在验证困惑度上比ODM快71%达到最优，MMLU零样本准确率提升27.5%，HumanEval pass@1提升2.23倍。

Conclusion: AC-ODM方法显著提升了预训练效率和模型性能，为动态数据混合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The coverage and composition of pretraining data significantly impacts the
generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). To reduce the carbon
footprint and financial costs of training, some data mixing methods, which
applied the optimized domain weights of a small proxy model to train a larger
one, were proposed. However, these methods did not evolute with the training
dynamics. The existing online data mixing (ODM) method addressed this
limitation by applying the multi-armed bandit algorithm as data sampling
strategy. Yet, it did not consider the intra-domain interactions. In this
paper, we develop an actor-critic based online data mixing (AC-ODM) method,
which captures the varying domain weights by auxiliary actor-critic networks
and consider the intra-domain interactions with the reward function. While
constructing the dataset to pretrain a large target LLM, we directly apply the
actor, which is trained with a small proxy LLM as the environment, as the
sampling strategy. The transfer of sampling strategy can not only ensure the
efficiency of dynamical data mixing, but also expedite the convergence of
pretraining the target LLM. Numerical results demonstrate that AC-ODM-410M,
which invokes the sampling strategy obtained by a proxy LLM with 410M
parameters, reaching the optimal validation perplexity of ODM 71% faster, and
improves performance on the zero-shot MMLU benchmark by 27.5% of accuracy,
about 2.23x better on pass@1 of HumanEval benchmark.

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM模型有效预测COVID-19严重程度，展示了AI在基因组监测和精准公共卫生中的潜力，为未来疫情早期预测提供了框架。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the critical need
for accurate prediction of disease severity to optimize healthcare resource
allocation and patient management. The spike protein, which facilitates viral
entry into host cells, exhibits high mutation rates, particularly in the
receptor-binding domain, influencing viral pathogenicity. Artificial
intelligence approaches, such as deep learning, offer promising solutions for
leveraging genomic and clinical data to predict disease outcomes. Objective:
This study aimed to develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model to predict
COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and associated clinical
metadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike
protein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion
criteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154
mild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences,
while demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded. A hybrid
CNN-LSTM architecture was trained, combining CNN layers for local pattern
extraction and an LSTM layer for long-term dependency modeling. Results: The
model achieved an F1 score of 82.92%, ROC-AUC of 0.9084, precision of 83.56%,
and recall of 82.85%, demonstrating robust classification performance. Training
stabilized at 85% accuracy with minimal overfitting. The most prevalent
lineages (P.1, AY.99.2) and clades (GR, GK) aligned with regional
epidemiological trends, suggesting potential associations between viral
genetics and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM hybrid model
effectively predicted COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and
clinical data, highlighting the utility of AI in genomic surveillance and
precision public health. Despite limitations, this approach provides a
framework for early severity prediction in future outbreaks.

Conclusion: LaCT为长上下文建模和测试时训练提供了高效解决方案，有望推动该领域研究。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) models context dependencies by adapting part of the
model's weights (referred to as fast weights) during inference. This fast
weight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past
tokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show
effectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on
modern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely
low FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online
minibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,
a small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the
data, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or
N-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the
opposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to
1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk
Test-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of
magnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size
(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,
all without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It
also allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online
updates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,
including novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and
auto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR
video diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence
experiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We
hope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of
long-context modeling and test-time training. Website:

Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box functions is ubiquitous in science
and engineering. A common solution to this problem is Bayesian optimization
(BO), which is generally comprised of two components: (i) a surrogate model and
(ii) an acquisition function, which generally require expensive re-training and
optimization steps at each iteration, respectively. Although recent work
enabled in-context surrogate models that do not require re-training, virtually
all existing BO methods still require acquisition function maximization to
select the next observation, which introduces many knobs to tune, such as Monte
Carlo samplers and multi-start optimizers. In this work, we propose a
completely in-context, zero-shot solution for BO that does not require
surrogate fitting or acquisition function optimization. This is done by using a
pre-trained deep generative model to directly sample from the posterior over
the optimum point. We show that this process is equivalent to Thompson sampling
and demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of our foundation model
on a suite of real-world benchmarks. We achieve an efficiency gain of more than
35x in terms of wall-clock time when compared with Gaussian process-based BO,
enabling efficient parallel and distributed BO, e.g., for high-throughput
optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great
empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency
of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider
the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the
learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a
model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson
sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman
eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other
multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the
$log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we
first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error
bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound,
which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may
be of independent interest.

Motivation: 解决在微调或任务特定数据收集中人类对齐行为易丢失的问题，提供一种可扩展的方法来部署安全的AI系统。

Method: 提出BIRD框架，通过匹配教师和学生模型的内部表示结构来传递对齐行为，应用于图像分类任务。

Result: BIRD在鲁棒性上优于微调、迁移学习和持续学习方法，提升鲁棒准确率高达16%，且教师模型规模小25倍时仍有效。

Conclusion: BIRD将小型对齐模型转化为可扩展的种子，为安全AI系统的部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Human-aligned deep learning models exhibit behaviors consistent with human
values, such as robustness, fairness, and honesty. Transferring these
behavioral properties to models trained on different tasks or data
distributions remains challenging: aligned behavior is easily forgotten during
fine-tuning, and collecting task-specific data that preserves this behavior can
be prohibitively costly. We introduce BIRD (Behavior Induction via
Representation-structure Distillation), a flexible framework for transferring
aligned behavior by matching the internal representation structure of a student
model to that of a teacher. Applied to out-of-distribution robustness in image
classification, BIRD outperforms fine-tuning, transfer learning, and continual
learning methods, improving robust accuracy by up to 16% over the next
strongest baseline. It remains effective even when the teacher is trained on a
much simpler dataset and is $25 \times$ smaller than the student. In a
large-scale study of over 400 teacher-student pairs, we show that three
interpretable and computable properties of the teacher's representations (i.e.,
task relevance, behavioral relevance, and complementary knowledge) explain up
to 85% of the variance in transfer success. These insights offer practical
guidance for teacher selection and design. BIRD turns small, well-aligned
models into scalable alignment seeds, removing a key bottleneck in deploying
safe AI systems in the wild.

this method safeguards sensitive information, including industrial secrets and

*An Vo,Khai-Nguyen Nguyen,Mohammad Reza Taesiri,Vy Tuong Dang,Anh Totti Nguyen,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）因记忆大量先验知识而在标准视觉任务（如计数和识别）中表现偏差，准确性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）的先验知识如何影响视觉语言模型（VLMs）在客观视觉任务中的表现，尤其是偏差问题。

Method: 通过测试VLMs在多个领域的计数任务（如条纹计数）中的表现，并插入描述性文本以观察其对准确性的影响。

Result: VLMs在计数任务中平均准确率仅为17.05%，且插入文本进一步降低准确性。指令调整对准确性提升有限（仅+2%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs的偏差问题，并提出了一个自动化测试框架，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from
the Internet that help them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway
their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the
knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models
(VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a
fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of
17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo)
across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical
illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the
subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The
biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their
results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting
accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting
failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code

TL;DR: SG-Blend是一种新型激活函数，通过动态插值结合了SSwish和GELU的优点，提升了深度神经网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数（如Swish和GELU）在不同领域表现不一，SG-Blend旨在通过结合SSwish的对称性和GELU的平滑性，实现更通用的性能优化。

Method: SG-Blend通过可学习参数动态混合SSwish和GELU，利用两者的互补优势。

Result: 在多种自然语言和计算机视觉任务中，SG-Blend均表现出性能提升，且计算开销极低。

Conclusion: SG-Blend是一种高效且通用的激活函数，可作为现有方法的替代方案。

Abstract: The design of activation functions remains a pivotal component in optimizing
deep neural networks. While prevailing choices like Swish and GELU demonstrate
considerable efficacy, they often exhibit domain-specific optima. This work
introduces SG-Blend, a novel activation function that blends our proposed
SSwish, a first-order symmetric variant of Swish and the established GELU
through dynamic interpolation. By adaptively blending these constituent
functions via learnable parameters, SG-Blend aims to harness their
complementary strengths: SSwish's controlled non-monotonicity and symmetry, and
GELU's smooth, probabilistic profile, to achieve a more universally robust
balance between model expressivity and gradient stability. We conduct
comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse modalities and
architectures, showing performance improvements across all considered natural
language and computer vision tasks and models. These results, achieved with
negligible computational overhead, underscore SG-Blend's potential as a
versatile, drop-in replacement that consistently outperforms strong
contemporary baselines. The code is available at

Motivation: 在预训练计算资源快速增加而真实数据生成停滞的背景下，PFNs 能够高效分配预训练计算资源，解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: PFNs 通过随机生成的人工数据集训练神经网络，捕捉先验分布，并扩展到更复杂的领域和大数据集。

Conclusion: PFNs 和摊销推断方法是贝叶斯推断的未来研究方向，具有广阔的应用前景，但仍需解决当前限制。

Abstract: Training neural networks on randomly generated artificial datasets yields
Bayesian models that capture the prior defined by the dataset-generating
distribution. Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) are a class of methods designed
to leverage this insight. In an era of rapidly increasing computational
resources for pre-training and a near stagnation in the generation of new
real-world data in many applications, PFNs are poised to play a more important
role across a wide range of applications. They enable the efficient allocation
of pre-training compute to low-data scenarios. Originally applied to small
Bayesian modeling tasks, the field of PFNs has significantly expanded to
address more complex domains and larger datasets. This position paper argues
that PFNs and other amortized inference approaches represent the future of
Bayesian inference, leveraging amortized learning to tackle data-scarce
problems. We thus believe they are a fruitful area of research. In this
position paper, we explore their potential and directions to address their
current limitations.

*Xiang Meng,Mehdi Makni,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的可转置N:M稀疏掩码求解器，适用于大规模模型，解决了现有方法在训练中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N:M稀疏性在训练中因矩阵转置问题效率受限，现有方法无法扩展到大型模型或仅限于M=4。

Method: 将掩码生成建模为最优传输问题，通过熵正则化和Dykstra算法求解，并采用GPU并行实现。

Result: 方法在LLaMA3.2-8B模型上表现接近标准N:M稀疏模型，优于标准2:4稀疏模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可高效生成任意N:M值的可转置稀疏掩码，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Network pruning reduces the computational requirements of large neural
networks, with N:M sparsity -- retaining only N out of every M consecutive
weights -- offering a compelling balance between compressed model quality and
hardware acceleration. However, N:M sparsity only accelerates forward-pass
computations, as N:M patterns are not preserved during matrix transposition,
limiting efficiency during training where both passes are computationally
intensive. While transposable N:M sparsity has been proposed to address this
limitation, existing methods for finding transposable N:M sparse masks either
fail to scale to large models or are restricted to M=4 which results in
suboptimal compression-accuracy trade-off. We introduce an efficient solver for
transposable N:M masks that scales to billion-parameter models. We formulate
mask generation as optimal transport problems and solve through entropy
regularization and Dykstra's algorithm, followed by a rounding procedure. Our
tensor-based implementation exploits GPU parallelism, achieving up to 100x
speedup with only 1-10% error compared to existing methods. Our approach can be
integrated with layer-wise N:M pruning frameworks including Wanda, SparseGPT
and ALPS to produce transposable N:M sparse models with arbitrary N:M values.
Experiments show that LLaMA3.2-8B with transposable 16:32 sparsity maintains
performance close to its standard N:M counterpart and outperforms standard 2:4
sparse model, showing the practical value of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果方法，区分代理人的虚假报告与真实修改，通过比较操纵与非操纵数据集中的因果效应，识别虚假报告率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源分配中，代理人可能策略性修改特征以获得更好结果，但区分虚假报告与真实修改是挑战。

Method: 利用因果效应不对称性，比较操纵与非操纵数据集中特征对下游变量的影响。

Result: 理论证明了虚假报告率的可识别性，并通过半合成和真实数据验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于现实场景中识别虚假报告。

Abstract: In settings where ML models are used to inform the allocation of resources,
agents affected by the allocation decisions might have an incentive to
strategically change their features to secure better outcomes. While prior work
has studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from
genuine modification remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose
a causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent
misreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features
from genuine modification. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine
modification, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables
(i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal
effect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from
manipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally
prove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of
our estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a
semi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating
that our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world
scenarios.

Result: 揭示了语言结构与神经网络性能驱动结构之间的相似性，并提出了高效估计向量空间熵的新方法。

Conclusion: 研究为理解大规模分布式认知模型的学习机制提供了新视角，并揭示了其与人类认知的相似性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still
lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational
spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are
structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of
structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for
identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages
them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information,
what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions
condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural
primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic
quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and
generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models,
sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language
Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the
entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models
ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models
of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems
and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the
constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of
structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

Method: 基于边缘的预测模型，将高顶点和低顶点的约束分开处理，并巧妙结合结果。

Result: 针对MaxCut、Vertex Cover、Set Cover和Maximum Independent Set等问题，算法实现了改进的近似比。

Conclusion: 通过结合预测信息，算法在多个NP难图问题上取得了显著改进，展示了预测模型的有效性。

Abstract: We design improved approximation algorithms for NP-hard graph problems by
incorporating predictions (e.g., learned from past data). Our prediction model
builds upon and extends the $\varepsilon$-prediction framework by Cohen-Addad,
d'Orsi, Gupta, Lee, and Panigrahi (NeurIPS 2024). We consider an edge-based
version of this model, where each edge provides two bits of information,
corresponding to predictions about whether each of its endpoints belong to an
optimal solution. Even with weak predictions where each bit is only
$\varepsilon$-correlated with the true solution, this information allows us to
break approximation barriers in the standard setting. We develop algorithms
with improved approximation ratios for MaxCut, Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and
Maximum Independent Set problems (among others). Across these problems, our
algorithms share a unifying theme, where we separately satisfy constraints
related to high degree vertices (using predictions) and low-degree vertices
(without using predictions) and carefully combine the answers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接测量临界批量大小（CBS）的简单经验方法，并研究了CBS在训练过程中的变化。通过实验发现，CBS在训练初期迅速增长后趋于稳定，且这一趋势在不同规模的模型中一致。基于此，作者提出了批量大小预热策略，以更高效地训练大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度噪声尺度估计CBS的方法依赖强假设，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在提供一种更直接、可靠的CBS测量方法，并探索其在训练中的动态变化。

Method: 提出了一种直接测量CBS的经验方法，并通过实验观察CBS在训练过程中的变化。此外，提出了批量大小预热策略，逐步增加批量大小以适应CBS的增长。

Result: 实验发现CBS在训练初期从0迅速增长后趋于稳定，且这一趋势在不同模型规模（1B和7B）中一致。使用批量大小预热策略训练OLMo 1B模型，比原始训练减少了43%的梯度步骤，且性能略有提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出的CBS测量方法和批量大小预热策略为高效训练大模型提供了可靠框架，能够在增加数据并行性的同时保持性能。

Abstract: The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a
large batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too
large will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.
(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not
substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale
during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when
training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a
proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be
trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a
simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS
evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that
CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus
as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across
different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can
inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over
training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language
models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the
CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to
slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient
steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language
models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步联邦学习因设备异构性导致延迟问题，现有解决方案（如固定截止时间）效果有限。

Method: ADEL-FL通过约束优化问题联合优化每轮截止时间和用户特定批量大小，并提供了收敛性分析。

Result: 实验表明，ADEL-FL在异构条件下在收敛速度和最终准确性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ADEL-FL是一种有效的解决方案，能够显著提升联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed edge devices while preserving data privacy, and typically operates
in a round-based synchronous manner. However, synchronous FL suffers from
latency bottlenecks due to device heterogeneity, where slower clients
(stragglers) delay or degrade global updates. Prior solutions, such as fixed
deadlines, client selection, and layer-wise partial aggregation, alleviate the
effect of stragglers, but treat round timing and local workload as static
parameters, limiting their effectiveness under strict time constraints. We
propose ADEL-FL, a novel framework that jointly optimizes per-round deadlines
and user-specific batch sizes for layer-wise aggregation. Our approach
formulates a constrained optimization problem minimizing the expected L2
distance to the global optimum under total training time and global rounds. We
provide a convergence analysis under exponential compute models and prove that
ADEL-FL yields unbiased updates with bounded variance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ADEL-FL outperforms alternative methods in both convergence
rate and final accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.

Result: GeLLMO-Cs在5个分布内和5个分布外任务中表现优异，成功率提升126%，并展示零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeLLMO-Cs为支持现实多样化的属性特异性优化提供了基础LLM。

Abstract: In real-world drug design, molecule optimization requires selectively
improving multiple molecular properties up to pharmaceutically relevant levels,
while maintaining others that already meet such criteria. However, existing
computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such
nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability.
To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning
dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific
objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of
instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific
optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5
out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong
baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit
impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen
instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support
realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives.

Motivation: 时间序列可以转化为图像和文本等多模态视图（MMVs），但现有大型视觉模型（LVMs）在LTSF中存在对“预测周期”的归纳偏差。本文旨在利用这一偏差，提升预测性能。

Method: 提出DMMV框架，结合趋势-季节性分解和反演残差自适应分解，整合多模态视图以优化LTSF。

Result: 在8个基准数据集中的6个上，DMMV均方误差（MSE）表现最佳，优于14种现有先进模型。

Conclusion: DMMV通过多模态视图和分解方法，显著提升了长期时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be
transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the
same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable
the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models
(LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified
in this work, applying LVMs to LTSF poses an inductive bias towards
"forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel
decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal
decomposition and a novel backcast residual based adaptive decomposition to
integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view
and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE)
on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 无学习率方法仍有改进空间，需通过强基准测试推动超参数减少技术的发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in methodology, hyperparameter tuning remains a
crucial (and expensive) part of the development of machine learning systems.
Even ignoring architectural choices, deep neural networks have a large number
of optimization and regularization hyperparameters that need to be tuned
carefully per workload in order to obtain the best results. In a perfect world,
training algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning,
but would instead have default settings that performed well across many
workloads. Recently, there has been a growing literature on optimization
methods which attempt to reduce the number of hyperparameters -- particularly
the learning rate and its accompanying schedule. Given these developments, how
far away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely
obviate the need for painful tuning?
  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as
components of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate)
hyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the
recently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that
literature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we
performed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across
all workloads simultaneously. The best AlgoPerf-calibrated learning-rate-free
methods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a
similarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score. Our results
suggest that there is still much room for improvement for learning-rate-free
methods, and that testing against a strong, workload-agnostic baseline is
important to improve hyperparameter reduction techniques.

Method: 在合成数据上训练两层ReLU神经网络，分析Adam和GD的隐式偏差，并通过理论证明和实验验证。

Result: GD倾向于生成线性边界和次优边距，而Adam生成非线性边界，接近贝叶斯最优预测器，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差使其在复杂任务中表现优于GD，尤其是在存在虚假相关性和分布偏移的情况下。

Abstract: Adam is the de facto optimization algorithm for several deep learning
applications, but an understanding of its implicit bias and how it differs from
other algorithms, particularly standard first-order methods such as
(stochastic) gradient descent (GD), remains limited. In practice, neural
networks trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to
find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such
simplicity bias. To demystify this phenomenon, in this paper, we investigate
the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer
ReLU neural networks on a binary classification task involving synthetic data
with Gaussian clusters. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting
in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to
much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is
closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also
allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under
certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing
the population gradients. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we present
empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior
generalization across datasets with spurious correlations where neural networks
trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and don't generalize well
under certain distributional shifts.

Method: 研究设计了首个系统性实验，涵盖4种LVMs、8种成像方法、18个数据集和26个基线模型，覆盖分类和预测任务，并进行广泛的消融分析。

Result: 结果表明，LVMs在时间序列分类中有效，但在预测任务中表现受限，且当前最佳LVM预测器仅适用于特定类型和成像方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series
research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation
models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality,
Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past,
the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When
it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time
series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled
study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across
both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with
extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for
time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although
effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types
of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and
have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings
could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based
solutions to different time series tasks.

approach for improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In
practice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly
challenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy
models with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters.
  In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL
framework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various
model sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a
handful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined,
single-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling
modularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also
provide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal
proof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically, by
leveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous
off-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight
synchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x
speed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy
model. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing
model scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale
RL training.

*Guangtao Zheng,Wenqian Ye,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuronTune是一种无需外部标注的自引导方法，通过干预模型内部决策过程来减轻虚假偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络常因非本质特征与类别间的虚假相关性而产生偏差，现有方法依赖外部标注，难以获取且不通用。

Method: NeuronTune通过探测模型的潜在嵌入空间，识别并调控导致虚假预测行为的神经元。

Result: 实验表明，NeuronTune能显著减轻虚假偏差，且无需虚假相关性标注。

Conclusion: NeuronTune是一种实用且有效的自引导方法，可提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often develop spurious bias, reliance on correlations
between non-essential features and classes for predictions. For example, a
model may identify objects based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather
than intrinsic features, resulting in degraded performance on data lacking
these correlations. Existing mitigation approaches typically depend on external
annotations of spurious correlations, which may be difficult to obtain and are
not relevant to the spurious bias in a model. In this paper, we take a step
towards self-guided mitigation of spurious bias by proposing NeuronTune, a post
hoc method that directly intervenes in a model's internal decision process. Our
method probes in a model's latent embedding space to identify and regulate
neurons that lead to spurious prediction behaviors. We theoretically justify
our approach and show that it brings the model closer to an unbiased one.
Unlike previous methods, NeuronTune operates without requiring spurious
correlation annotations, making it a practical and effective tool for improving
model robustness. Experiments across different architectures and data
modalities demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates spurious bias in
a self-guided way.

*Elpiniki Maria Lygizou,Mónika Farsang,Radu Grosu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多头部差分门控自注意力机制（M-DGSA），通过动态抑制注意力噪声提升Transformer的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自注意力对所有查询-键交互一视同仁，导致Transformer对噪声输入敏感。受生物神经侧抑制启发，结合差分Transformer的双并行softmax减法噪声消除方法，提出动态门控机制。

Method: M-DGSA将每个注意力头分为兴奋和抑制分支，通过token嵌入预测的sigmoid门融合双softmax映射，实现上下文感知的对比增强。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，M-DGSA相比标准Transformer、Vision Transformer和差分Transformer基线均表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贡献包括：（i）基于侧抑制的动态门控机制；（ii）生物对比增强与自注意力理论的结合；（iii）跨领域噪声鲁棒性验证。

Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to
corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key
interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural
circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use
of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose
Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head
input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head
splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are
fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a
context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing
Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both
vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over
vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer
baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism
for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis
of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii)
comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain
applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，通过链接预测连接源图和目标图的节点，以促进消息传递并减少分布偏移，同时设计了身份保留学习目标以保持目标图的判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在节点分类上表现优异，但依赖大量标注数据。无监督域适应（UDA）可解决新领域标注数据稀缺问题，但现有方法未充分考虑图结构和消息传递机制，且在标签分布偏移时失效。

Method: 采用链接预测连接源图和目标图节点，修改目标图以减少其在嵌入空间中的分布偏移，并设计身份保留学习目标以防止判别信息丢失。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过链接预测和身份保留学习，有效解决了GNNs在无监督域适应中的分布偏移和标签分布不均衡问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability for node classification
on graphs. However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while
obtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly
emerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a
classifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target
graph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been
proposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target
graphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply
adopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically
distributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do
not fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs
during the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among
domains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link
prediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can
facilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the
target nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain.
This strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its
deviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to
disproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of
discriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel
identity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge
insertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过使用单说话者长时MRI数据，开发了单模态和多模态模型，以研究语音识别中声学和发音的关系，并分析各模态的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究依赖多说话者数据，无法详细学习声学与发音的关系，本研究旨在通过单说话者数据解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了单模态（音频、视频）和多模态模型，用于音素识别，并分析其潜在空间和注意力权重。

Result: 音频和多模态模型在不同发音方式类别上表现相似，但在发音部位上存在差异；潜在空间显示音素编码相似，注意力权重揭示了声学和发音时间的差异。

Conclusion: 单说话者数据有助于更详细地研究声学与发音的关系，多模态模型揭示了模态间的互补性。

Abstract: Although many previous studies have carried out multimodal learning with
real-time MRI data that captures the audio-visual kinematics of the vocal tract
during speech, these studies have been limited by their reliance on
multi-speaker corpora. This prevents such models from learning a detailed
relationship between acoustics and articulation due to considerable
cross-speaker variability. In this study, we develop unimodal audio and video
models as well as multimodal models for phoneme recognition using a long-form
single-speaker MRI corpus, with the goal of disentangling and interpreting the
contributions of each modality. Audio and multimodal models show similar
performance on different phonetic manner classes but diverge on places of
articulation. Interpretation of the models' latent space shows similar encoding
of the phonetic space across audio and multimodal models, while the models'
attention weights highlight differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for
certain phonemes.

Method: 通过训练布尔函数，利用Monte Carlo学习算法，研究网络的训练动态和特征形成。

Result: 模型展示了可预测的训练动态和可解释特征的出现，揭示了归纳偏置和特征形成如何驱动泛化。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解网络归纳偏置、特征学习与泛化之间的关系提供了详细分析。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are renowned for their ability to generalise well across
diverse tasks, even when heavily overparameterized. Existing works offer only
partial explanations (for example, the NTK-based task-model alignment
explanation neglects feature learning). Here, we provide an end-to-end,
analytically tractable case study that links a network's inductive prior, its
training dynamics including feature learning, and its eventual generalisation.
Specifically, we exploit the one-to-one correspondence between depth-2 discrete
fully connected networks and disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas by training
on Boolean functions. Under a Monte Carlo learning algorithm, our model
exhibits predictable training dynamics and the emergence of interpretable
features. This framework allows us to trace, in detail, how inductive bias and
feature formation drive generalisation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出GraMa（梯度幅度神经活动度量），一种轻量级、架构无关的度量方法，用于量化神经元级学习能力，替代传统的tau-dormant神经元比率，并在多种架构中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习（RL）代理常因神经元活动丧失而难以适应新数据并持续学习，现有方法（如tau-dormant神经元比率）在复杂架构中统计效力不足。

Method: 提出GraMa，将统计目标从激活转向梯度，量化神经元的学习能力，并基于GraMa设计ReGraMa（重置神经元方法）。

Result: GraMa在多种架构（如残差网络、扩散模型）中有效揭示神经元不活跃性，ReGraMa在MuJoCo和DeepMind Control Suite等基准测试中提升学习性能。

Conclusion: GraMa和ReGraMa为深度RL代理提供了一种更有效的神经元学习能力度量与优化方法，适用于复杂架构。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently suffer from neuronal
activity loss, which impairs their ability to adapt to new data and learn
continually. A common method to quantify and address this issue is the
tau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the
expressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents,
this approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address
this, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning
capacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than
preserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the
statistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa
(Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight,
architecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity. We
show that GraMa effectively reveals persistent neuron inactivity across diverse
architectures, including residual networks, diffusion models, and agents with
varied activation functions. Moreover, resetting neurons guided by GraMa
(ReGraMa) consistently improves learning performance across multiple deep RL
algorithms and benchmarks, such as MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展神经算法推理（NAR）到更难的问题（如NP难问题）是一个未解决的挑战，而传统方法主要关注多项式时间可解问题。

Method: 利用原始-对偶范式和二分图表示，将原始-对偶算法与图神经网络对齐，并结合小实例的最优解提升模型推理能力。

Result: 模型不仅能模拟近似算法，还在多个任务中超越它们，且在大规模和分布外图上具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际应用价值，可与商业求解器结合并应用于真实数据集。

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) trains neural networks to simulate
classical algorithms, enabling structured and interpretable reasoning over
complex data. While prior research has predominantly focused on learning exact
algorithms for polynomial-time-solvable problems, extending NAR to harder
problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a general NAR
framework grounded in the primal-dual paradigm, a classical method for
designing efficient approximation algorithms. By leveraging a bipartite
representation between primal and dual variables, we establish an alignment
between primal-dual algorithms and Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, we
incorporate optimal solutions from small instances to greatly enhance the
model's reasoning capabilities. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
model not only simulates but also outperforms approximation algorithms for
multiple tasks, exhibiting robust generalization to larger and
out-of-distribution graphs. Moreover, we highlight the framework's practical
utility by integrating it with commercial solvers and applying it to real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注高层次应用评估，缺乏对数据关系结构推理能力的专门测试，因此需要DSR-Bench填补这一空白。

Method: DSR-Bench包含20种数据结构、35种操作和4140个问题实例，采用自动化、确定性的评估流程，避免主观判断。

Result: 评估显示，指令调优模型在基础多属性和多跳推理上表现不佳，推理导向模型在复杂结构上仍脆弱，最佳模型挑战子集平均得分仅47%。

Conclusion: 模型在多维数据和自然语言任务描述上表现差，揭示了实际部署中的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for real-world tasks
that fundamentally involve data manipulation. A core requirement across these
tasks is the ability to perform structural reasoning--that is, to understand
and reason about data relationships. For example, customer requests require a
temporal ordering, which can be represented by data structures such as queues.
However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-level, application-driven
evaluations without isolating this fundamental capability. To address this gap,
we introduce DSR-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLMs' structural reasoning
capabilities through data structures, which provide interpretable
representations of data relationships. DSR-Bench includes 20 data structures,
35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances, organized hierarchically for
fine-grained analysis of reasoning limitations. Our evaluation pipeline is
fully automated and deterministic, eliminating subjective human or model-based
judgments. Its synthetic nature also ensures scalability and minimizes data
contamination risks. We benchmark nine state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis
shows that instruction-tuned models struggle with basic multi-attribute and
multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, while reasoning-oriented models perform
better, they remain fragile on complex and hybrid structures, with the best
model achieving an average score of only 47% on the challenge subset.
Crucially, models often perform poorly on multi-dimensional data and natural
language task descriptions, highlighting a critical gap for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia associated with
elevated health risks, where timely detection is pivotal for mitigating
stroke-related morbidity. This study introduces an innovative hybrid
methodology integrating unsupervised deep learning and gradient boosting models
to improve AF detection. A 19-layer deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is
coupled with three boosting classifiers-AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM
(LGBM)-to harness their complementary advantages while addressing individual
limitations. The proposed framework uniquely combines DCAE with gradient
boosting, enabling end-to-end AF identification devoid of manual feature
extraction. The DCAE-LGBM model attains an F1-score of 95.20%, sensitivity of
99.99%, and inference latency of four seconds, outperforming existing methods
and aligning with clinical deployment requirements. The DCAE integration
significantly enhances boosting models, positioning this hybrid system as a
reliable tool for automated AF detection in clinical settings.

Result: 实验表明Proxy-FDA显著减少概念遗忘，并在多种微调设置和任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Proxy-FDA有效保留了预训练模型的结构知识，减少了微调时的概念遗忘，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich
representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream
tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often
leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of
robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without
affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching
the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such
point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the
feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose
a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the
structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution
Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and
fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative
proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments
show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during
fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a
distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further
demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end,
few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image
classification, captioning and VQA.

Conclusion: BASE和G-BASE提供了高效且性能优越的成员推理攻击方法，同时揭示了RMIA的Bayes最优理论基础。

Abstract: We develop practical and theoretically grounded membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and
graph-structured data. Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of
Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for
node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions
about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and
G-BASE, computationally efficient approximations of the Bayes-optimal attack.
G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed
classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to
non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art
MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost.
Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific
hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for
the RMIA attack.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在预测LOS时表现不佳，泛化能力有限，且忽略了系统级因素。

Method: 使用澳大利亚卒中基金会急性审计数据（2015-2021），分别针对缺血性和出血性卒中开发模型，通过特征选择和集成模型提升性能。

Result: 集成模型在缺血性卒中中表现优异（AUC: 0.824），优于逻辑回归；但在出血性卒中中未显著优于逻辑回归（AUC: 0.843 vs. 0.828）。

Conclusion: 可解释的集成模型在缺血性卒中中有效预测LOS，但出血性卒中需进一步验证。

Abstract: Length of stay (LOS) prediction in acute stroke is critical for improving
care planning. Existing machine learning models have shown suboptimal
predictive performance, limited generalisability, and have overlooked
system-level factors. We aimed to enhance model efficiency, performance, and
interpretability by refining predictors and developing an interpretable
multi-level stacking ensemble model. Data were accessed from the biennial
Stroke Foundation Acute Audit (2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) in Australia. Models
were developed for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke separately. The outcome
was prolonged LOS (the LOS above the 75th percentile). Candidate predictors
(ischaemic: n=89; haemorrhagic: n=83) were categorised into patient, clinical,
and system domains. Feature selection with correlation-based approaches was
used to refine key predictors. The evaluation of models included discrimination
(AUC), calibration curves, and interpretability (SHAP plots). In ischaemic
stroke (N=12,575), prolonged LOS was >=9 days, compared to >=11 days in
haemorrhagic stroke (N=1,970). The ensemble model achieved superior performance
[AUC: 0.824 (95% CI: 0.801-0.846)] and statistically outperformed logistic
regression [AUC: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.782-0.829); P=0.0004] for ischaemic. However,
the model [AUC: 0.843 (95% CI: 0.790-0.895)] did not statistically outperform
logistic regression [AUC: 0.828 (95% CI: 0.774-0.882); P=0.136] for
haemorrhagic. SHAP analysis identified shared predictors for both types of
stroke: rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care,
inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and stroke care coordinators
involvement. An explainable ensemble model effectively predicted the prolonged
LOS in ischaemic stroke. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed for
haemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusion: 该工作首次在标准深度学习架构中实现了NFA的完整符号模拟，为自动机理论与神经计算的结合提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive framework establishing the equivalence
between nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and standard feedforward ReLU
neural networks. By encoding automaton states as binary vectors and transitions
as sparse linear layers, we show that ReLU activations simulate
nondeterministic branching, subset construction, and $\epsilon$-closures in a
mathematically precise manner. Our core theoretical results prove that a
three-layer ReLU network of width $\mathcal{O}(n)$ can exactly recognize any
regular language accepted by an $n$-state NFA-without recurrence, memory, or
approximation. Furthermore, we show that gradient descent over
structure-preserving networks preserves symbolic semantics and acceptance
behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple validation tasks-including
parallel path tracking, symbolic subset construction, $\epsilon$-closure
convergence, acceptance classification, structural training invariants, and
functional equivalence-achieve perfect or near-perfect empirical alignment with
ground-truth automata. This work provides the first provably complete symbolic
simulation of NFAs within standard deep learning architectures, uniting
automata theory with neural computation through ReLU dynamics.

Abstract: Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated
circuit (IC) industry. However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit
design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and
complexity. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer
promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design. However,
current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain,
lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model
capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we
introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance
across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis,

Abstract: Building on recent advances in scientific machine learning and generative
modeling for computational fluid dynamics, we propose a conditional score-based
diffusion model designed for multi-scenarios fluid flow prediction. Our model
integrates an energy constraint rooted in the statistical properties of
turbulent flows, improving prediction quality with minimal training, while
enabling efficient sampling at low cost. The method features a simple and
general architecture that requires no problem-specific design, supports
plug-and-play enhancements, and enables fast and flexible solution generation.
It also demonstrates an efficient conditioning mechanism that simplifies
training across different scenarios without demanding a redesign of existing
models. We further explore various stochastic differential equation
formulations to demonstrate how thoughtful design choices enhance performance.
We validate the proposed methodology through extensive experiments on complex
fluid dynamics datasets encompassing a variety of flow regimes and
configurations. Results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves
stable, robust, and physically faithful predictions, even under challenging
turbulent conditions. With properly tuned parameters, it achieves accurate
results across multiple scenarios while preserving key physical and statistical
properties. We present a comprehensive analysis of stochastic differential
equation impact and discuss our approach across diverse fluid mechanics tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RCCDA的动态模型更新策略，用于在资源受限环境下优化机器学习模型的训练动态，同时确保严格遵守预定义的资源约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中部署的机器学习模型面临概念漂移和资源约束的挑战，现有解决方案计算开销高且缺乏严格保证。

Method: 基于过去损失信息和可调漂移阈值，通过Lyapunov漂移加惩罚框架设计轻量级策略。

Result: 在三个领域泛化数据集上，RCCDA在推理准确性和资源约束方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RCCDA适用于实时机器学习部署，能有效应对概念漂移和资源限制。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are
often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the
task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more
difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict
resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection
methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained
environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or
theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose
RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while
ensuring strict compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only
past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy,
we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift
with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a
Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight policy based on a
measurable accumulated loss threshold that provably limits update frequency and
cost. Experimental results on three domain generalization datasets demonstrate
that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while
adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept
drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因选择方法忽略复杂生物通路和调控网络，导致结果不稳定且缺乏生物学意义，需结合通路知识并保持统计严谨性。

Method: 1. 通路引导的预过滤策略结合统计方法和KEGG通路信息；2. MARL框架中基因作为协作智能体，优化预测能力和生物相关性。

Result: 在多个基因表达数据集上验证，显著优于传统方法，提升预测准确性和生物学解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维基因组数据提供了一种更可靠且生物学相关的基因选择方法。

Abstract: Gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for
understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic outcomes.
Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but
often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to
unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as
Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on
individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level
interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway
knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address
this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical
selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy
that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information
for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model
genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes
both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates
pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a
reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and
pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and
a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene
expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both
prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional
methods.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖内部知识或不切实际的环境假设，且忽视了从零开始在现实环境中学习规划知识的能力，导致鲁棒性和效率不足。

Method: REPOA框架包含自适应依赖学习、细粒度失败感知操作记忆和难度探索三个关键组件。

Conclusion: REPOA为解决自主代理在开放世界中的规划问题提供了有效方案，显著提升了鲁棒性和学习效率。

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents capable of mastering complex, multi-step tasks
in unpredictable, interactive environments presents a significant challenge.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for planning, existing
approaches often rely on problematic internal knowledge or make unrealistic
environmental assumptions. Although recent work explores learning planning
knowledge, they still retain limitations due to partial reliance on external
knowledge or impractical setups. Indeed, prior research has largely overlooked
developing agents capable of acquiring planning knowledge from scratch,
directly in realistic settings. While realizing this capability is necessary,
it presents significant challenges, primarily achieving robustness given the
substantial risk of incorporating LLMs' inaccurate knowledge. Moreover,
efficiency is crucial for practicality as learning can demand prohibitive
exploration. In response, we introduce Robust and Efficient Planning for
Open-world Agents (REPOA), a novel framework designed to tackle these issues.
REPOA features three key components: adaptive dependency learning and
fine-grained failure-aware operation memory to enhance robustness to knowledge
inaccuracies, and difficulty-based exploration to improve learning efficiency.
Our evaluation in two established open-world testbeds demonstrates REPOA's
robust and efficient planning, showcasing its capability to successfully obtain
challenging late-game items that were beyond the reach of prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图中数据不满足IID条件，导致OOD问题阻碍AI泛化，需要识别不变组件以提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用信息瓶颈方法设计不变链接选择器，区分不变与可变组件，并结合任务特定损失函数优化。

Result: 实验验证了方法在推荐任务中的有效性，优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效识别时序图中的不变组件，提升模型在OOD场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, Out-of- Distribution (OOD) problems, i.e.,
the data discrepancy between the training environments and testing
environments, hinder AI generalization. Further, relational data like graphs
disobeying the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) condition makes
the problem more challenging, especially much harder when it is associated with
time. Motivated by this, to realize the robust invariant learning over temporal
graphs, we want to investigate what components in temporal graphs are most
invariant and representative with respect to labels. With the Information
Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded Invariant Link Selector
that can distinguish invariant components and variant components during the
training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different
testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable
optimization functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss
functions, e.g., temporal link prediction, to make pretrained models solve
real-world application tasks like citation recommendation and merchandise
recommendation, as demonstrated in our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/OOD-Linker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文处理中，自注意力模块因二次时间复杂度成为预填充阶段的瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力方法因粗粒度检查导致模型精度损失较大。

Method: SALE采用4位量化的查询-键乘积和块稀疏注意力，结合相对注意力分数评估重要性，并优化CUDA内核以减少额外开销。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中，SALE在Llama-3.1-8B上对超过64K的序列实现至少3.36倍加速，同时保持模型质量。

Conclusion: SALE无需参数训练，可无缝集成到现有系统中，在精度与效率的权衡上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long-context
processing, but the self-attention module becomes a bottleneck during the
prefilling stage of inference due to its quadratic time complexity with respect
to sequence length. Existing sparse attention methods accelerate attention
computation by skipping less significant regions of the attention map. However,
these approaches typically perform coarse-grained inspection of the attention
map, rendering considerable loss in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose
SALE, a fine-grained sparse attention method that accelerates the long-context
prefilling stage of LLM with negligible loss in model accuracy. SALE achieves
fast and accurate fine-grained attention weight estimation through 4-bit
quantized query-key products, followed by block-sparse attention to accelerate
prefilling computations. For importance evaluation for query-key pairs, we
adopt our Relative Attention Score metric, which offers significantly higher
efficiency within our framework. We implement a custom CUDA kernel optimized
for our approach for hardware efficiency, reducing the additional overhead to
approximately 11% of the full attention latency. Notably, SALE requires no
parameter training and can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems with
trivial code modifications. Experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs, achieving at least 3.36x speedups on Llama-3.1-8B for sequences
longer than 64K while maintaining model quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展RLVR到电子设计自动化（EDA）领域，特别是从自然语言生成硬件描述语言（Verilog），面临自动化验证环境不足、高质量NL-code对稀缺和计算成本高的挑战。

Method: 开发了基于规则的测试平台生成器、提出往返数据合成方法，并采用两阶段训练流程（蒸馏+自适应DAPO算法）。

Result: 模型CodeV-R1-7B在VerilogEval v2和RTLLM v1.1上分别达到68.6%和72.9%的pass@1，超越之前最佳性能12~20%。

Conclusion: CodeV-R1框架显著提升了Verilog生成性能，同时降低了训练成本，为EDA和LLM研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit,
automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical
problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially
automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog
from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges:
the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of
high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To
this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog
generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that
performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we
propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog
snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency
via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a
high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training
pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by
adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by
adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves
68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding
the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training
pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

TL;DR: FedDEA是一种联邦解耦聚合方法，用于多任务模型集成，通过动态识别任务相关维度并重新缩放优化效果，有效抑制跨任务干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多任务学习方法无法有效聚合异构任务到统一模型，FedDEA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FedDEA基于本地更新的响应强度动态识别任务相关维度，并通过重新缩放增强优化效果。

Result: 实验表明FedDEA能显著提升性能，适用于多种主流联邦优化算法。

Conclusion: FedDEA在高度异构任务设置下表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) enables multiple clients performing
heterogeneous tasks without exchanging their local data, offering broad
potential for privacy preserving multi-task collaboration. However, most
existing methods focus on building personalized models for each client and
unable to support the aggregation of multiple heterogeneous tasks into a
unified model. As a result, in real-world scenarios where task objectives,
label spaces, and optimization paths vary significantly, conventional FMTL
methods struggle to achieve effective joint training. To address this
challenge, we propose FedDEA (Federated Decoupled Aggregation), an
update-structure-aware aggregation method specifically designed for multi-task
model integration. Our method dynamically identifies task-relevant dimensions
based on the response strength of local updates and enhances their optimization
effectiveness through rescaling. This mechanism effectively suppresses
cross-task interference and enables task-level decoupled aggregation within a
unified global model. FedDEA does not rely on task labels or architectural
modifications, making it broadly applicable and deployment-friendly.
Experimental results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into various
mainstream federated optimization algorithms and consistently delivers
significant overall performance improvements on widely used NYUD-V2 and
PASCAL-Context. These results validate the robustness and generalization
capabilities of FedDEA under highly heterogeneous task settings.

Motivation: 随着按token成本的降低，微调SLM在现实应用中的优势（如更快推理、更低成本）可能不再明显，但本研究旨在验证SLM在特定任务中的质量优势。

Method: 通过比较微调SLM与提示LLM在生成JSON格式低代码工作流任务中的表现，评估质量差异。

Result: 研究发现，尽管良好的提示能产生合理结果，但微调SLM平均提升了10%的质量。

Conclusion: 对于需要结构化输出的领域特定任务，微调SLM仍具有显著优势，同时系统错误分析揭示了模型的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of
complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the
advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world
applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In
this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require
structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning
an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in
JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results,
fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic
error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Conclusion: 理论框架和算法有效缩小了真实与合成数据间的差距，提升了小样本分类性能。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of
labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a
promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples
often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and
synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical
framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on
supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More
importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic
samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building
upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that
integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model
training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic
data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them
across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the multi-armed bandit problem with adversarially chosen delays in
the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) framework, which aims to achieve near-optimal
performance in both stochastic and adversarial environments. While prior work
has made progress toward this goal, existing algorithms suffer from significant
gaps to the known lower bounds, especially in the stochastic settings. Our main
contribution is a new algorithm that, up to logarithmic factors, matches the
known lower bounds in each setting individually.
  In the adversarial case, our algorithm achieves regret of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + \sqrt{D})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic
terms, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, and $D$ is
the cumulative delay. In the stochastic case, we provide a regret bound which
scale as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i>0}\left(\log T/\Delta_i\right) + \frac{1}{K}\sum
\Delta_i \sigma_{max}$, where $\Delta_i$ is the sub-optimality gap of arm $i$
and $\sigma_{\max}$ is the maximum number of missing observations.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BoBW algorithm to
simultaneously match the lower bounds in both stochastic and adversarial
regimes in delayed environment. Moreover, even beyond the BoBW setting, our
stochastic regret bound is the first to match the known lower bound under
adversarial delays, improving the second term over the best known result by a
factor of $K$.

Conclusion: 揭示了MoEs关键组件的作用，并提出了改进建议。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in
modern deep learning. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical
foundations underlying their ability to model complex tasks remain poorly
understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the expressive power
of MoEs in modeling complex tasks with two common structural priors:
low-dimensionality and sparsity. For shallow MoEs, we prove that they can
efficiently approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds,
overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For deep MoEs, we show that
$\cO(L)$-layer MoEs with $E$ experts per layer can approximate piecewise
functions comprising $E^L$ pieces with compositional sparsity, i.e., they can
exhibit an exponential number of structured tasks. Our analysis reveals the
roles of critical architectural components and hyperparameters in MoEs,
including the gating mechanism, expert networks, the number of experts, and the
number of layers, and offers natural suggestions for MoE variants.

Motivation: 传统静态分析对多态和变形恶意软件无效，需动态监测行为以提升检测效果。

Method: 提取PE文件运行时API调用特征，编码为时间模式并转换为灰度图像，用CNN模型训练分类。

Result: 实验显示平均分类准确率达98.36%，且对典型规避策略具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合动态分析与深度学习的方法能高效分类恶意软件，且对抗规避能力强。

Abstract: Malware detection and classification remains a topic of concern for
cybersecurity, since it is becoming common for attackers to use advanced
obfuscation on their malware to stay undetected. Conventional static analysis
is not effective against polymorphic and metamorphic malware as these change
their appearance without modifying their behavior, thus defying the analysis by
code structure alone. This makes it important to use dynamic detection that
monitors malware behavior at runtime. In this paper, we present a dynamic
malware categorization framework that extracts API argument calls at the
runtime execution of Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Extracting and
encoding the dynamic features of API names, argument return values, and other
relative features, we convert raw behavioral data to temporal patterns. To
enhance feature portrayal, the generated patterns are subsequently converted
into grayscale pictures using a magma colormap. These improved photos are used
to teach a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model discriminative features,
which allows for reliable and accurate malware classification. Results from
experiments indicate that our method, with an average accuracy of 98.36% is
effective in classifying different classes of malware and benign by integrating
dynamic analysis and deep learning. It not only achieves high classification
accuracy but also demonstrates significant resilience against typical evasion
strategies.

Abstract: Variational inference often struggles with the posterior geometry exhibited
by complex hierarchical Bayesian models. Recent advances in flow-based
variational families and Variationally Inferred Parameters (VIP) each address
aspects of this challenge, but their formal relationship is unexplored. Here,
we prove that the combination of VIP and a full-rank Gaussian can be
represented exactly as a forward autoregressive flow augmented with a
translation term and input from the model's prior. Guided by this theoretical
insight, we introduce the Model-Informed Flow (MIF) architecture, which adds
the necessary translation mechanism, prior information, and hierarchical
ordering. Empirically, MIF delivers tighter posterior approximations and
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across a suite of hierarchical
and non-hierarchical benchmarks.

Motivation: 持续学习（CL）面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，而现有的固定全局ETF方法存在不实用和性能有限的问题。

Method: 提出ProNC框架，动态扩展ETF目标，逐步添加新任务的原型顶点，确保所有类别的最大可分性，并结合蒸馏技术平衡新旧类别的目标。

Result: 实验表明，ProNC显著优于相关基线方法，同时保持了灵活性、简单性和高效性。

Conclusion: ProNC通过动态扩展ETF目标，有效解决了持续学习中的知识干扰问题，为CL提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to build an agent that can continuously learn a
sequence of tasks, where a key challenge, namely Catastrophic Forgetting,
persists due to the potential knowledge interference among different tasks. On
the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to converge to a terminal
state termed Neural Collapse during training, where all class prototypes
geometrically form a static simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). These
maximally and equally separated class prototypes make the ETF an ideal target
for model learning in CL to mitigate knowledge interference. Thus inspired,
several studies have emerged very recently to leverage a fixed global ETF in
CL, which however suffers from key drawbacks, such as impracticability and
limited performance.To address these challenges and fully unlock the potential
of ETF in CL, we propose Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC), a novel framework
that completely removes the need of a fixed global ETF in CL. Specifically,
ProNC progressively expands the ETF target in a principled way by adding new
class prototypes as vertices for new tasks, ensuring maximal separability
across all encountered classes with minimal shifts from the previous ETF. We
next develop a new CL framework by plugging ProNC into commonly used CL
algorithm designs, where distillation is further leveraged to balance between
target shifting for old classes and target aligning for new classes. Extensive

Abstract: Data attribution methods, which quantify the influence of individual training
data points on a machine learning model, have gained increasing popularity in
data-centric applications in modern AI. Despite a recent surge of new methods
developed in this space, the impact of hyperparameter tuning in these methods
remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first large-scale
empirical study to understand the hyperparameter sensitivity of common data
attribution methods. Our results show that most methods are indeed sensitive to
certain key hyperparameters. However, unlike typical machine learning
algorithms -- whose hyperparameters can be tuned using computationally-cheap
validation metrics -- evaluating data attribution performance often requires
retraining models on subsets of training data, making such metrics
prohibitively costly for hyperparameter tuning. This poses a critical open
challenge for the practical application of data attribution methods. To address
this challenge, we advocate for better theoretical understandings of
hyperparameter behavior to inform efficient tuning strategies. As a case study,
we provide a theoretical analysis of the regularization term that is critical
in many variants of influence function methods. Building on this analysis, we
propose a lightweight procedure for selecting the regularization value without
model retraining, and validate its effectiveness across a range of standard
data attribution benchmarks. Overall, our study identifies a fundamental yet
overlooked challenge in the practical application of data attribution, and
highlights the importance of careful discussion on hyperparameter selection in
future method development.

Abstract: Model editing techniques, particularly task arithmetic using task vectors,
have shown promise in efficiently modifying pre-trained models through
arithmetic operations like task addition and negation. Despite computational
advantages, these methods may inadvertently affect model fairness, creating
risks in sensitive applications like hate speech detection. However, the
fairness implications of task arithmetic remain largely unexplored, presenting
a critical gap in the existing literature. We systematically examine how
manipulating task vectors affects fairness metrics, including Demographic
Parity and Equalized Odds. To rigorously assess these effects, we benchmark
task arithmetic against full fine-tuning, a costly but widely used baseline,
and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. Additionally, we explore merging task vectors from models fine-tuned on
demographic subgroups vulnerable to hate speech, investigating whether fairness
outcomes can be controlled by adjusting task vector coefficients, potentially
enabling tailored model behavior. Our results offer novel insights into the
fairness implications of model editing and establish a foundation for
fairness-aware and responsible model editing practices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradPower是一种轻量级的梯度变换技术，用于加速语言模型预训练，仅需单行代码修改且不影响优化器内部逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过简单的梯度变换提升语言模型预训练的效率，尤其是在混合专家模型和多样化学习率调度中表现突出。

Method: 对梯度向量进行元素级的符号幂变换（sign-power transformation），并将变换后的梯度输入基础优化器（如Adam）。

Result: 在不同架构、参数规模、数据集和学习率调度下，GradPower（如AdamPower）均能显著降低终端损失。

Conclusion: GradPower是一种高效且通用的梯度变换方法，理论分析揭示了其机制与梯度噪声的关系。

Abstract: We propose GradPower, a lightweight gradient-transformation technique for
accelerating language model pre-training. Given a gradient vector $g=(g_i)_i$,
GradPower first applies the elementwise sign-power transformation:
$\varphi_p(g)=({\rm sign}(g_i)|g_i|^p)_{i}$ for a fixed $p>0$, and then feeds
the transformed gradient into a base optimizer. Notably, GradPower requires
only a single-line code change and no modifications to the base optimizer's
internal logic, including the hyperparameters. When applied to Adam (termed
AdamPower), GradPower consistently achieves lower terminal loss across diverse
architectures (LLaMA, Qwen2MoE), parameter scales (66M to 2B), datasets (C4,
OpenWebText), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). The
most pronounced gains are observed when training modern mixture-of-experts
models with warmup-stable-decay schedules. GradPower also integrates seamlessly
with other state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Muon, yielding further
improvements. Finally, we provide theoretical analyses that reveal the
underlying mechanism of GradPower and highlights the influence of gradient
noise.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，将大型语言模型（LLM）的推理操作映射为线性系统，无需修改模型权重或改变输出预测。通过调整梯度计算，模型的雅可比矩阵几乎完全复现前向预测的线性系统。实验表明，LLM在极低维子空间中运行，且最大奇异向量与最可能输出令牌的概念相关。

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型的内部工作机制，揭示其推理过程的线性特性，从而提供对模型内部表示和语义结构的可解释性。

Method: 利用图像扩散模型中的局部线性技术，调整输入序列的梯度计算，使雅可比矩阵几乎完全复现前向预测的线性系统。实验覆盖多种LLM模型。

Result: 发现LLM在极低维子空间中运行，最大奇异向量解码为与输出令牌相关的概念。同时，逐层分析揭示了语义概念的涌现。

Conclusion: 尽管现代LLM具有强大的表达能力和全局非线性，但其推理过程可通过局部线性分解解释，揭示了内部语义结构的可解释性。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large
language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for
an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output
predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit
local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation
with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that
the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with
a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3,
Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show
through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these
LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest
singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token.
This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer
(and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and
observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and
global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact
locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal
representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token
prediction process.

Conclusion: AReaL通过异步设计和系统优化，显著提升了RL训练的效率，为大规模语言模型的强化学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a trending paradigm for training large
language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs
requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient
training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous
by alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts
in each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This
stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency.
Generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before
model update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a
\emph{fully asynchronous} RL system that completely decouples generation from
training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without
waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is
collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations,
leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training,
AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data
staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle
outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning
benchmarks show that AReaL achieves \textbf{up to 2.57$\times$ training
speedup} compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs
and matched or even improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available
at https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索弱教师模型标注的数据如何训练出强学生模型，并超越教师性能的现象。

Method: 采用广义偏差-方差分解分析W2SG，并验证反向交叉熵损失的效果。

Result: 学生模型在避免过拟合和降低预测熵时更易实现W2SG，反向交叉熵损失能提升性能。

Conclusion: W2SG现象可通过理论分析和实践策略优化，反向交叉熵损失是一个有效工具。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) refers to the phenomenon where a strong
student model, trained on a dataset labeled by a weak teacher, ultimately
outperforms the teacher on the target task. Recent studies attribute this
performance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher
models. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG
through a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence.
Specifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student
and teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While
this aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive
assumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class,
required in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge
when the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than
mimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that
if the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can
indeed converge to this posterior mean. Our analysis also suggests that
avoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of
student's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the
reverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less
sensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher. Finally, we empirically
verify our theoretical insights and demonstrate that incorporating the reverse
cross-entropy loss consistently improves student performance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了事故责任分配的准确性，并有效减少了智能体在交通事故中的责任。

Conclusion: 责任导向的奖励函数能够优化自动驾驶决策，减少违规行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in autonomous driving employs a trial-and-error
mechanism, enhancing robustness in unpredictable environments. However,
crafting effective reward functions remains challenging, as conventional
approaches rely heavily on manual design and demonstrate limited efficacy in
complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study introduces a
responsibility-oriented reward function that explicitly incorporates traffic
regulations into the RL framework. Specifically, we introduced a Traffic
Regulation Knowledge Graph and leveraged Vision-Language Models alongside
Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to automate reward assignment. This
integration guides agents to adhere strictly to traffic laws, thus minimizing
rule violations and optimizing decision-making performance in diverse driving
conditions. Experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed methodology
significantly improves the accuracy of assigning accident responsibilities and
effectively reduces the agent's liability in traffic incidents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要面向Python，无法高质量评估其他编程语言（如Swift），导致对LLM在Swift上的编码能力评估不足。

Method: 采用质量优先的方法，手工设计了28个Swift问题（SwiftEval），并评估了44个流行的Code LLM。

Result: 结果显示，LLM在需要语言特定功能的问题上得分显著下降，尤其是较小规模的模型。

Conclusion: SwiftEval填补了Swift评估基准的空白，揭示了LLM在语言特定任务上的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant
advancements in code generation. However, most evaluation benchmarks are
primarily oriented towards Python, making it difficult to evaluate other
programming languages, such as Swift, with high quality. By examining widely
established multilingual benchmarks like HumanEval-XL and MultiPL-E, we
identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them
insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift.
Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and
generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with
LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the
first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted
problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant
LLM scores drop for problems requiring language-specific features, most
noticeable in the models of smaller sizes.

Abstract: Hyperbolic deep learning leverages the metric properties of hyperbolic spaces
to develop efficient and informative embeddings of hierarchical data. Here, we
focus on the solvable group structure of hyperbolic spaces, which follows
naturally from their construction as symmetric spaces. This dual nature of Lie
group and Riemannian manifold allows us to propose a new class of hyperbolic
deep learning algorithms where group homomorphisms are interleaved with
metric-preserving diffeomorphisms. The resulting algorithms, which we call
Cartan networks, show promising results on various benchmark data sets and open
the way to a novel class of hyperbolic deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: ReCalKV是一种后训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过针对Keys和Values的不同策略，实现高效的长上下文推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文推理中因KV缓存的内存需求过高而受限，现有方法在高压缩比下性能下降或引入额外计算。

Method: ReCalKV采用Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR)压缩Keys，通过分组SVD减少计算；对Values采用Offline Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF)保持准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ReCalKV在高压缩比下性能损失最小，优于现有低秩压缩方法。

Conclusion: ReCalKV为高效长上下文推理提供了一种有效的KV缓存压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance, yet their
capability on long-context reasoning is often constrained by the excessive
memory required to store the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache
compression an essential step toward enabling efficient long-context reasoning.
Recent methods have explored reducing the hidden dimensions of the KV cache,
but many introduce additional computation through projection layers or suffer
from significant performance degradation under high compression ratios. To
address these challenges, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training KV cache
compression method that reduces the hidden dimensions of the KV cache. We
develop distinct compression strategies for Keys and Values based on their
different roles and varying importance in the attention mechanism. For Keys, we
propose Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters similar
heads and applies grouped SVD to the key projection matrix, reducing additional
computation while preserving accuracy. For Values, we propose Offline
Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF) to preserve accuracy without extra
computational overhead. Experiments show that ReCalKV outperforms existing
low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal
performance loss. Code is available at:

Result: SAEs能准确重建残差流嵌入，并在可解释性上优于MLP神经元；ITDA与SAEs的可解释性相当。

Conclusion: SAEs和ITDA在大型扩散模型中表现出良好的激活分解能力，可用于图像生成的引导控制。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language
model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied
successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion
models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently
proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set
of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with
gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large
text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of
embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline.
We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat
MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image
generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable
interpretability to SAEs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified approach to cluster refinement and anomaly
detection in datasets. We propose a novel algorithm that iteratively reduces
the intra-cluster variance of N clusters until a global minimum is reached,
yielding tighter clusters than the standard k-means algorithm. We evaluate the
method using intrinsic measures for unsupervised learning, including the
silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index, and
extend it to anomaly detection by identifying points whose assignment causes a
significant variance increase. External validation on synthetic data and the
UCI Breast Cancer and UCI Wine Quality datasets employs the Jaccard similarity
score, V-measure, and F1 score. Results show variance reductions of 18.7% and

TL;DR: 论文提出Adversarial Preference Learning (APL)，通过迭代对抗训练解决RLHF在语言模型中的局限性，显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型依赖RLHF确保安全行为，但仍面临人工标注成本高、对抗攻击多样性和反馈偏见等问题。

Method: APL引入三个创新：基于模型内在偏好的直接有害性度量、条件生成对抗攻击器、自动化闭环反馈的迭代框架。

Result: 实验显示APL显著提升模型鲁棒性，有害输出减少至0.43%，攻击成功率降低65%，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: APL有效解决了RLHF的局限性，为语言模型的安全性和鲁棒性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modern language models often rely on Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) to encourage safe behaviors. However, they remain vulnerable to
adversarial attacks due to three key limitations: (1) the inefficiency and high
cost of human annotation, (2) the vast diversity of potential adversarial
attacks, and (3) the risk of feedback bias and reward hacking. To address these
challenges, we introduce Adversarial Preference Learning (APL), an iterative
adversarial training method incorporating three key innovations. First, a
direct harmfulness metric based on the model's intrinsic preference
probabilities, eliminating reliance on external assessment. Second, a
conditional generative attacker that synthesizes input-specific adversarial
variations. Third, an iterative framework with automated closed-loop feedback,
enabling continuous adaptation through vulnerability discovery and mitigation.
Experiments on Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 demonstrate that APL significantly
enhances robustness, achieving 83.33% harmlessness win rate over the base model
(evaluated by GPT-4o), reducing harmful outputs from 5.88% to 0.43% (measured
by LLaMA-Guard), and lowering attack success rate by up to 65% according to
HarmBench. Notably, APL maintains competitive utility, with an MT-Bench score
of 6.59 (comparable to the baseline 6.78) and an LC-WinRate of 46.52% against
the base model.

Result: M3DT在任务数量增加时表现优异，成功扩展到160个任务。

Conclusion: M3DT通过MoE和优化训练机制，显著提升了多任务强化学习的任务扩展能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in offline multi-task reinforcement learning
(MTRL) have harnessed the powerful capabilities of the Transformer
architecture, most approaches focus on a limited number of tasks, with scaling
to extremely massive tasks remaining a formidable challenge. In this paper, we
first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and
further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to
counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates.
Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE)
framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's
parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the
optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT)
backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a
three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal
performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of
experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion
on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability,
successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.

Result: 攻击方法在多个基准测试中显著提高了数据提取成功率，并在模拟医疗数据集上验证了其现实风险。

Conclusion: 精确遗忘可能增加隐私泄露风险，建议评估遗忘方法时考虑更广泛的威胁模型。

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on datasets collected from the
web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information.
To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to
remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact
unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data --
is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against
privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by
introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact
unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by
guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model,
we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model
guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves
extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common
benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our
attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight
real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our
findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase
the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods
to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning
models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

*Yifei Cheng,Li Shen,Hao Sun,Nan Yin,Xiaochun Cao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LightSAM改进SAM优化器，通过自适应调整扰动半径和学习率，减少对参数的敏感性，扩展了SAM的应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM优化器虽能提升模型泛化能力，但对扰动半径和学习率敏感，需手动调参，限制了其实际应用。

Method: LightSAM使用AdaGrad-Norm、AdaGrad和Adam等自适应优化器替代SGD，自动调整扰动半径和学习率。

Result: 理论证明LightSAM在弱假设下可理想收敛，实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: LightSAM实现了参数无关性，扩展了SAM的实用性。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer enhances the generalization
ability of the machine learning model by exploring the flat minima landscape
through weight perturbations. Despite its empirical success, SAM introduces an
additional hyper-parameter, the perturbation radius, which causes the
sensitivity of SAM to it. Moreover, it has been proved that the perturbation
radius and learning rate of SAM are constrained by problem-dependent parameters
to guarantee convergence. These limitations indicate the requirement of
parameter-tuning in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the
algorithm LightSAM which sets the perturbation radius and learning rate of SAM
adaptively, thus extending the application scope of SAM. LightSAM employs three
popular adaptive optimizers, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad and Adam, to
replace the SGD optimizer for weight perturbation and model updating, reducing
sensitivity to parameters. Theoretical results show that under weak
assumptions, LightSAM could converge ideally with any choices of perturbation
radius and learning rate, thus achieving parameter-agnostic. We conduct
preliminary experiments on several deep learning tasks, which together with the
theoretical findings validate the the effectiveness of LightSAM.

Method: 分析三种距离函数下聚合函数的Lipschitz连续性，计算其常数，并推导网络Lipschitz常数的上界。

Result: 每种聚合函数仅对一种距离函数Lipschitz连续，理论分析通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 为多集合数据神经网络的Lipschitz常数提供了理论支持，并验证了其稳定性和泛化性。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important
properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus
useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior
work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as
sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data.
These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function,
such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a
single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether
these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three
distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz
constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is
Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions.
Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz
constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we
also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under
distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct
a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两步学习策略，用于解决多任务学习中的异质性问题，通过共享表示和任务特定组件的分离，提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）在多个领域应用广泛，但现有方法难以同时处理多种异质性形式。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两步策略：首先利用共享表示填补缺失块，然后将输入特征与响应的映射分解为共享和任务特定组件。

Result: 数值实验和ADNI数据库的真实数据分析表明，该方法在多任务学习中表现优于其他竞争方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两步策略有效解决了MTL中的异质性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as an imperative machine learning tool
to solve multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been successfully
applied to healthcare, marketing, and biomedical fields. However, in order to
borrow information across different tasks effectively, it is essential to
utilize both homogeneous and heterogeneous information. Among the extensive
literature on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity are presented in MTL
problems, such as block-wise, distribution, and posterior heterogeneity.
Existing methods, however, struggle to tackle these forms of heterogeneity
simultaneously in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a two-step
learning strategy for MTL which addresses the aforementioned heterogeneity.
First, we impute the missing blocks using shared representations extracted from
homogeneous source across different tasks. Next, we disentangle the mappings
between input features and responses into a shared component and a
task-specific component, respectively, thereby enabling information borrowing
through the shared component. Our numerical experiments and real-data analysis
from the ADNI database demonstrate the superior MTL performance of the proposed
method compared to other competing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于肌肉骨骼模拟和运动轨迹修改的数据增强方法，用于改善IMU数据的深度学习方法，解决了数据不足、类别不平衡和标签模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估运动质量对物理治疗和运动训练有重要意义，但IMU数据有限、类别不平衡和标签模糊限制了深度学习模型的效果。

Method: 通过肌肉骨骼模拟生成真实的IMU数据，结合运动轨迹的系统修改，确保生物力学合理性，并利用逆向运动学参数和知识评估策略实现自动可靠标注。

Result: 实验表明，增强数据与真实数据高度相似，显著提高了神经网络模型的分类准确性和泛化能力，尤其适用于患者特定场景。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度学习在物理治疗运动评估中的常见挑战，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of movement quality holds significant potential for
enhancing physiotherapeutic treatments and sports training by providing
objective, real-time feedback. However, the effectiveness of deep learning
models in assessing movements captured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) is
often hampered by limited data availability, class imbalance, and label
ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel data augmentation method that
generates realistic IMU data using musculoskeletal simulations integrated with
systematic modifications of movement trajectories. Crucially, our approach
ensures biomechanical plausibility and allows for automatic, reliable labeling
by combining inverse kinematic parameters with a knowledge-based evaluation
strategy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that augmented variants closely
resembles real-world data, significantly improving the classification accuracy
and generalization capability of neural network models. Additionally, we
highlight the benefits of augmented data for patient-specific fine-tuning
scenarios, particularly when only limited subject-specific training examples
are available. Our findings underline the practicality and efficacy of this
augmentation method in overcoming common challenges faced by deep learning
applications in physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation.

TL;DR: CLIC是一种基于多图像和相关标题的新型微调方法，旨在提升CLIP模型的组合推理能力，同时改善检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在组合推理方面表现不佳，且改进组合性的尝试往往忽视了语义理解，甚至导致检索性能下降。

Method: 提出CLIC方法，通过结合多图像及其相关标题进行微调，提升模型的组合推理能力。

Result: CLIC显著提升了不同架构和预训练CLIP模型的组合性（包括词汇和语义理解），并在检索性能上取得一致提升。

Conclusion: CLIC是当前SugarCrepe++基准上表现最佳的组合性CLIP模型，且代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often
struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the
relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that
previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical
sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream
retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that
improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce
CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a
novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated
captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as
differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic
understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This
even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance.
Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in
retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our
models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io

*Md Shahriar Rahim Siddiqui,Moshe Eliasof,Eldad Haber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Graph Flow Matching (GFM)的方法，通过引入图神经网络模块增强流匹配模型，利用邻域信息提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配方法独立预测每个点的速度，忽略了邻域点之间的相关性，可能影响生成质量。

Method: GFM将学习到的速度分解为反应项（标准流匹配网络）和扩散项（通过图神经网络聚合邻域信息），以低成本增强预测。

Result: 在多个图像生成基准测试中，GFM显著提升了FID和recall指标。

Conclusion: GFM是一种轻量级且有效的模块化增强方法，适用于现有流匹配架构。

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity
field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically
predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and
time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this
pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the
generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby
improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow
Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity
into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion
term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This
reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models
while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal
additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained
variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance
(FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN
Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its
effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

Motivation: 现有时间图神经网络（TGNNs）往往忽略了时间箭头对因果拓扑的影响，缺乏一个能完整捕捉时间图因果结构的同构定义。

Method: 提出了consistent event graph isomorphism概念，利用时间展开表示时间路径，并开发了时间版本的Weisfeiler-Leman算法和基于事件图的消息传递方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在时间图分类任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的同构定义和消息传递方案，论文提升了TGNNs对时间图因果结构的建模能力。

Abstract: An important characteristic of temporal graphs is how the directed arrow of
time influences their causal topology, i.e., which nodes can possibly influence
each other causally via time-respecting paths. The resulting patterns are often
neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the
expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to
temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap,
we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a
time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We
compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms.
We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a
temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically
distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural
networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An
experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal
graph classification experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽强大，但存在输出有害内容和易受对抗攻击的安全风险，需要一种不修改模型权重的方法来确保安全性。

Method: 提出SaP框架，通过多面体的面识别安全与不安全区域，利用几何引导检测和纠正不安全输出。

Result: 实验表明，SaP能有效检测不道德输入，降低对抗攻击成功率，同时保持标准任务性能。

Conclusion: SaP展示了在LLM表示空间中显式建模安全性的重要性，并为安全性的捕获提供了可解释的几何视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools but pose
significant safety risks through harmful outputs and vulnerability to
adversarial attacks. We propose SaP, short for Safety Polytope, a geometric
approach to LLM safety that learns and enforces multiple safety constraints
directly in the model's representation space. We develop a framework that
identifies safe and unsafe regions via the polytope's facets, enabling both
detection and correction of unsafe outputs through geometric steering. Unlike
existing approaches that modify model weights, SaP operates post-hoc in the
representation space, preserving model capabilities while enforcing safety
constraints. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that our method can
effectively detect unethical inputs, reduce adversarial attack success rates
while maintaining performance on standard tasks, thus highlighting the
importance of having an explicit geometric model for safety. Analysis of the
learned polytope facets reveals emergence of specialization in detecting
different semantic notions of safety, providing interpretable insights into how
safety is captured in LLMs' representation space.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于理论基础的统一预算感知（UBA）学习率调度方法，显著优于常见调度方法，适用于多种架构和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算成本增加和资源有限，需要高效的预算迭代训练方法，而现有学习率调度设计缺乏理论基础且效率低下。

Method: 构建了预算感知优化框架，推导出UBA调度，通过单一超参数φ平衡灵活性与简单性，无需逐网络优化。

Result: UBA在不同架构和任务中均优于常见调度方法，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: UBA为预算迭代训练提供了高效且理论支持的学习率调度方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the
critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal
learning within predetermined iteration budgets.While learning rate schedules
fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks,
particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely
heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations.In addition, the optimal learning
rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training
process inefficient.In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA)
schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently
outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under
different constrained training budgets.First, we bridge the gap by constructing
a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts
for the robustness to landscape curvature variations.From this framework, we
derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter $\varphi$ that
provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need
for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical
connection between $\varphi$ and the condition number, adding interpretation
and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for
different values of $\varphi$.We offer practical guidelines for its selection
via theoretical analysis and empirical results.xtensive experimental results
show that UBA \textit{consistently surpasses} the commonly-used schedules
across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g.,
ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于识别的方法倾向于学习捷径而非全面表示，而重建方法能更好地学习ID数据的内在分布。

Method: 采用Masked Image Modeling作为前置任务，构建MOOD框架。

Result: MOOD在单类、多类和近分布OOD检测中分别提升5.7%、3.0%和2.1%，甚至优于10-shot-per-class的异常暴露方法。

Conclusion: 重建方法为OOD检测提供了通用且高效的先验，MOOD框架表现出色。

Abstract: The core of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to learn the
in-distribution (ID) representation, which is distinguishable from OOD samples.
Previous work applied recognition-based methods to learn the ID features, which
tend to learn shortcuts instead of comprehensive representations. In this work,
we find surprisingly that simply using reconstruction-based methods could boost
the performance of OOD detection significantly. We deeply explore the main
contributors of OOD detection and find that reconstruction-based pretext tasks
have the potential to provide a generally applicable and efficacious prior,
which benefits the model in learning intrinsic data distributions of the ID
dataset. Specifically, we take Masked Image Modeling as a pretext task for our
OOD detection framework (MOOD). Without bells and whistles, MOOD outperforms
previous SOTA of one-class OOD detection by 5.7%, multi-class OOD detection by
3.0%, and near-distribution OOD detection by 2.1%. It even defeats the
10-shot-per-class outlier exposure OOD detection, although we do not include
any OOD samples for our detection. Codes are available at

Motivation: 压缩和剪枝大型机器学习模型是实际应用中的关键步骤，但现有方法未考虑权重结构，限制了效果。

Conclusion: 结构化平滑和SVD压缩方法实现了高效模型压缩，无需微调即可达到先进性能。

Abstract: Compressing and pruning large machine learning models has become a critical
step towards their deployment in real-world applications. Standard pruning and
compression techniques are typically designed without taking the structure of
the network's weights into account, limiting their effectiveness. We explore
the impact of smooth regularization on neural network training and model
compression. By applying nuclear norm, first- and second-order derivative
penalties of the weights during training, we encourage structured smoothness
while preserving predictive performance on par with non-smooth models. We find
that standard pruning methods often perform better when applied to these smooth
models. Building on this observation, we apply a
Singular-Value-Decomposition-based compression method that exploits the
underlying smooth structure and approximates the model's weight tensors by
smaller low-rank tensors. Our approach enables state-of-the-art compression
without any fine-tuning - reaching up to $91\%$ accuracy on a smooth ResNet-18
on CIFAR-10 with $70\%$ fewer parameters.

Motivation: 传统SAE因固定稀疏级别需训练多个模型，增加了计算负担。研究旨在通过单一模型满足不同稀疏需求，同时保持高解释性。

Method: 引入HierarchicalTopK训练目标，使SAE能同时优化多个稀疏级别的重构。

Result: 在Gemma-2 2B上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏性与解释方差间实现了帕累托最优，且在高稀疏性下仍保持高解释性。

Conclusion: HierarchicalTopK填补了SAE设计中灵活性与解释性之间的重要空白。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting
neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled,
interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are
constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting
different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases
the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a
novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to
optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously.
Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance,
outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further
analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores
even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap
between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

Method: 引入OCB框架，结合CBMs和对象中心基础模型，通过对象概念编码聚合策略提升性能。

Result: OCB在复杂图像数据集上表现优于传统CBMs，并能支持复杂视觉任务的可解释决策。

Conclusion: OCB框架通过结合对象中心模型和概念瓶颈模型，显著提升了复杂任务的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical
challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by
extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image
encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept
activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on
holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric
real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision
tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines
the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models,
boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image
datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components
of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings.
The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make
interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

increasing latency by 1 hop size allows us to further halve the cost of the
neural inference step. Thirdly, we we observe that the least squares problem
features a tridiagonal matrix and propose a linear-complexity solver for the
least squares step that leverages tridiagonality and positive-semidefiniteness,
achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We release samples online.

Abstract: The Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem plays a crucial role in
power system operations, ensuring voltage stability and minimizing power
losses. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly within the ``learning
to optimize'' framework, have enabled fast and efficient approximations of ORPD
solutions, typically by training models on precomputed optimization results.
While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance on synthetic
datasets, their effectiveness under real-world grid conditions remains largely
unexplored. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a
publicly available power system dataset that includes both the structural
characteristics of Uruguay's electrical grid and nearly two years of real-world
operational data, encompassing actual demand and generation profiles. Given
Uruguay's high penetration of renewable energy, the ORPD problem has become the
primary optimization challenge in its power network. Second, we assess the
impact of real-world data on learning-based ORPD solutions, revealing a
significant increase in prediction errors when transitioning from synthetic to
actual demand and generation inputs. Our results highlight the limitations of
existing models in learning under the complex statistical properties of real
grid conditions and emphasize the need for more expressive architectures. By
providing this dataset, we aim to facilitate further research into robust
learning-based optimization techniques for power system management.

spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning
and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods
often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct
value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and
contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g.,
ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning
capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing
TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can
slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time
series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this
paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates
TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies
to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and
evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal
that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities,
especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While
preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors
of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations.
We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting
paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF
frameworks.

Abstract: Deep Learning, driven by neural networks, has led to groundbreaking
advancements in Artificial Intelligence by enabling systems to learn and adapt
like the human brain. These models have achieved remarkable results,
particularly in data-intensive domains, supported by massive computational
infrastructure. However, deploying such systems in Aerospace, where real time

Neural Network a distributed architecture where multiple airborne devices each
host a subset of neural network neurons. These devices compute collaboratively,
guided by an airborne network controller and layer specific controllers,
enabling real-time learning and inference during flight. This approach has the
potential to revolutionize Aerospace applications, including airborne air
traffic control, real-time weather and geographical predictions, and dynamic
geospatial data processing. By enabling large-scale neural network operations
in airborne environments, this work lays the foundation for the next generation

Method: 研究采用基于softmax的非线性注意力机制，分析Transformer在双曲空间中的OLS回归性能，推导出误差上界及收敛速率。

Conclusion: Transformer在非欧几里得数据分布下具有稳健的回归能力，为理论研究和实际应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their central role in the success of foundational models and
large-scale language modeling, the theoretical foundations governing the
operation of Transformers remain only partially understood. Contemporary
research has largely focused on their representational capacity for language
comprehension and their prowess in in-context learning, frequently under
idealized assumptions such as linearized attention mechanisms. Initially
conceived to model sequence-to-sequence transformations, a fundamental and
unresolved question is whether Transformers can robustly perform functional
regression over sequences of input tokens. This question assumes heightened
importance given the inherently non-Euclidean geometry underlying real-world
data distributions. In this work, we establish that Transformers equipped with
softmax-based nonlinear attention are uniformly consistent when tasked with
executing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, provided both the inputs and
outputs are embedded in hyperbolic space. We derive deterministic upper bounds
on the empirical error which, in the asymptotic regime, decay at a provable
rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2d})$, where $t$ denotes the number of input tokens
and $d$ the embedding dimensionality. Notably, our analysis subsumes the
Euclidean setting as a special case, recovering analogous convergence
guarantees parameterized by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
These theoretical insights are corroborated through empirical evaluations on
real-world datasets involving both continuous and categorical response
variables.

Conclusion: 该框架为信号处理和数据分析提供了系统化的工具，扩展了经典变换的应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework consisting of a class of algebraic structures
that generalize one-dimensional monoidal systems into higher dimensions by
defining per-axis composition operators subject to non-commutativity and a
global interchange law. These structures, defined recursively from a base case
of vector-matrix pairs, model directional composition in multiple dimensions
while preserving structural coherence through commutative linear operators.
  We show that the framework that unifies several well-known linear transforms
in signal processing and data analysis. In this framework, data indices are
embedded into a composite structure that decomposes into simpler components. We
show that classic transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the
Walsh transform, and the Hadamard transform are special cases of our algebraic
structure. The framework provides a systematic way to derive these transforms
by appropriately choosing vector and matrix pairs. By subsuming classical
transforms within a common structure, the framework also enables the
development of learnable transformations tailored to specific data modalities
and tasks.

Motivation: 传统图异常检测方法难以捕捉高阶交互的变化，而这些变化对识别复杂结构异常至关重要。

Method: 利用单纯复形的Hodge Laplacian的谱特性建模数据点间的多向交互，并结合更高维的单纯结构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，HLSAD在检测事件和变化点方面优于现有图方法。

Conclusion: HLSAD通过引入高阶交互建模，显著提升了异常检测的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HLSAD, a novel method for detecting anomalies in
time-evolving simplicial complexes. While traditional graph anomaly detection
techniques have been extensively studied, they often fail to capture changes in
higher-order interactions that are crucial for identifying complex structural
anomalies. These higher-order interactions can arise either directly from the
underlying data itself or through graph lifting techniques. Our approach
leverages the spectral properties of Hodge Laplacians of simplicial complexes
to effectively model multi-way interactions among data points. By incorporating
higher-dimensional simplicial structures into our method, our method enhances
both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Through comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing graph methods in detecting both events and change
points.

TL;DR: K-Steering是一种通过训练非线性多标签分类器来控制LLM行为的方法，避免了线性假设，无需存储和调整单独属性向量，并能动态组合行为。


<details>

Motivation: 由于行为属性间的干扰和线性方法的局限性，控制LLM的多行为属性具有挑战性。

Method: 训练一个非线性多标签分类器，通过梯度计算干预方向，避免线性假设和单独调整属性向量。

Result: 在ToneBank和DebateMix基准测试中，K-Steering在准确控制多行为方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: K-Steering提供了一种统一且灵活的方法，有效解决了LLM多行为控制的挑战。

Abstract: Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at
inference time is a challenging problem due to interference between attributes
and the limitations of linear steering methods, which assume additive behavior
in activation space and require per-attribute tuning. We introduce K-Steering,
a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label
classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via
gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the
need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic
composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose
two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral
control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both
activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering
outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.

Abstract: Complex piezoelectric systems are foundational in industrial applications.
Their performance, however, is challenged by the nonlinear voltage-displacement
hysteretic relationships. Efficient characterization methods are, therefore,
essential for reliable design, monitoring, and maintenance. Recently proposed
neural operator methods serve as surrogates for system characterization but
face two pressing issues: interpretability and generalizability.
State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural operators are black-boxes, providing little
insight into the learned operator. Additionally, generalizing them to novel
voltages and predicting displacement profiles beyond the training domain is
challenging, limiting their practical use. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a neuro-symbolic operator (NSO) framework that derives the
analytical operators governing hysteretic relationships. NSO first learns a
Fourier neural operator mapping voltage fields to displacement profiles,
followed by a library-based sparse model discovery method, generating white-box
parsimonious models governing the underlying hysteresis. These models enable
accurate and interpretable prediction of displacement profiles across varying
and out-of-distribution voltage fields, facilitating generalizability. The
potential of NSO is demonstrated by accurately predicting voltage-displacement
hysteresis, including butterfly-shaped relationships. Moreover, NSO predicts
displacement profiles even for noisy and low-fidelity voltage data, emphasizing
its robustness. The results highlight the advantages of NSO compared to SOTA
neural operators and model discovery methods on several evaluation metrics.
Consequently, NSO contributes to characterizing complex piezoelectric systems
while improving the interpretability and generalizability of neural operators,
essential for design, monitoring, maintenance, and other real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应校正方法，确保傅里叶神经算子（FNO）的输出严格满足守恒定律，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准FNO无法严格保持守恒定律（如质量、动量守恒），现有方法虽尝试解决但效果不佳。

Method: 引入可学习矩阵，自适应调整输出以满足守恒定律，确保严格满足且不牺牲性能。

Result: 理论证明该方法优于传统FNO，实验显示在多种PDE中表现更优。

Conclusion: 自适应校正方法在保持守恒定律的同时提升了FNO的性能，具有灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have recently emerged as a promising and
efficient approach for learning the numerical solutions to partial differential
equations (PDEs) from data. However, standard FNO often fails to preserve key
conservation laws, such as mass conservation, momentum conservation, norm
conservation, etc., which are crucial for accurately modeling physical systems.
Existing methods for incorporating these conservation laws into Fourier neural
operators are achieved by designing related loss function or incorporating
post-processing method at the training time. None of them can both exactly and
adaptively correct the outputs to satisfy conservation laws, and our
experiments show that these methods can lead to inferior performance while
preserving conservation laws. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive
correction approach to ensure the conservation of fundamental quantities. Our
method introduces a learnable matrix to adaptively adjust the solution to
satisfy the conservation law during training. It ensures that the outputs
exactly satisfy the goal conservation law and allow for more flexibility and
adaptivity for the model to correct the outputs. We theoretically show that
applying our adaptive correction to an unconstrained FNO yields a solution with
data loss no worse than that of the best conservation-satisfying FNO. We
compare our approach with existing methods on a range of representative PDEs.
Experiment results show that our method consistently outperform other methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel
chemicals and materials; however, transitioning these discoveries to
industrial-scale production remains a critical bottleneck, as it requires the
development of entirely new chemical manufacturing processes. Current AI
methods cannot auto-generate PFDs or PIDs, despite their critical role in
scaling chemical processes, while adhering to engineering constraints. We
present a closed loop, physics aware framework for the automated generation of
industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates domain specialized
small scale language models (SLMs) (trained for chemical process QA tasks) with
first principles simulation, leveraging three key components: (1) a
hierarchical knowledge graph of process flow and instrumentation descriptions
for 1,020+ chemicals, (2) a multi-stage training pipeline that fine tunes
domain specialized SLMs on synthetic datasets via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Retrieval-Augmented Instruction
Tuning (RAIT), and (3) DWSIM based simulator in the loop validation to ensure
feasibility. To improve both runtime efficiency and model compactness, the
framework incorporates advanced inference time optimizations including
FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization,
and Test Time Inference Scaling and independently applies structural pruning
techniques (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce model
size with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments demonstrate that the framework
generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity,
outperforms baseline methods in correctness, and generalizes to unseen
chemicals. By bridging AI-driven design with industrial-scale feasibility, this
work significantly reduces R&D timelines from lab discovery to plant
deployment.

Abstract: Model robustness indicates a model's capability to generalize well on
unforeseen distributional shifts, including data corruption, adversarial
attacks, and domain shifts. Data augmentation is one of the prevalent and
effective ways to enhance robustness. Despite the great success of
augmentations in different fields, a general theoretical understanding of their
efficacy in improving model robustness is lacking. We offer a unified
theoretical framework to clarify how augmentations can enhance model robustness
through the lens of loss surface flatness and PAC generalization bound. Our
work diverges from prior studies in that our analysis i) broadly encompasses
much of the existing augmentation methods, and ii) is not limited to specific
types of distribution shifts like adversarial attacks. We confirm our theories
through simulations on the existing common corruption and adversarial
robustness benchmarks based on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, as well as
domain generalization benchmarks including PACS and OfficeHome.

Result: 在基准预测数据集上的实验表明，该方法在点和概率预测中优于广泛使用的方法，同时参数更少、训练更快。

Conclusion: BCE方法通过保留顺序信息，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating
regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space
into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit
from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with
modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on
one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying
values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative
distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we
propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding
(BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This
encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the
model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a
classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network
architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated
convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach
outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting,
while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.

Abstract: Gaussian sketching, which consists of pre-multiplying the data with a random
Gaussian matrix, is a widely used technique for multiple problems in data
science and machine learning, with applications spanning computationally
efficient optimization, coded computing, and federated learning. This operation
also provides differential privacy guarantees due to its inherent randomness.
In this work, we revisit this operation through the lens of Renyi Differential
Privacy (RDP), providing a refined privacy analysis that yields significantly
tighter bounds than prior results. We then demonstrate how this improved
analysis leads to performance improvement in different linear regression
settings, establishing theoretical utility guarantees. Empirically, our methods
improve performance across multiple datasets and, in several cases, reduce
runtime.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了解释质量指标的冲突问题，提升了解释模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Explainability is crucial for improving the transparency of black-box machine
learning models. With the advancement of explanation methods such as LIME and
SHAP, various XAI performance metrics have been developed to evaluate the
quality of explanations. However, different explainers can provide contrasting
explanations for the same prediction, introducing trade-offs across conflicting
quality metrics. Although available aggregation approaches improve robustness,
reducing explanations' variability, very limited research employed a
multi-criteria decision-making approach. To address this gap, this paper
introduces a multi-criteria rank-based weighted aggregation method that
balances multiple quality metrics simultaneously to produce an ensemble of
explanation models. Furthermore, we propose rank-based versions of existing XAI
metrics (complexity, faithfulness and stability) to better evaluate ranked
feature importance explanations. Extensive experiments on publicly available
datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model across these metrics.
Comparative analyses of various multi-criteria decision-making and rank
aggregation algorithms showed that TOPSIS and WSUM are the best candidates for
this use case.

Result: HDD显著提高了训练稳定性，仅需20%的蒸馏核心集即可保持模型性能，并与现有分布匹配方法兼容。

Conclusion: HDD通过双曲空间建模层次结构，为数据集蒸馏提供了一种高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale
datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize
a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model
performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level
optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning
the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested
optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a
promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean
space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,
overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed
HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential
volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like
structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz
hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is
measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By
optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated
into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards
the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving
their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning
in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model
performance, while significantly improving training stability. Notably, HDD is
seamlessly compatible with most existing DM methods, and extensive experiments
on different datasets validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 新方法提升了NCO在约束紧密度变化下的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising
problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most
existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint
value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the
performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle
routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance
under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis
reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can
only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but
poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we
develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees
of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally
adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method
can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior
performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various
constraint tightness degrees.

Abstract: Penalties are fraught and game-changing moments in soccer games that teams
explicitly prepare for. Consequently, there has been substantial interest in
analyzing them in order to provide advice to practitioners. From a data science
perspective, such analyses suffer from a significant limitation: they make the
unrealistic simplifying assumption that goalkeepers and takers select their
action -- where to dive and where to the place the kick -- independently of
each other. In reality, the choices that some goalkeepers make depend on the
taker's movements and vice-versa. This adds substantial complexity to the
problem because not all players have the same action capacities, that is, only
some players are capable of basing their decisions on their opponent's
movements. However, the small sample sizes on the player level mean that one
may have limited insights into a specific opponent's capacities. We address
these challenges by developing a player-agnostic simulation framework that can

set of choices and incorporates information about a goalkeeper's skills. Our
work is grounded in a large dataset of penalties that were annotated by penalty

*Masahiro Negishi,Thomas Gärtner,Pascal Welke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了消息传递神经网络（MPNNs）在特定任务中学习的距离函数，提出了一种可解释的图距离方法，通过实验验证了MPNNs关注功能重要子图的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究将MPNNs的距离与图的结构距离关联，忽略了任务特定信息。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究MPNNs隐含学习的功能距离。

Method: 通过最优传输在Weisfeiler Leman标记树（WILT）上提取MPNN嵌入的距离，边权重揭示了影响嵌入距离的关键子图。

Result: 实验表明，MPNNs通过关注功能重要的子图来定义嵌入的相对位置，方法可线性时间计算，并推广了两个著名图核。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的图距离，揭示了MPNNs在任务中学习的功能距离机制。

Abstract: We investigate the distance function learned by message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) in specific tasks, aiming to capture the functional distance
between prediction targets that MPNNs implicitly learn. This contrasts with
previous work, which links MPNN distances on arbitrary tasks to structural
distances on graphs that ignore task-specific information. To address this gap,
we distill the distance between MPNN embeddings into an interpretable graph
distance. Our method uses optimal transport on the Weisfeiler Leman Labeling
Tree (WILT), where the edge weights reveal subgraphs that strongly influence
the distance between embeddings. This approach generalizes two well-known graph
kernels and can be computed in linear time. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that MPNNs define the relative position of embeddings by focusing
on a small set of subgraphs that are known to be functionally important in the
domain.

### [310] [Learning Distributions over Permutations and Rankings with Factorized Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24664)
*Daniel Severo,Brian Karrer,Niklas Nolte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于排列的替代表示方法（如Lehmer码、Fisher-Yates抽样和插入向量）的新方法，用于学习排列上的分布，避免了昂贵的变分推理，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排列分布在机器学习中应用广泛，但现有方法依赖参数化混合或昂贵的变分推理，需要更高效且表达能力强的解决方案。

Method: 利用排列的替代表示（如Lehmer码）与对称群形成双射，从而可以使用常规深度学习技术进行无约束学习，并能表示任意排列概率分布。

Result: 在拼图任务中显著优于现有方法，并提出了两个新基准（循环排列和电影重排序），展示了即使在表达能力最低的模式下也能学习非平凡分布。

Conclusion: 新方法在表达能力和计算效率之间实现了平衡，能够覆盖传统模型（如Mallow's模型），并在复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning distributions over permutations is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with applications in ranking, combinatorial optimization, structured
prediction, and data association. Existing methods rely on mixtures of
parametric families or neural networks with expensive variational inference
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages
alternative representations for permutations, including Lehmer codes,
Fisher-Yates draws, and Insertion-Vectors. These representations form a
bijection with the symmetric group, allowing for unconstrained learning using
conventional deep learning techniques, and can represent any probability
distribution over permutations. Our approach enables a trade-off between
expressivity of the model family and computational requirements. In the least
expressive and most computationally efficient case, our method subsumes
previous families of well established probabilistic models over permutations,
including Mallow's and the Repeated Insertion Model. Experiments indicate our
method significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle
benchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this
benchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability
distributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct
solution exists). We therefore propose two additional benchmarks: learning
cyclic permutations and re-ranking movies based on user preference. We show
that our method learns non-trivial distributions even in the least expressive
mode, while traditional models fail to even generate valid permutations in this
setting.

Motivation: 现实世界数据通常位于高维空间中的低维黎曼流形上，但若流形具有非平凡拓扑结构，单一流无法正确学习，需多流拼接。

Method: 提出了一种通用的多流训练方案，并开发了计算流形上测地线的数值算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了拓扑估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过多流拼接和测地线计算，有效解决了低维流形学习的拓扑挑战。

Abstract: Real world data often lie on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds embedded in
high-dimensional spaces. This motivates learning degenerate normalizing flows
that map between the ambient space and a low-dimensional latent space. However,
if the manifold has a non-trivial topology, it can never be correctly learned
using a single flow. Instead multiple flows must be `glued together'. In this
paper, we first propose the general training scheme for learning such a
collection of flows, and secondly we develop the first numerical algorithms for
computing geodesics on such manifolds. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
leads to highly significant improvements in topology estimation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数字化历史房产评估数据的方法，包括OCR技术和回归模型，以量化1930年代美国住房政策对种族财富差距的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于历史房产评估记录难以获取且多为纸质形式，学者难以量化这些政策对种族财富差距的具体财务影响。

Method: 通过手动标注12,000多处房产卡片训练OCR技术，并结合计算机视觉和深度学习OCR处理50,000处房产数据；对于无法使用OCR的情况，采用基于建筑特征的回归模型估算历史价值。

Result: 成功构建并发布了一个县的数据集，验证了OCR和回归模型的有效性，并测试了模型的通用性。

Conclusion: 这些工具为学者、社区活动家和政策制定者提供了成本效益高的方法，以更深入地分析红线的历史影响。

Abstract: Despite well-documented consequences of the U.S. government's 1930s housing
policies on racial wealth disparities, scholars have struggled to quantify its
precise financial effects due to the inaccessibility of historical property
appraisal records. Many counties still store these records in physical formats,
making large-scale quantitative analysis difficult. We present an approach
scholars can use to digitize historical housing assessment data, applying it to
build and release a dataset for one county. Starting from publicly available
scanned documents, we manually annotated property cards for over 12,000
properties to train and validate our methods. We use OCR to label data for an
additional 50,000 properties, based on our two-stage approach combining
classical computer vision techniques with deep learning-based OCR. For cases
where OCR cannot be applied, such as when scanned documents are not available,
we show how a regression model based on building feature data can estimate the
historical values, and test the generalizability of this model to other
counties. With these cost-effective tools, scholars, community activists, and
policy makers can better analyze and understand the historical impacts of
redlining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了变分自编码器（VAEs）中隐式归纳偏置对解缠表示的影响，提出了“解缠粒度”的概念，并通过实验验证了其在优化ELBO轨迹和解缠性能中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VAEs在学习语义上有意义的无监督解缠表示方面取得了成功，但缺乏明确的隐式归纳偏置使得无监督解缠难以实现。本文旨在探索这种隐式偏置，特别是因子化先验下的解缠机制。

Method: 通过分析β-TCVAE中的总相关性，提出了“解缠粒度”的概念，并设计了新模型β-STCVAE。通过超过10万次实验验证了其在优化ELBO轨迹和解缠性能中的作用。

Result: 实验表明，传统因子化VAEs由于固定的解缠粒度，倾向于解缠低复杂度特征；而β-STCVAE通过调整解缠粒度，能够解缠更高复杂度的特征。

Conclusion: 解缠粒度是因子化VAEs中的一种隐式归纳偏置，影响解缠性能和ELBO推断，为VAEs的可解释性和内在偏置提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite the success in learning semantically meaningful, unsupervised
disentangled representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) and their
variants face a fundamental theoretical challenge: substantial evidence
indicates that unsupervised disentanglement is unattainable without implicit
inductive bias, yet such bias remains elusive. In this work, we focus on
exploring the implicit inductive bias that drive disentanglement in VAEs with
factorization priors. By analyzing the total correlation in \b{eta}-TCVAE, we
uncover a crucial implicit inductive bias called disentangling granularity,
which leads to the discovery of an interesting "V"-shaped optimal Evidence
Lower Bound (ELBO) trajectory within the parameter space. This finding is
validated through over 100K experiments using factorized VAEs and our newly
proposed model, \b{eta}-STCVAE. Notably, experimental results reveal that
conventional factorized VAEs, constrained by fixed disentangling granularity,
inherently tend to disentangle low-complexity feature. Whereas, appropriately
tuning disentangling granularity, as enabled by \b{eta}-STCVAE, broadens the
range of disentangled representations, allowing for the disentanglement of
high-complexity features. Our findings unveil that disentangling granularity as
an implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs influence both disentanglement
performance and the inference of the ELBO, offering fresh insights into the
interpretability and inherent biases of VAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂老虎机算法假设奖励环境是平稳的且臂数较少，现有方法通常只放宽其中一个假设。本文旨在同时解决这两个限制。

Method: 使用高斯插值学习连续Lipschitz奖励函数，并扩展到非平稳问题。

Conclusion: 新策略在连续和非平稳环境中高效且计算优越，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Canonical algorithms for multi-armed bandits typically assume a stationary
reward environment where the size of the action space (number of arms) is
small. More recently developed methods typically relax only one of these
assumptions: existing non-stationary bandit policies are designed for a small
number of arms, while Lipschitz, linear, and Gaussian process bandit policies
are designed to handle a large (or infinite) number of arms in stationary
reward environments under constraints on the reward function. In this
manuscript, we propose a novel policy to learn reward environments over a
continuous space using Gaussian interpolation. We show that our method
efficiently learns continuous Lipschitz reward functions with
$\mathcal{O}^*(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret. Furthermore, our method naturally
extends to non-stationary problems with a simple modification. We finally
demonstrate that our method is computationally favorable (100-10000x faster)
and experimentally outperforms sliding Gaussian process policies on datasets
with non-stationarity and an extremely large number of arms.

Result: 实验证明，SymPO在合成和真实任务中均能有效优化策略，即使存在噪声标签。

Conclusion: 对称损失函数能保持奖励的排序一致性，为策略优化提供了鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing policies based on human preferences is key to aligning language
models with human intent. This work focuses on reward modeling, a core
component in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and offline
preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization. Conventional
approaches typically assume accurate annotations. However, real-world
preference data often contains noise due to human errors or biases. We propose
a principled framework for robust policy optimization under noisy preferences,
viewing reward modeling as a classification problem. This allows us to leverage
symmetric losses, known for their robustness to label noise in classification,
leading to our Symmetric Preference Optimization (SymPO) method. We prove that
symmetric losses enable successful policy optimization even under noisy labels,
as the resulting reward remains rank-preserving -- a property sufficient for
policy improvement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of SymPO.

Motivation: 传统预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）在决策任务中缺乏推理能力且难以适应新环境，限制了其在复杂现实任务中的应用。

Method: 提出因果感知LLMs，采用“学习-适应-行动”范式：1）学习阶段提取环境因果实体和关系初始化SCM；2）适应阶段通过因果干预更新SCM；3）行动阶段利用SCM知识通过强化学习代理制定策略。

Result: 在开放世界游戏“Crafter”的22个任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 因果感知LLMs通过迭代学习因果知识，能更准确地理解环境并做出高效决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making
due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these
pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to
adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex
real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive
process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal
model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize
structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting"
paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to
extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to
initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the
adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback
about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the
acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more
efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above
processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately
enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the
environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22
diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness
of our proposed method.

Result: 在SWE-bench和Long Code Arena的错误定位数据集上，检索召回率比现有模型至少提高15个百分点。

Conclusion: CoRet通过优化设计选择，显著提升了代码检索性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for
code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and
call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a
code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement
new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to
a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a
loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench
and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model
substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over
existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in
achieving these results.

Abstract: We introduce PDE-Transformer, an improved transformer-based architecture for
surrogate modeling of physics simulations on regular grids. We combine recent
architectural improvements of diffusion transformers with adjustments specific
for large-scale simulations to yield a more scalable and versatile
general-purpose transformer architecture, which can be used as the backbone for
building large-scale foundation models in physical sciences. We demonstrate
that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art transformer
architectures for computer vision on a large dataset of 16 different types of
PDEs. We propose to embed different physical channels individually as
spatio-temporal tokens, which interact via channel-wise self-attention. This
helps to maintain a consistent information density of tokens when learning
multiple types of PDEs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our pre-trained
models achieve improved performance on several challenging downstream tasks
compared to training from scratch and also beat other foundation model
architectures for physics simulations.

Abstract: Memristor-based hardware offers new possibilities for energy-efficient
machine learning (ML) by providing analog in-memory matrix multiplication.
Current hardware prototypes cannot fit large neural networks, and related
literature covers only small ML models for tasks like MNIST or single word
recognition. Simulation can be used to explore how hardware properties affect
larger models, but existing software assumes simplified hardware. We propose a
PyTorch-based library based on "Synaptogen" to simulate neural network
execution with accurately captured memristor hardware properties. For the first
time, we show how an ML system with millions of parameters would behave on
memristor hardware, using a Conformer trained on the speech recognition task
TED-LIUMv2 as example. With adjusted quantization-aware training, we limit the
relative degradation in word error rate to 25% when using a 3-bit weight
precision to execute linear operations via simulated analog computation.

Motivation: 自然语言具有内在的语义层次和几何结构，但现有的大语言模型（LLMs）依赖欧几里得操作，无法完全捕捉这些特性，导致训练不稳定和生成能力下降。

Method: 提出HELM系列模型，包括HELM-MICE（混合曲率专家模型）和HELM-D（密集模型），并引入双曲多头潜在注意力（HMLA）和双曲旋转位置编码等技术。

Result: 在MMLU和ARC等基准测试中，HELM模型相比欧几里得模型（如LLaMA和DeepSeek）性能提升高达4%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何在大规模语言模型预训练中表现出更高的效能和推理能力，为语言建模提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in text modeling tasks
across domains. However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic
hierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture
completely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have
also shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to
training instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These
findings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align
language models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to
operate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and
low-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large
Language Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM
that addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary
operations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally
introduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert
operates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric
structure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we
further develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient,
reduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential
hyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We
are the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and
evaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM
problem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show
consistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular
Euclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy
and enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM
pretraining.

Result: 理论证明SMRFL与无扰动的联邦学习收敛速度相同，实验表明其在三种扰动场景下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SMRFL有效提升了联邦学习模型对扰动的鲁棒性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for realizing edge
intelligence, allowing collaborative learning among distributed edge devices by
sharing models instead of raw data. However, the shared models are often
assumed to be ideal, which would be inevitably violated in practice due to
various perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation. To
overcome this challenge, we propose a novel method, termed Sharpness-Aware
Minimization-based Robust Federated Learning (SMRFL), which aims to improve
model robustness against perturbations by exploring the geometrical property of
the model landscape. Specifically, SMRFL solves a min-max optimization problem
that promotes model convergence towards a flat minimum by minimizing the
maximum loss within a neighborhood of the model parameters. In this way, model
sensitivity to perturbations is reduced, and robustness is enhanced since
models in the neighborhood of the flat minimum also enjoy low loss values. The
theoretical result proves that SMRFL can converge at the same rate as FL
without perturbations. Extensive experimental results show that SMRFL
significantly enhances robustness against perturbations compared to three
baseline methods on two real-world datasets under three perturbation scenarios.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are a popular approach to explain the behavior of
machine learning models. They assign importance scores to each input feature,
quantifying their influence on the model's prediction. However, evaluating
these methods empirically remains a significant challenge. To bypass this
shortcoming, several prior works have proposed axiomatic frameworks that any
feature attribution method should satisfy. In this work, we argue that such
axioms are often too restrictive, and propose in response a new feature
attribution framework, built from the ground up. Rather than imposing axioms,
we start by defining attributions for the simplest possible models, i.e.,
indicator functions, and use these as building blocks for more complex models.
We then show that one recovers several existing attribution methods, depending
on the choice of atomic attribution. Subsequently, we derive closed-form
expressions for attribution of deep ReLU networks, and take a step toward the
optimization of evaluation metrics with respect to feature attributions.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of differentially private empirical risk
minimization (DP-ERM) for binary linear classification. We obtain an efficient
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm with an empirical zero-one risk bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2\varepsilon n} +
\frac{|S_{\mathrm{out}}|}{\gamma n}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of data
points, $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is an arbitrary subset of data one can remove and
$\gamma$ is the margin of linear separation of the remaining data points (after
$S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is removed). Here, $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides only logarithmic
terms. In the agnostic case, we improve the existing results when the number of
outliers is small. Our algorithm is highly adaptive because it does not require
knowing the margin parameter $\gamma$ or outlier subset $S_{\mathrm{out}}$. We
also derive a utility bound for the advanced private hyperparameter tuning
algorithm.

Result: SUMO在收敛速度、稳定性、性能和内存效率（提升20%）上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SUMO通过精确正交化和动态子空间调整，显著优化了LLM训练的效率和效果。

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved
memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling
operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.
However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking
potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard
isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the
highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In
this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an
optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment
orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace,
enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly
aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss
landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with
commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We
theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving
their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we
analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we
both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via
SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity.
Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances
stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20%
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AFLoRA通过创新设计有效解决了联邦微调LLM的挑战，提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation
models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world
deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication
demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and
system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the
global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and
further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods
leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to
simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low
system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these
challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated
fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific
updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates
diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and
employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen
generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous
environments in the real world.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is fundamental to solving complex
decision-making problems. The proliferation of MILP instance generation
methods, driven by machine learning's demand for diverse optimization datasets
and the limitations of static benchmarks, has significantly outpaced
standardized evaluation techniques. Consequently, assessing the fidelity and
utility of synthetic MILP instances remains a critical, multifaceted challenge.
This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework designed for the
systematic and objective evaluation of MILP instance generation methods. Our
framework provides a unified and extensible methodology, assessing instance
quality across crucial dimensions: mathematical validity, structural
similarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream machine learning
tasks. A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features --
particularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root
node gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the
solver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced
computational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly
defined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to
facilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the
development of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the
reliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's
effectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is
demonstrated using contemporary generative models.

Motivation: 量子机器学习中的数据增强研究不足，为解决数据稀缺问题，研究者探索将QGANs与HQCNNs结合以提升模型性能。

Method: 提出两种策略：通用方法增强HQCNNs的数据处理和分类能力；定制化方法根据HQCNN在特定数据类别上的表现动态生成样本。实验在MNIST数据集上进行。

Result: QGAN在MNIST数据集上优于传统数据增强方法和经典GANs，参数减半但性能相当。

Conclusion: QGANs能简化模型并生成高质量数据，提升HQCNNs的精度和性能，为量子数据增强技术在机器学习中的应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks converge faster and achieve higher accuracy than
classical models. However, data augmentation in quantum machine learning
remains underexplored. To tackle data scarcity, we integrate quantum generative
adversarial networks (QGANs) with hybrid quantum-classical neural networks
(HQCNNs) to develop an augmentation framework. We propose two strategies: a
general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs,
and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the
HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn
from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate
that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs.
Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the
parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs
can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy
and performance. These findings pave the way for applying quantum data
augmentation techniques in machine learning.

Motivation: 自回归模型在生成高质量样本时存在严格的顺序依赖性，导致推理速度慢，限制了实际应用。论文发现这种严格依赖并非必要，并提出了一种加速方法。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多个数据集上实现了高达4.7倍的推理加速，同时保持了生成质量和保真度。

Conclusion: SeJD策略有效解决了自回归模型推理速度慢的问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Normalizing flows are promising generative models with advantages such as
theoretical rigor, analytical log-likelihood computation, and end-to-end
training. However, the architectural constraints to ensure invertibility and
tractable Jacobian computation limit their expressive power and practical
usability. Recent advancements utilize autoregressive modeling, significantly
enhancing expressive power and generation quality. However, such sequential
modeling inherently restricts parallel computation during inference, leading to
slow generation that impedes practical deployment. In this paper, we first
identify that strict sequential dependency in inference is unnecessary to
generate high-quality samples. We observe that patches in sequential modeling
can also be approximated without strictly conditioning on all preceding
patches. Moreover, the models tend to exhibit low dependency redundancy in the
initial layer and higher redundancy in subsequent layers. Leveraging these
observations, we propose a selective Jacobi decoding (SeJD) strategy that
accelerates autoregressive inference through parallel iterative optimization.
Theoretical analyses demonstrate the method's superlinear convergence rate and
guarantee that the number of iterations required is no greater than the
original sequential approach. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets
validate the generality and effectiveness of our acceleration technique.
Experiments demonstrate substantial speed improvements up to 4.7 times faster
inference while keeping the generation quality and fidelity.

Result: 评估多个先进LLMs和提示类型，发现它们无法与专家推理路径对齐。

Conclusion: 研究为开发具有高效、稳健和可解释性原理推理的AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: RTS-PnO框架在资金分配问题中表现优异，解决了传统方法的局限性，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial
domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a
certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or
Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the
introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces
additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems
mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate
(RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models.
Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with
objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty
calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of
RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline
experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are
used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other
competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border
Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed
when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline
experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.

Result: 仅0.25%的污染率即可显著放大偏见，学生模型的偏见表现高于教师模型，现有防御措施效果不佳。

Conclusion: 蒸馏模型存在重大安全漏洞，需开发专门的对抗性偏见缓解策略。

Abstract: Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable
language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread
deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This
paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection
of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject
subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which
propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose
two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple
tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining
normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning
rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted
scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation,
adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen
tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements,
phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various
distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code
generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses -
perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater
frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security
vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized
safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective
adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: 通过不变数据对和NCM方法，可以有效提升模型鲁棒性，尤其在预训练骨干网络上线性探测表现更优。

Abstract: Spurious correlations can cause model performance to degrade in new
environments. Prior causality-inspired works aim to learn invariant
representations (e.g., IRM) but typically underperform empirical risk
minimization (ERM). Recent alternatives improve robustness by leveraging
test-time data, but such data may be unavailable in practice. To address these
issues, we take a data-centric approach by leveraging invariant data pairs,
pairs of samples that would have the same prediction with the optimally robust
classifier. We prove that certain counterfactual pairs will naturally satisfy
this invariance property and introduce noisy counterfactual matching (NCM), a
simple constraint-based method for leveraging invariant pairs for enhanced
robustness, even with a small set of noisy pairs-in the ideal case, each pair
can eliminate one spurious feature. For linear causal models, we prove that the
test domain error can be upper bounded by the in-domain error and a term that
depends on the counterfactuals' diversity and quality. We validate on a
synthetic dataset and demonstrate on real-world benchmarks that linear probing
on a pretrained backbone improves robustness.

Abstract: Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large
language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly
weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this
end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon,
that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned
embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain
embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights
domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation
allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In
experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our
computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of
the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes
without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when
transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting
in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains
over uniform mixture. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法仅利用正例推理数据，忽视了负例数据的价值，论文旨在探索如何有效利用正负数据提升模型性能。

Method: 提出REDI框架：第一阶段通过监督微调（SFT）学习正例数据；第二阶段通过REDI目标函数同时利用正负数据进行优化。

Result: REDI在数学推理任务中表现优于基线方法，Qwen-REDI-1.5B模型在MATH-500上达到83.1%的准确率，性能媲美或超越基于专有数据的模型。

Conclusion: REDI框架通过有效利用正负数据，显著提升了小模型的推理能力，为离线训练提供了新的高效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer
complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However,
standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning
examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the
critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning
traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an
offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a
two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and
negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a
simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like
DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations
demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT
combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the
Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples
from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1).
Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a
model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models
post-trained offline with openly available data.

Conclusion: EB-Sampler显著提升MDMs采样效率，适用于多种推理任务，尤其优于自回归模型（ARMs）。

Abstract: Recent masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown competitive performance
compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) for language modeling. While most
literature has focused on performance enhancing sampling procedures, efficient
sampling from MDMs has been scarcely explored. We make the observation that
often a given sequence of partially masked tokens determines the values of
multiple unknown tokens deterministically, meaning that a single prediction of
a masked model holds additional information unused by standard sampling
procedures. Based on this observation, we introduce EB-Sampler, a simple
drop-in replacement for existing samplers, utilizing an Entropy Bounded
unmasking procedure that dynamically unmasks multiple tokens in one function
evaluation with predefined approximate error tolerance. We formulate the
EB-Sampler as part of a broad family of adaptive samplers for which we provide
an error analysis that motivates our algorithmic choices. EB-Sampler
accelerates sampling from current state of the art MDMs by roughly 2-3x on
standard coding and math reasoning benchmarks without loss in performance. We
also validate the same procedure works well on smaller reasoning tasks
including maze navigation and Sudoku, tasks ARMs often struggle with.

Result: 转向向量能有效控制目标属性，但高强度转向会降低文本质量；提示方法控制较弱但质量保持较好；结合两者效果最佳。

Conclusion: 转向向量在自由生成任务中需权衡控制强度与文本质量，结合转向和提示是最优策略。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by
adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far,
steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings,
while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied.
Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of
steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity,
and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that
steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high
steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text
quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while
preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest
control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality
trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical
trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying
steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training
neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of
interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods
traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but
they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the
other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art
performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often
unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with
symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to
use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question:
What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning
have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight
three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the
compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position
paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic
solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of
neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.

Result: 在MD集成基准测试中，EBA在生成高质量蛋白质集成方面达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EBA提高了生成结构的物理合理性，对结构生物学和药物发现具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Protein dynamics play a crucial role in protein biological functions and
properties, and their traditional study typically relies on time-consuming
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted in silico. Recent advances in
generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled
efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by
learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively
integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains
challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Energy-based Alignment (EBA), a
method that aligns generative models with feedback from physical models,
efficiently calibrating them to appropriately balance conformational states
based on their energy differences. Experimental results on the MD ensemble
benchmark demonstrate that EBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-quality protein ensembles. By improving the physical
plausibility of generated structures, our approach enhances model predictions
and holds promise for applications in structural biology and drug discovery.

Conclusion: 自然语言通信在自动驾驶中具有潜力，LLM+Debrief方法为车辆协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Past work has demonstrated that autonomous vehicles can drive more safely if
they communicate with one another than if they do not. However, their
communication has often not been human-understandable. Using natural language
as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol offers the potential for
autonomous vehicles to drive cooperatively not only with each other but also
with human drivers. In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in
autonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in
natural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent
collision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper
introduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and
high-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent
discussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like
simulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at
generating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to
facilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent. Our code

Motivation: 当前手势识别方法局限于短距离交互，限制了其在需要远距离辅助通信的场景中的应用。

Method: 结合Depth-Conditioned Deformable Alignment (DADA)块和时空图模块，并引入Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL)以增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在多样化数据集上达到97.3%的识别准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiG-Net显著提升了辅助机器人在家庭医疗、工业安全和远程协助等场景中的可用性，为用户提供无缝且直观的交互体验。

Abstract: Dynamic hand gestures play a pivotal role in assistive human-robot
interaction (HRI), facilitating intuitive, non-verbal communication,
particularly for individuals with mobility constraints or those operating
robots remotely. Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to
short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust
assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture
recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly
improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware
Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable
Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust
processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging
conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and
dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive
environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth
Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model
robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant
performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks,
achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging
hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable
distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in
home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling
seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical
limitations

Conclusion: 任务相关检索模型结合规划目标显著提升性能，RealDrive在安全性和可控性上优于传统学习型规划器。

Abstract: Learning-based planners generate natural human-like driving behaviors by
learning to reason about nuanced interactions from data, overcoming the rigid
behaviors that arise from rule-based planners. Nonetheless, data-driven
approaches often struggle with rare, safety-critical scenarios and offer
limited controllability over the generated trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose RealDrive, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework that initializes a diffusion-based planning policy by retrieving the
most relevant expert demonstrations from the training dataset. By interpolating
between current observations and retrieved examples through a denoising
process, our approach enables fine-grained control and safe behavior across
diverse scenarios, leveraging the strong prior provided by the retrieved
scenario. Another key insight we produce is that a task-relevant retrieval
model trained with planning-based objectives results in superior planning
performance in our framework compared to a task-agnostic retriever.
Experimental results demonstrate improved generalization to long-tail events
and enhanced trajectory diversity compared to standard learning-based planners
-- we observe a 40% reduction in collision rate on the Waymo Open Motion
dataset with RAG.

Abstract: We study the problem of functional retargeting: learning dexterous
manipulation policies to track object states from human hand-object
demonstrations. We focus on long-horizon, bimanual tasks with articulated
objects, which is challenging due to large action space, spatiotemporal
discontinuities, and embodiment gap between human and robot hands. We propose
DexMachina, a novel curriculum-based algorithm: the key idea is to use virtual
object controllers with decaying strength: an object is first driven
automatically towards its target states, such that the policy can gradually
learn to take over under motion and contact guidance. We release a simulation
benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and dexterous hands, and show that
DexMachina significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our algorithm and
benchmark enable a functional comparison for hardware designs, and we present
key findings informed by quantitative and qualitative results. With the recent
surge in dexterous hand development, we hope this work will provide a useful
platform for identifying desirable hardware capabilities and lower the barrier
for contributing to future research. Videos and more at

Conclusion: Bi-JCR提供了一种高效、无标记的多机器人臂校准和表示方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Robot manipulation, especially bimanual manipulation, often requires setting
up multiple cameras on multiple robot manipulators. Before robot manipulators
can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the
cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration
is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each
capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual
Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables
multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking
images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense,
marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the
extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the
inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified,
scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same
captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images
captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame
and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate
downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness
of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its
applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.

models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX
reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the
data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current
tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support
model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are expected to perform effective multimodal
reasoning and make logically coherent decisions, which is critical to tasks
such as diagram understanding and spatial problem solving. However, current VLM
reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge
this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic

synthesis with grounding answers, we propose a rule-to-image synthesis
pipeline, which extracts and expands puzzle rules from seed questions and
generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample
assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx
benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit
improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning
capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks
such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.

Result: 实验表明MPR能有效衡量多交叉群体的代表性，并指导模型在保持生成质量的同时实现更平衡的生成。

Conclusion: MPR为T2I模型的公平性提供了一种灵活且可定制的评估和优化方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models can create vivid, realistic images from
textual descriptions. As these models proliferate, they expose new concerns
about their ability to represent diverse demographic groups, propagate
stereotypes, and efface minority populations. Despite growing attention to the
"safe" and "responsible" design of artificial intelligence (AI), there is no
established methodology to systematically measure and control representational
harms in image generation. This paper introduces a novel framework to measure
the representation of intersectional groups in images generated by T2I models
by applying the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric. MPR
evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across given
population groups in images produced by a generative model, allowing for
flexible and context-specific measurements based on user requirements. We also
develop an algorithm to optimize T2I models for this metric. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that MPR can effectively measure representation
statistics across multiple intersectional groups and, when used as a training
objective, can guide models toward a more balanced generation across
demographic groups while maintaining generation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型的推理能力已通过强化学习取得显著成功，但视觉基础模型（如DINO系列）的推理能力仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出GRQO训练策略，结合KL正则化稳定目标分布，通过视觉提示编码器和查询选择机制优化模型。

Result: 在COCO、LVIS和ODinW等数据集上，DINO-R1显著优于监督微调基线，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DINO-R1通过强化学习成功提升了视觉基础模型的推理能力，为视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language
models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through
reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods
like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning
abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models,
including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose
\textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context
reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement
learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query
Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly
designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level
rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply
KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the
training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive
supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional
drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models
that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that
DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving
strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting
scenarios.

TL;DR: MaskAdapt通过结合RGB图像和深度数据，提出了一种新的无监督域适应方法，显著提升了作物与杂草的语义分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖像素级标注且难以适应不同农田的域偏移问题，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: MaskAdapt利用深度梯度解决纹理模糊问题，并通过几何感知掩码策略增强空间上下文学习。

Result: 在真实农田数据集上，MaskAdapt在mIOU指标上优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: MaskAdapt通过多模态上下文学习有效解决了作物与杂草分割中的域适应问题。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is crucial for site-specific farm
management; however, most existing methods depend on labor intensive
pixel-level annotations. A further challenge arises when models trained on one
field (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to
domain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,
and crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by
enabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods
struggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading
to misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy
through multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features
derived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our
method captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.
These gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature
representations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we
propose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,
and stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the
broader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real
agricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms
existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation
mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.

Conclusion: VLMs在科学推理能力上仍有显著不足，CSVQA为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet their capabilities for scientific reasoning
remains inadequately assessed. Current multimodal benchmarks predominantly
evaluate generic image comprehension or text-driven reasoning, lacking
authentic scientific contexts that require domain-specific knowledge
integration with visual evidence analysis. To fill this gap, we present CSVQA,
a diagnostic multimodal benchmark specifically designed for evaluating
scientific reasoning through domain-grounded visual question answering.Our
benchmark features 1,378 carefully constructed question-answer pairs spanning
diverse STEM disciplines, each demanding domain knowledge, integration of
visual evidence, and higher-order reasoning. Compared to prior multimodal
benchmarks, CSVQA places greater emphasis on real-world scientific content and
complex reasoning.We additionally propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to
systematically assess whether model predictions are substantiated by valid
intermediate reasoning steps based on curated explanations. Our comprehensive
evaluation of 15 VLMs on this benchmark reveals notable performance
disparities, as even the top-ranked proprietary model attains only 49.6\%
accuracy.This empirical evidence underscores the pressing need for advancing
scientific reasoning capabilities in VLMs. Our CSVQA is released at

TL;DR: S4-Driver是一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的自监督运动规划算法，通过稀疏体积策略将2D视觉表示转换为3D空间，无需微调视觉编码器，显著提升了自动驾驶轨迹预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖人工标注或自监督方法性能不足，且MLLMs通常在2D图像空间预训练，与自动驾驶的3D规划空间不匹配。

Method: 提出S4-Driver算法，利用稀疏体积策略将MLLMs的视觉表示从透视视图无缝转换到3D空间，聚合多视角和多帧视觉输入。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo Open Motion Dataset上的实验表明，S4-Driver优于现有监督多任务方法，且无需人工标注，具有强扩展性。

Conclusion: S4-Driver通过自监督学习和3D视觉表示，显著提升了自动驾驶运动规划的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: The latest advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
spurred a strong renewed interest in end-to-end motion planning approaches for
autonomous driving. Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to
learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely
self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate
planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of
the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end
approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image
space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To
this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning
algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI
multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy
to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from
perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder.
This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and
enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our
method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with
in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against
existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations.
It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of
unannotated driving logs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research
and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a
critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of
these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology
foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial
attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation
with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates
without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack
framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the
perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models
across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of
patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream
accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore,
we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship
between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a
preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay
the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable
deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 论文指出多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉物理推理方面表现不佳，提出MVPBench基准和基于图的CoT一致性指标进行评估，发现当前模型在物理领域表现较差，且RL微调可能损害空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在物理世界的理解上存在显著不足，尤其是在视觉物理推理方面。研究旨在揭示这一缺陷并提出评估方法。

Method: 引入MVPBench基准，通过视觉链式思维（CoT）评估模型，并使用图基CoT一致性指标验证推理路径的物理逻辑性。

Result: 实验显示，即使是前沿的MLLMs在视觉物理推理和图像-文本对齐方面表现不佳，RL微调反而可能损害空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在物理推理方面存在重大缺陷，需重新思考微调方法，MVPBench为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world - governed by laws of motion, spatial
relations, and causality - poses a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While recent advances such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-4o
demonstrate impressive perceptual and reasoning capabilities, our investigation
reveals these models struggle profoundly with visual physical reasoning,
failing to grasp basic physical laws, spatial interactions, and causal effects
in complex scenes. More importantly, they often fail to follow coherent
reasoning chains grounded in visual evidence, especially when multiple steps
are needed to arrive at the correct answer. To rigorously evaluate this
capability, we introduce MVPBench, a curated benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate visual physical reasoning through the lens of visual chain-of-thought
(CoT). Each example features interleaved multi-image inputs and demands not
only the correct final answer but also a coherent, step-by-step reasoning path
grounded in evolving visual cues. This setup mirrors how humans reason through
real-world physical processes over time. To ensure fine-grained evaluation, we
introduce a graph-based CoT consistency metric that verifies whether the
reasoning path of model adheres to valid physical logic. Additionally, we
minimize shortcut exploitation from text priors, encouraging models to rely on
visual understanding. Experimental results reveal a concerning trend: even
cutting-edge MLLMs exhibit poor visual reasoning accuracy and weak image-text
alignment in physical domains. Surprisingly, RL-based post-training alignment -
commonly believed to improve visual reasoning performance - often harms spatial
reasoning, suggesting a need to rethink current fine-tuning practices.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在生物识别任务中的零样本和少样本性能，提出了一个综合基准测试，覆盖了六种生物识别任务，并展示了这些模型在无需微调的情况下取得的高性能。


<details>

Motivation: 探索预训练模型在生物识别任务中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用41种公开可用的VLMs和MLLMs，评估其在六种生物识别任务中的性能，包括人脸验证、软生物特征预测、虹膜识别、呈现攻击检测和人脸操纵检测。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些模型在无需微调的情况下，在多种任务中表现优异，例如人脸验证在LFW数据集上达到96.77%的TMR（1% FMR），虹膜识别在IITD-R-Full数据集上达到97.55%的TMR（1% FMR）。

Conclusion: 预训练模型在生物识别任务中表现出巨大潜力，为实现通用人工智能的长期愿景提供了支持。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has redefined the frontiers of
artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable generalization across diverse
tasks with minimal or no supervision. Yet, their potential in biometric
recognition and analysis remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot
performance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six
biometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft
biometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition,
presentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs
and deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments
show that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse
biometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of
face verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a
False Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW)
dataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1
percent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any
fine-tuning. Further, we show that applying a simple classifier head to these
embeddings can help perform DeepFake detection for faces, Presentation Attack
Detection (PAD) for irides, and extract soft biometric attributes like gender
and ethnicity from faces with reasonably high accuracy. This work reiterates
the potential of pretrained models in achieving the long-term vision of
Artificial General Intelligence.

TL;DR: 研究发现，链式思维（CoT）提示可能降低大语言模型（LLM）的归纳推理能力，而非增强。通过理论框架和实验分析，提出了结构化干预方法以提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索链式思维提示（CoT）是否真正提升大语言模型的归纳推理能力，并揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 设计了四个基于游戏的诊断任务（如国际象棋、德州扑克等），比较CoT与非CoT模型的性能，并提出理论框架分析失败模式。

Result: CoT推理可能降低归纳推理性能，且存在三种失败模式：子任务分解错误、子任务解决错误和最终答案总结错误。

Conclusion: 有效的CoT推理不仅需要更多步骤，还需确保步骤结构合理。提出的结构化干预方法在不重新训练的情况下提升了准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains,
yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from
sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought
(CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such
reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled,
diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack -
with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade
inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning
counterparts.
  To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how
reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect
sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer
summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce
structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified
failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without
retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not
only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的理论框架，将越狱攻击和幻觉问题分别建模为令牌级和注意力级优化，揭示了二者的相似性和共享的注意力动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（LFMs）容易受到越狱攻击和幻觉问题的影响，而针对其中一种的防御措施往往会影响另一种，这表明二者存在深层联系。

Method: 通过将越狱攻击建模为令牌级优化，幻觉问题建模为注意力级优化，提出了两个关键命题：相似损失收敛和注意力重新分配中的梯度一致性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和MiniGPT-4上的实验验证了优化趋势和梯度行为的一致性，并表明针对一种问题的缓解技术可以降低另一种问题的发生率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LFMs中的共享失败模式，建议鲁棒性策略应同时解决这两种漏洞。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) are susceptible to two distinct
vulnerabilities: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. While typically studied
in isolation, we observe that defenses targeting one often affect the other,
hinting at a deeper connection.
  We propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as
token-level optimization and hallucinations as attention-level optimization.
Within this framework, we establish two key propositions: (1) \textit{Similar
Loss Convergence} - the loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge
similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs; and (2) \textit{Gradient
Consistency in Attention Redistribution} - both exhibit consistent gradient
behavior driven by shared attention dynamics.
  We validate these propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4,
showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients. Leveraging this
connection, we demonstrate that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can
reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a shared
failure mode in LFMs and suggest that robustness strategies should jointly
address both vulnerabilities.

Result: 在图像和文本条件形状生成任务中表现优于现有方法，提升了提示保真度和结构准确性。

Conclusion: LTM3D提供了一个通用框架，支持多模态、多表示的3D生成，效果显著。

Abstract: We present LTM3D, a Latent Token space Modeling framework for conditional 3D
shape generation that integrates the strengths of diffusion and auto-regressive
(AR) models. While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent
spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining
these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this,
LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a
masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning.
Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with
shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities.
We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with
Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural
fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling
support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields,
point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments on
image- and text-conditioned shape generation tasks demonstrate that LTM3D
outperforms existing methods in prompt fidelity and structural accuracy while
offering a generalizable framework for multi-modal, multi-representation 3D
generation.

Motivation: 现有基于文本条件的扩散模型在交互式视频生成中难以控制运动元素（如物体轨迹），且训练无关的注意力掩码方法会导致感知质量下降。

Method: 提出掩码归一化层以解决注意力掩码引起的内部协变量偏移，并引入时间内在扩散先验以解决初始化噪声与IVG条件不匹配的问题。

Result: 实验表明，掩码归一化和时间内在去噪显著提升了感知质量和轨迹控制能力，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过域适应启发的解决方案，本文成功改进了交互式视频生成的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality video generation. However, enabling Interactive Video Generation
(IVG), where users control motion elements such as object trajectory, remains
challenging. Recent training-free approaches introduce attention masking to
guide trajectory, but this often degrades perceptual quality. We identify two
key failure modes in these methods, both of which we interpret as domain shift
problems, and propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation. First, we
attribute the perceptual degradation to internal covariate shift induced by
attention masking, as pretrained models are not trained to handle masked
attention. To address this, we propose mask normalization, a pre-normalization
layer designed to mitigate this shift via distribution matching. Second, we
address initialization gap, where the randomly sampled initial noise does not
align with IVG conditioning, by introducing a temporal intrinsic diffusion
prior that enforces spatio-temporal consistency at each denoising step.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that mask
normalization and temporal intrinsic denoising improve both perceptual quality
and trajectory control over the existing state-of-the-art IVG techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Local and Global Area Transcription
(Grid-LoGAT) system for Video Question Answering (VideoQA). The system operates
in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a
Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts
to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures
image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To
improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which
extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with
global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the
open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA
datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our
method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度鸟类图像分类（FBIC）在生态监测和物种识别中具有重要意义，但由于鸟类大小、背景干扰和姿态变化等因素，传统方法难以稳定提取判别性特征。

Method: 提出了基于条带感知空间感知的框架，包含扩展感知聚合器（EPA）和通道语义编织（CSW）两个模块，分别整合局部与全局信息以及长距离与短距离语义。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持架构效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强空间依赖性和语义融合，有效解决了FBIC中的挑战，为细粒度视觉建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained bird image classification (FBIC) is not only of great
significance for ecological monitoring and species identification, but also
holds broad research value in the fields of image recognition and fine-grained
visual modeling. Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses
more formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging
distance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)
complex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and
highly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in
substantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it
difficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,
thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in
real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
fine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial
perception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire
rows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
interpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules:
extensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW).
Specifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues
by aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions.
CSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing
long-range and short-range information along the channel dimension. Built upon
a ResNet-50 backbone, the model enables jump-wise connection of extended
structural features across the spatial domain. Experimental results on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves significant
performance improvements while maintaining architectural efficiency.

Result: BioCLIP 2在物种分类、栖息地分类等任务中表现优异，嵌入空间具有生物学意义。

Conclusion: 大规模训练数据能增强模型涌现特性，形成更具生物学意义的嵌入空间。

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors,
learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find
such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive
vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,
comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse
biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on
TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training
objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various
biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We
identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At
the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns
closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and
habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the
intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better
separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide
formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and
contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our
results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with
larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding
space.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能直接比较模型在不同时间尺度上的性能，ScaleLong旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ScaleLong包含269个长视频，每个视频设计4-8个问题，覆盖四个时间尺度（秒、分钟、小时）。

Result: 评估23个MLLM显示，模型性能在最短和最长的时间尺度上较高，中间尺度较低；增加视觉标记容量能提升性能。

Conclusion: ScaleLong为长视频理解提供了一个细粒度的多时间尺度基准测试，推动MLLM能力的发展。

Abstract: Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical
temporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event
(minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this
multi-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos,
preventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same
content. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to
disentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical
timescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and
story (hours) -- all within the same video content. This within-content
multi-timescale questioning design enables direct comparison of model
performance across timescales on identical videos. ScaleLong features 269 long
videos (avg.\ 86\,min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4--8
carefully designed questions, including at least one question for each
timescale. Evaluating 23 MLLMs reveals a U-shaped performance curve, with
higher accuracy at the shortest and longest timescales and a dip at
intermediate levels. Furthermore, ablation studies show that increased visual
token capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales. ScaleLong
offers a fine-grained, multi-timescale benchmark for advancing MLLM
capabilities in long-video understanding. The code and dataset are available

Abstract: Object detection has recently seen an interesting trend in terms of the most
innovative research work, this task being of particular importance in the field
of remote sensing, given the consistency of these images in terms of
geographical coverage and the objects present. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL)
models, in particular those based on Transformers, are especially relevant for

the present work proposes an application of Deformable-DETR model, a specific
architecture using deformable attention mechanisms, on remote sensing images in
two different modes, especially optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To
achieve this objective, two datasets are used, one optical, which is Pleiades
Aircraft dataset, and the other SAR, in particular SAR Ship Detection Dataset
(SSDD). The results of a 10-fold stratified validation showed that the proposed
model performed particularly well, obtaining an F1 score of 95.12% for the
optical dataset and 94.54% for SSDD, while comparing these results with several
models detections, especially those based on CNNs and transformers, as well as
those specifically designed to detect different object classes in remote
sensing images.

TL;DR: DeepTopoNet利用深度学习结合雷达和BedMachine数据，通过动态损失平衡机制，填补格陵兰冰下地形观测空白，提高预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格陵兰冰下地形对预测冰盖质量损失及全球海平面上升至关重要，但观测数据稀疏且复杂，增加了模型不确定性。

Method: 提出DeepTopoNet框架，结合雷达冰厚观测与BedMachine数据，采用动态损失平衡机制和CNN架构，增强地形重建能力。

Result: 在Upernavik Isstrøm区域测试中，模型表现优于基线方法，显著提高了冰下地形重建精度。

Conclusion: 深度学习可有效填补观测空白，为冰下地形推断提供高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting
the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level
rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,
particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,
significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is
traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice
thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of
kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning
framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice
thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic
loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,
BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass
conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate
high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively
adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in
areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution
of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates
gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and
utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By
systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves
high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial
terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging
observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring
subglacial topography.

TL;DR: Mixpert是一种高效的混合视觉专家架构，通过动态路由机制分配输入图像到最适合的视觉专家，解决了单一视觉编码器在多任务学习中的领域冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一视觉编码器难以处理多样化的任务领域，容易导致冲突；而直接集成多个领域特定编码器会增加复杂性并限制联合优化潜力。

Method: 提出Mixpert架构，结合单视觉编码器的联合学习优势，重构为多专家范式，并设计动态路由机制。

Result: Mixpert在多任务学习中有效缓解领域冲突，计算成本低，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Mixpert高效且易于集成到任何MLLM中，为多任务学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require a nuanced interpretation of
complex image information, typically leveraging a vision encoder to perceive
various visual scenarios. However, relying solely on a single vision encoder to
handle diverse task domains proves difficult and inevitably leads to conflicts.
Recent work enhances data perception by directly integrating multiple
domain-specific vision encoders, yet this structure adds complexity and limits
the potential for joint optimization. In this paper, we introduce Mixpert, an
efficient mixture-of-vision-experts architecture that inherits the joint
learning advantages from a single vision encoder while being restructured into
a multi-expert paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning across different visual
tasks. Additionally, we design a dynamic routing mechanism that allocates input
images to the most suitable visual expert. Mixpert effectively alleviates
domain conflicts encountered by a single vision encoder in multi-task learning
with minimal additional computational cost, making it more efficient than
multiple encoders. Furthermore, Mixpert integrates seamlessly into any MLLM,
with experimental results demonstrating substantial performance gains across
various tasks.

Motivation: 解决地理空间图像分类中标注数据稀缺的问题，提供无需任务特定预训练的零样本分类方案。

Method: 使用vLLM生成图像描述，LLM映射到用户定义类别；复杂任务采用递归LLM驱动的聚类和分层分类。

Conclusion: GVL模块化、可解释，适用于广泛用例，已开源以促进实际应用。

Abstract: Classifying geospatial imagery remains a major bottleneck for applications
such as disaster response and land-use monitoring-particularly in regions where
annotated data is scarce or unavailable. Existing tools (e.g., RS-CLIP) that
claim zero-shot classification capabilities for satellite imagery nonetheless
rely on task-specific pretraining and adaptation to reach competitive
performance. We introduce GeoVision Labeler (GVL), a strictly zero-shot
classification framework: a vision Large Language Model (vLLM) generates rich,
human-readable image descriptions, which are then mapped to user-defined
classes by a conventional Large Language Model (LLM). This modular, and
interpretable pipeline enables flexible image classification for a large range
of use cases. We evaluated GVL across three benchmarks-SpaceNet v7, UC Merced,
and RESISC45. It achieves up to 93.2% zero-shot accuracy on the binary
Buildings vs. No Buildings task on SpaceNet v7. For complex multi-class
classification tasks (UC Merced, RESISC45), we implemented a recursive
LLM-driven clustering to form meta-classes at successive depths, followed by
hierarchical classification-first resolving coarse groups, then finer
distinctions-to deliver competitive zero-shot performance. GVL is open-sourced
at https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler to catalyze adoption in
real-world geospatial workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像中情感线索的抽象性、重叠性和纠缠性使得建模和解释困难，且现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在情感语义对齐方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出K-EVER²框架，通过语义结构化的视觉情感线索表达和多模态对齐整合外部情感知识，无需手工标注或直接情感监督。

Result: 在Emotion6、EmoSet和M-Disaster三个基准测试中，K-EVER²显著优于CNN和VLM基线模型，最高提升19%的特定情感准确率和12.3%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: K-EVER²为视觉内容的情感理解提供了一种可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding what emotions images evoke in their viewers is a foundational
goal in human-centric visual computing. While recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for visual emotion analysis
(VEA), several key challenges remain unresolved. Emotional cues in images are
often abstract, overlapping, and entangled, making them difficult to model and
interpret. Moreover, VLMs struggle to align these complex visual patterns with
emotional semantics due to limited supervision and sparse emotional grounding.
Finally, existing approaches lack structured affective knowledge to resolve
ambiguity and ensure consistent emotional reasoning across diverse visual
domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{K-EVER\textsuperscript{2}},
a knowledge-enhanced framework for emotion reasoning and retrieval. Our
approach introduces a semantically structured formulation of visual emotion
cues and integrates external affective knowledge through multimodal alignment.
Without relying on handcrafted labels or direct emotion supervision,
K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} achieves robust and interpretable emotion predictions
across heterogeneous image types.
  We validate our framework on three representative benchmarks, Emotion6,
EmoSet, and M-Disaster, covering social media imagery, human-centric scenes,
and disaster contexts. K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} consistently outperforms
strong CNN and VLM baselines, achieving up to a \textbf{19\% accuracy gain} for
specific emotions and a \textbf{12.3\% average accuracy gain} across all
emotion categories. Our results demonstrate a scalable and generalizable
solution for advancing emotional understanding of visual content.

Conclusion: 该方法在联邦学习和隐私保护环境下有效，为医疗基础模型的训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract
abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve
patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI
diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with
labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising
solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned
for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for
medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected
nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training
typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large
volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making
foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we
propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy
imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while
contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms,
assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on
task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three
critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and
demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated,
privacy-preserving setting.

both masking and intention analysis are essential for a robust safety-utility

Motivation: 现有方法依赖全面的3D数据输入（如点云或BEV地图），限制了应用范围。本研究旨在直接从视频数据中提取3D信息，提升MLLMs的3D理解能力。

Method: 提出VG LLM方法，使用3D视觉几何编码器从视频序列中提取3D先验信息，并将其与视觉标记结合输入MLLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3D任务中表现显著提升，4B模型在不依赖显式3D输入的情况下，性能与现有SOTA方法相当，甚至在某些评估中超越Gemini-1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: VG LLM方法通过视频数据直接实现3D理解和推理，为3D场景分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as
videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such
as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research,
we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and
reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional
3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large
Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that
extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is
integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have
shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks
related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned
from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit
3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the
VSI-Bench evaluations.

Motivation: 云光学厚度（COT）对地球气候和辐射预算至关重要，但传统方法（如IPA）和现有深度学习模型在准确估计COT时存在偏差和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于注意力机制和角度编码的深度模型CAAC，结合多角度训练策略，以考虑卫星视角几何和3D辐射传输效应。

Result: 实验表明，CAAC显著优于现有最先进的深度学习模型，将云属性检索误差降低了至少九倍。

Conclusion: CAAC通过结合注意力机制和多角度训练，实现了更准确的COT估计，为云属性研究提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) is a critical cloud property influencing
Earth's climate, weather, and radiation budget. Satellite radiance measurements
enable global COT retrieval, but challenges like 3D cloud effects, viewing
angles, and atmospheric interference must be addressed to ensure accurate
estimation. Traditionally, the Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA) method,
which treats individual pixels independently, has been used for COT estimation.
However, IPA introduces significant bias due to its simplified assumptions.
Recently, deep learning-based models have shown improved performance over IPA
but lack robustness, as they are sensitive to variations in radiance intensity,
distortions, and cloud shadows. These models also introduce substantial errors
in COT estimation under different solar and viewing zenith angles. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel angle-invariant, attention-based deep
model called Cloud-Attention-Net with Angle Coding (CAAC). Our model leverages
attention mechanisms and angle embeddings to account for satellite viewing
geometry and 3D radiative transfer effects, enabling more accurate retrieval of
COT. Additionally, our multi-angle training strategy ensures angle invariance.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CAAC significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning models, reducing cloud
property retrieval errors by at least a factor of nine.

Motivation: 当前扩散模型采样方法主要依赖一阶Langevin动力学，而利用二阶Hessian几何虽能提升质量，但计算复杂度高。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出LML方法，通过低秩近似扩散Hessian几何和阻尼机制，避免显式计算高复杂度，并稳定近似结果。

Result: 实验表明，LML方法显著提升了图像生成质量，且计算开销几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: LML方法为扩散模型提供了一种高效利用Hessian几何的途径，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated the remarkable capability of
generating images via learning the noised score function of data distribution.
Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics
at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level
denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry
to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in
high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs,
rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel
Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion
Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the
celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces
two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian,
leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit
quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the
approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the
diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image
generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate
the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence
property of the damping mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple
pretrained DMs validate that the LML method significantly improves image
generation quality, with negligible computational overhead.

Result: BIMA在POPE基准测试中平均F1得分为85.06%，并显著降低了CHAIRS和CHAIRI指标（分别减少7.6%和2.6%）。

Conclusion: BIMA是首批利用双射方法减少视觉语言模型幻觉的研究之一，效果显著。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have become widely adopted to advance in various
domains. However, developing a trustworthy system with minimal interpretable
characteristics of large-scale models presents a significant challenge. One of
the most prevalent terms associated with the fallacy functions caused by these
systems is hallucination, where the language model generates a response that
does not correspond to the visual content. To mitigate this problem, several
approaches have been developed, and one prominent direction is to ameliorate
the decoding process. In this paper, we propose a new Bijective Maximum
Likelihood Learning (BIMA) approach to hallucination mitigation using
normalizing flow theories. The proposed BIMA method can efficiently mitigate
the hallucination problem in prevailing vision-language models, resulting in
significant improvements. Notably, BIMA achieves the average F1 score of 85.06%
on POPE benchmark and remarkably reduce CHAIRS and CHAIRI by 7.6% and 2.6%,
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies
that contemplates the bijection means to reduce hallucination induced by large
vision-language models.

Abstract: Multimodal hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
restricts the correctness of MLLMs. However, multimodal hallucinations are
multi-sourced and arise from diverse causes. Existing benchmarks fail to
adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and
reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue
and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To
address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning
hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly
perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces
multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination
score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model
scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of
logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no
effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted
spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities;
and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns,
highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To
address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines
curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate
logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and
collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method}
establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in
original base models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to
produce high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models
often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects,
attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I
models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the
nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we
introduce LongBench-T2I, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500
intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation
dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow
complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework
(Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without
requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with
existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose
complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As
existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the
nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that
automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of
multi-dimensional metrics. The data and code are released at

Motivation: 揭示LLMs在视觉层次知识上的不足，探讨其对视觉LLMs理解能力的限制。

Method: 使用六种分类学和四种图像数据集构建约100万道四选一视觉问答任务，并对视觉LLM进行微调。

Result: 微调后，LLMs的层次一致性提升多于视觉LLMs，进一步证实了LLMs的瓶颈效应。

Conclusion: 视觉LLMs无法完全实现层次化视觉理解，除非LLMs具备相应的分类学知识。

Abstract: This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even
well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck
for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone
Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million
four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six
taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM
using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because
the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision
LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual
concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy
knowledge.

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of
remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising
methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes
and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited
interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient
attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of
regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in
conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose
a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network
(STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the
non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a
sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by
non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness.
Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which
all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the
advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and
successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and
STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的强化学习框架（RLVR），通过优化数据集混合策略提升模型的泛化与推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态任务具有复杂性和异构性，传统RLVR方法难以直接应用，需解决数据集混合中的冲突目标问题。

Method: 开发了多模态RLVR框架，提出基于预测的数据混合策略，优化数据集组合以提高模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，优化的数据混合策略显著提升模型泛化能力，在分布外基准测试中准确率平均提升5.24%，总提升达20.74%。

Conclusion: 多域RLVR训练结合数据混合策略可有效增强MLLM的推理能力，为多模态任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving
state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers.
Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but
is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks
that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such,
training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates
challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets,
highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve
generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework
for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation
and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR
framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains
different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online
RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture
strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data
mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.
Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when
combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM
general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained
model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%
compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a
total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

TL;DR: ProxyThinker是一种无需训练的推理时技术，通过调整解码动态，使大型模型继承小型视觉推理器的能力，显著提升视觉推理性能，并实现高效并行推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化微调（RFT）能提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的视觉推理能力，但其计算成本高昂，限制了模型规模的扩展。

Method: 通过从RFT推理器的输出分布中减去基础模型的输出分布，ProxyThinker调整解码动态，激发自我验证和自我修正等复杂行为。

Result: ProxyThinker在空间、数学和多学科推理等挑战性视觉基准上显著提升性能，且推理速度比之前的方法快38倍。

Conclusion: ProxyThinker为无需训练的视觉推理能力继承提供了高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have
pushed the boundaries of the visual reasoning capabilities in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge
to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time
technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning
capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training.
By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT
reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits
the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors
such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts
performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and
multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the
performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our
implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with
parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared
to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment
of ProxyThinker. Code is available at

Motivation: 尽管链式思维推理和强化学习在NLP中取得了突破，但在生成视觉模型中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先通过监督微调赋予自回归图像生成器文本推理能力，然后使用Group Relative Policy Optimization优化输出。

Result: 在GenEval、DPG和T2I基准测试中，ReasonGen-R1表现优于基线模型和现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: ReasonGen-R1展示了文本推理与视觉生成的结合潜力，为生成模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have
driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models
remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that
first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based
"thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning
dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group
Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before
generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model
crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of
object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward
signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual
quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and
the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong
baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

TL;DR: Agent-X是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估视觉中心代理在多步和深度推理能力方面的表现，覆盖多种真实世界任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常局限于合成、单轮查询和单一视觉模态，缺乏评估多步推理质量的框架，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入Agent-X基准，包含828个任务，涵盖多种视觉环境和工具使用，并提出细粒度的步级评估框架。

Result: 即使最佳模型（如GPT、Gemini和Qwen）在多步视觉任务中的成功率也低于50%，揭示了当前模型的瓶颈。

Conclusion: Agent-X为视觉中心代理推理模型的研究提供了重要基准，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in
vision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding.
However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic,
single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess
reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To
address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,
multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual
contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional
text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual
reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,
and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with
explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we
propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the
correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness
of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the
best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to
solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.
These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use
capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic
reasoning models. Our data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAC的新框架，用于增强开放集半监督学习（SSL）的鲁棒性，通过利用多个模型对未标记数据的预测差异来检测异常值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SSL假设标记和未标记数据共享相同的类别分布，但实践中未标记数据常包含异常值（未知类别），导致模型性能下降。现有方法依赖单一模型的预测差异，在标记数据不足时效果不佳。

Method: DAC通过单一训练过程构建多个具有不同偏见的模型，利用这些模型对未标记数据的预测差异来检测异常值。

Result: 该方法在标记数据不足时仍能有效检测异常值，性能优于传统SSL和现有开放集SSL方法。

Conclusion: DAC通过利用模型间的预测差异，显著提升了开放集SSL的鲁棒性，尤其在标记数据不足的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and
unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, however in practice, this
assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class
data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading
the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the
context of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that
existing open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers
and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be
easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance
degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In
contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models
that are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging
the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables
robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key
contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through
a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently
biased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we
exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown
concepts. Our code is available at https://github.com/heejokong/DivCon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积对邻近像素贡献均一化，无法根据距离调整权重，限制了精度提升。

Method: 提出加权卷积框架，分离优化卷积核权重和密度函数，分别使用随机梯度下降和DIRECT-L算法。

Result: 在图像去噪任务中，加权卷积显著降低损失（提升53%），并提高测试精度，但增加11%执行时间。

Conclusion: 加权卷积在精度上有显著优势，未来将应用于2D和3D图像学习问题。

Abstract: The paper introduces the weighted convolution, a novel approach to the
convolution for signals defined on regular grids (e.g., 2D images) through the
application of an optimal density function to scale the contribution of
neighbouring pixels based on their distance from the central pixel. This choice
differs from the traditional uniform convolution, which treats all neighbouring
pixels equally. Our weighted convolution can be applied to convolutional neural
network problems to improve the approximation accuracy. Given a convolutional
network, we define a framework to compute the optimal density function through
a minimisation model. The framework separates the optimisation of the
convolutional kernel weights (using stochastic gradient descent) from the
optimisation of the density function (using DIRECT-L). Experimental results on
a learning model for an image-to-image task (e.g., image denoising) show that
the weighted convolution significantly reduces the loss (up to 53% improvement)
and increases the test accuracy compared to standard convolution. While this
method increases execution time by 11%, it is robust across several
hyperparameters of the learning model. Future work will apply the weighted
convolution to real-case 2D and 3D image convolutional learning problems.

Motivation: 探讨地理空间FMs在实现全球可持续发展目标中的实际效用和对齐性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入SustainFM框架，通过多样任务（如资产财富预测和环境灾害检测）对FMs进行跨学科评估。

Result: FMs在多数任务中优于传统方法，但需综合评估转移性、泛化能力和能源效率；FMs为可持续发展挑战提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 呼吁从模型中心开发转向影响驱动部署，强调能源效率、领域适应性和伦理考量作为关键评估指标。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale, pre-trained AI systems that have
revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, and are now
advancing geospatial analysis and Earth Observation (EO). They promise improved
generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal
labeled data. However, despite the rapid proliferation of geospatial FMs, their
real-world utility and alignment with global sustainability goals remain
underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a comprehensive benchmarking framework
grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks
ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This
study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and
offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our
findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform
traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs
should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and
energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable
scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex
sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from
model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics
such as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical
considerations.

Motivation: 现有AI驱动的UI代理数据集和方法主要针对简单任务，无法满足专业工程工具的需求，因此需要开发更复杂的数据集。

Method: 通过自动化框架生成41K个带注释的CAD操作视频，提出VideoCADFormer模型学习UI交互，并设计VQA基准测试。

Result: VideoCADFormer在CAD交互学习中表现优于基线模型，揭示了视频UI理解中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: VideoCAD为复杂UI交互学习提供了重要资源，并展示了多模态和空间推理的挑战。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a time-consuming and complex process,
requiring precise, long-horizon user interactions with intricate 3D interfaces.
While recent advances in AI-driven user interface (UI) agents show promise,
most existing datasets and methods focus on short, low-complexity tasks in
mobile or web applications, failing to capture the demands of professional
engineering tools. In this work, we introduce VideoCAD, the first attempt at
engineering UI interaction learning for precision tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD
is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video
recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for
collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared
to existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order of magnitude higher complexity
in UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20x
longer time horizon than other datasets. We show two important downstream
applications of VideoCAD: learning UI interactions from professional precision
3D CAD tools and a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to
evaluate multimodal large language models' (LLM) spatial reasoning and video
understanding abilities. To learn the UI interactions, we propose
VideoCADFormer - a state-of-the-art model in learning CAD interactions directly
from video, which outperforms multiple behavior cloning baselines. Both
VideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key
challenges in the current state of video-based UI understanding, including the
need for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon dependencies.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视频时空关系理解方面取得进展，但在空间信息缺失时无法捕捉纯时间模式，这一局限性亟需解决。

Method: 通过SpookyBench基准测试，评估VLM在时间序列噪声帧中的表现，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 人类在SpookyBench中表现优异（98%准确率），而VLM表现极差（0%准确率），且低空间信噪比下模型时间理解能力退化更快。

Conclusion: VLM过度依赖空间特征，需开发新架构或训练范式以解耦时空依赖。SpookyBench的发布旨在推动时间模式识别研究，缩小人机视频理解差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides
in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial
information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal
patterns. We introduce $\textbf{SpookyBench}$, a benchmark where information is
encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural
phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly,
while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with
over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance
gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial
features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore,
when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),
temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception,
especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this
limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple
spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows
that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release
SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the
gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial
to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world,
including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading
recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the
first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset,
containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic
scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head
pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer
model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or
combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the
task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality.
Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types
of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in
constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism. Code, model, and
data will be public.

Abstract: Oceanographic forecasting impacts various sectors of society by supporting
environmental conservation and economic activities. Based on global circulation
models, traditional forecasting methods are computationally expensive and slow,
limiting their ability to provide rapid forecasts. Recent advances in deep
learning offer faster and more accurate predictions, although these data-driven
models are often trained with global data from numerical simulations, which may
not reflect reality. The emergence of such models presents great potential for
improving ocean prediction at a subregional domain. However, their ability to
predict fine-scale ocean processes, like mesoscale structures, remains largely
unknown. This work aims to adapt a graph neural network initially developed for
global weather forecasting to improve subregional ocean prediction,
specifically focusing on the Canary Current upwelling system. The model is
trained with satellite data and compared to state-of-the-art physical ocean
models to assess its performance in capturing ocean dynamics. Our results show
that the deep learning model surpasses traditional methods in precision despite
some challenges in upwelling areas. It demonstrated superior performance in
reducing RMSE errors compared to ConvLSTM and the GLORYS reanalysis,
particularly in regions with complex oceanic dynamics such as Cape Ghir, Cape
Bojador, and Cape Blanc. The model achieved improvements of up to 26.5%
relative to ConvLSTM and error reductions of up to 76% in 5-day forecasts
compared to the GLORYS reanalysis at these critical locations, highlighting its
enhanced capability to capture spatial variability and improve predictive
accuracy in complex areas. These findings suggest the viability of adapting
meteorological data-driven models for improving subregional medium-term ocean
forecasting.

Method: 在无信息条件下证明公平分配的困难性；在已知归一化估值或未来物品价值频率预测时，设计算法实现更强的公平性。

Result: 无信息条件下公平分配几乎不可能；在特定信息条件下，提出的算法能实现更强的公平性，甚至匹配离线公平性结果。

Conclusion: 未来信息的不确定性限制了公平分配，但通过结构化信息可以显著提升在线公平分配的效果。

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in an
online setting, where goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated
irrevocably to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of
envy-freeness, proportionality, and maximin share fairness (and their
approximate variants), we ask how the availability of information on future
goods influences the existence and approximability of fair allocations. In the
absence of any such information, we establish strong impossibility results,
demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness
guarantees. In contrast, we demonstrate that knowledge of additional
information -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations
(equivalently, normalized valuations) or the multiset of future goods values
(frequency predictions) -- would enable the design of fairer online algorithms.
Given normalization information, we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger
fairness guarantees than previously known results. Given frequency predictions,
we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages frequency predictions to match the
best-known offline guarantees for a broad class of ''share-based'' fairness
notions. Our complementary impossibility results in each setting underscore
both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future goods and the
potential of leveraging structured information to achieve fairer outcomes in
online fair division.

Abstract: On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization
with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet,
achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from
real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open
challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for
learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified
learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this
work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these
challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot
learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area
overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are
efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the
first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and
inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free
compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art
inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$
higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records
on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way
5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots),
while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech
Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.

### [396] [More-than-Human Storytelling: Designing Longitudinal Narrative Engagements with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23780)
*Émilie Fabre,Katie Seaborn,Shuta Koiwai,Mizuki Watanabe,Paul Riesch*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户与生成式AI（GenAI）叙事代理的长期互动，发现用户对AI的创造性和反思机会表示欣赏，但对叙事连贯性和控制的局限性感到沮丧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多代用户与AI叙事代理的长期互动体验，填补生成式AI在叙事领域的空白。

Method: 采用为期两周的日记研究，28名参与者通过“Dreamsmithy”应用与AI叙述者“Makoto”共同创作故事，并进行反思性主题分析。

Result: 研究发现用户与AI之间存在复杂的动态关系，如“摇摆的矛盾心理”和“社会时间性联结”，同时揭示了AI叙事的优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究强调了GenAI在长期叙事中的潜力，但也提出了关于用户代理和伦理的关键问题，为未来设计适应性更强的叙事系统提供了初步见解。

Abstract: Longitudinal engagement with generative AI (GenAI) storytelling agents is a
timely but less charted domain. We explored multi-generational experiences with
"Dreamsmithy," a daily dream-crafting app, where participants (N = 28)
co-created stories with AI narrator "Makoto" every day. Reflections and
interactions were captured through a two-week diary study. Reflexive thematic
analysis revealed themes likes "oscillating ambivalence" and
"socio-chronological bonding," highlighting the complex dynamics that emerged
between individuals and the AI narrator over time. Findings suggest that while
people appreciated the personal notes, opportunities for reflection, and AI
creativity, limitations in narrative coherence and control occasionally caused
frustration. The results underscore the potential of GenAI for longitudinal
storytelling, but also raise critical questions about user agency and ethics.
We contribute initial empirical insights and design considerations for
developing adaptive, more-than-human storytelling systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合数字孪生的混合框架，以解决众包平台中生成式AI工具对数据真实性和工人角色的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 众包平台（如Amazon Mechanical Turk和Prolific）对研究至关重要，但工人使用生成式AI工具可能导致数据真实性下降和工人角色弱化。

Method: 提出了一种基于数字孪生的混合框架，通过个性化AI模型模拟工人行为，同时保持人类参与。实验（n=88）和深度访谈（n=9）验证了该框架。

Result: 数字孪生可提高生产力、减少决策疲劳，同时保持响应质量。研究者和工人均强调透明度、伦理数据使用和工人自主权的重要性。

Conclusion: 数字孪生通过自动化重复任务并保留人类参与复杂任务，有助于在可扩展性和真实性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific are vital for
research, yet workers' growing use of generative AI tools poses challenges.
Researchers face compromised data validity as AI responses replace authentic
human behavior, while workers risk diminished roles as AI automates tasks. To
address this, we propose a hybrid framework using digital twins, personalized
AI models that emulate workers' behaviors and preferences while keeping humans
in the loop. We evaluate our system with an experiment (n=88 crowd workers) and
in-depth interviews with crowd workers (n=5) and social science researchers
(n=4). Our results suggest that digital twins may enhance productivity and
reduce decision fatigue while maintaining response quality. Both researchers
and workers emphasized the importance of transparency, ethical data use, and
worker agency. By automating repetitive tasks and preserving human engagement
for nuanced ones, digital twins may help balance scalability with authenticity.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: WikiGap系统通过多语言信息差距发现方法和用户中心设计，在英文维基百科界面中展示其他语言版本的补充信息，显著提高了信息查找效率和用户意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英文维基百科在全球知识获取中占据主导地位，但其他语言版本包含的文化和媒体环境相关的补充信息被边缘化。当前的语言切换系统未充分展示这些信息。

Method: 结合多语言信息差距发现方法和用户中心设计，开发WikiGap系统，支持从法文、俄文和中文维基百科获取补充信息。

Result: 在21人的混合方法研究中，WikiGap显著提高了信息查找准确性，减少了任务时间，并获得了比现有系统高32分的可用性评分。

Conclusion: WikiGap提升了用户对非英文维基百科补充信息的意识，促进了跨语言版本的知识公平。

Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next, English Wikipedia
dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers
are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions,
leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English.
Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their
respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English
Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language
editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to
readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary
information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts
sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface.
Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery
method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary
information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods
study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced
task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to
Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported
increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in
non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia.
WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language
editions.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的基于CVAE的人声到非人声转换（H2NH-VC）方法，支持更广泛的非语音声音（如狮子吼叫、鸟鸣等）和高质量44.1kHz音频转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在狗叫声和低质量音频转换上，本文旨在扩展非语音声音的范围并提升转换质量。

Method: 提出了一种预处理流程和改进的CVAE模型，优化了人声和非人声的转换。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量、自然度和相似度MOS评分上优于基线，实现了多样非人声音色的有效转换。

Conclusion: 该方法在H2NH-VC任务中表现出色，支持更广泛的非语音声音和高质量音频转换。

Abstract: Human to non-human voice conversion (H2NH-VC) transforms human speech into
animal or designed vocalizations. Unlike prior studies focused on dog-sounds
and 16 or 22.05kHz audio transformation, this work addresses a broader range of
non-speech sounds, including natural sounds (lion-roars, birdsongs) and
designed voice (synthetic growls). To accomodate generation of diverse
non-speech sounds and 44.1kHz high-quality audio transformation, we introduce a
preprocessing pipeline and an improved CVAE-based H2NH-VC model, both optimized
for human and non-human voices. Experimental results showed that the proposed
method outperformed baselines in quality, naturalness, and similarity MOS,
achieving effective voice conversion across diverse non-human timbres. Demo

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反欺骗研究忽视情感多样性，导致对高质量情感合成语音的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 引入EmoSpoof-TTS数据集，并提出GEM（基于情感专用模型的集成方法）。

Result: 现有模型在情感语音上表现不佳，GEM在所有情感和中性状态下均有效。

Conclusion: 需关注情感反欺骗范式，GEM为解决方案，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Traditional anti-spoofing focuses on models and datasets built on synthetic
speech with mostly neutral state, neglecting diverse emotional variations. As a
result, their robustness against high-quality, emotionally expressive synthetic
speech is uncertain. We address this by introducing EmoSpoof-TTS, a corpus of
emotional text-to-speech samples. Our analysis shows existing anti-spoofing
models struggle with emotional synthetic speech, exposing risks of
emotion-targeted attacks. Even trained on emotional data, the models
underperform due to limited focus on emotional aspect and show performance
disparities across emotions. This highlights the need for emotion-focused
anti-spoofing paradigm in both dataset and methodology. We propose GEM, a gated
ensemble of emotion-specialized models with a speech emotion recognition gating
network. GEM performs effectively across all emotions and neutral state,
improving defenses against spoofing attacks. We release the EmoSpoof-TTS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重音在编码意义和辅助语音理解中起重要作用，但以往研究多依赖传统声学特征和英语数据集，本文旨在探索更高效的方法。

Method: 微调预训练的Transformer模型，并添加音频帧分类头，使用克罗地亚语训练数据集，并在克罗地亚语、塞尔维亚语、查克维亚方言和斯洛文尼亚语中测试。

Result: Transformer模型在所有测试语言中表现优异，克罗地亚语和塞尔维亚语接近完美，查克维亚方言和斯洛文尼亚语性能下降10%。仅需数百个多音节训练词即可实现强性能。

Conclusion: 微调Transformer模型在重音识别任务中优于传统方法，且数据需求较少，研究结果和模型已开源。

Abstract: Automating primary stress identification has been an active research field
due to the role of stress in encoding meaning and aiding speech comprehension.
Previous studies relied mainly on traditional acoustic features and English
datasets. In this paper, we investigate the approach of fine-tuning a
pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head. Our
experiments use a new Croatian training dataset, with test sets in Croatian,
Serbian, the Chakavian dialect, and Slovenian. By comparing an SVM classifier
using traditional acoustic features with the fine-tuned speech transformer, we
demonstrate the transformer's superiority across the board, achieving
near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian, with a 10-point performance drop
for the more distant Chakavian and Slovenian. Finally, we show that only a few
hundred multi-syllabic training words suffice for strong performance. We
release our datasets and model under permissive licenses.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人口统计学（性别、年龄、教育）和个体因素如何影响对话中的轮流行为，发现个体差异和对话双方关系对轮流行为的影响大于人口统计学因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的轮流行为受普遍约束但也存在显著差异，研究旨在揭示人口统计学和个体因素如何塑造这种行为。

Method: 使用美国英语对话大数据集（Fisher），分析过渡地板偏移（TFO），考察性别、年龄、教育等因素的影响。

Result: 性别和年龄对TFO有微小但显著影响（女性及年长者偏移较短），教育无影响。个体差异影响更大，尤其是对话双方关系。

Conclusion: 对话双方关系和共同活动是TFO的最强决定因素，超越人口统计学影响。

Abstract: Turn-taking in dialogue follows universal constraints but also varies
significantly. This study examines how demographic (sex, age, education) and
individual factors shape turn-taking using a large dataset of US English
conversations (Fisher). We analyze Transition Floor Offset (TFO) and find
notable interspeaker variation. Sex and age have small but significant effects
female speakers and older individuals exhibit slightly shorter offsets - while
education shows no effect. Lighter topics correlate with shorter TFOs. However,
individual differences have a greater impact, driven by a strong idiosyncratic
and an even stronger "dyadosyncratic" component - speakers in a dyad resemble
each other more than they resemble themselves in different dyads. This suggests
that the dyadic relationship and joint activity are the strongest determinants
of TFO, outweighing demographic influences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对部分标记目标数据集的多输出分类框架，用于旋转机械复合故障诊断，通过跨任务信息共享和频率层归一化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转机械的复杂性和多样化工况（如转速和变扭矩）增加了复合故障诊断的挑战，尤其是在需要领域适应的场景中。

Method: 提出多输出分类框架，探索单任务和多任务架构，引入跨任务层结构和频率层归一化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在六种领域适应场景中表现优于基线模型，尤其在复合故障设置中优势明显。

Conclusion: 模型的改进主要源于其结构能力，而非参数增加，频率层归一化更适合故障诊断任务。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of
operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have
amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain
adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these
challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework
tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets.
Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed
MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously.
Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures
applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based
designs-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this
investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables
selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing
classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition,
frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation
performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented
using a motor-based test setup, and the proposed model was evaluated across six
domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior
macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the
proposed mode's structural advantage is more pronounced in compound fault
settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer
normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods.
Lastly, we discuss that this improvement primarily stems from the model's
structural ability to leverage inter-fault classification task interactions,
rather than from a simple increase in model parameters.

Motivation: 开发通用可穿戴实时跌倒检测系统对健康工人（如工业工人）仍具挑战性，尤其是在恶劣环境中。

Method: 使用倒立摆动态模型模拟跌倒，生成训练数据，输入深度学习框架以激活跌倒缓解机制。

Result: 该方法能高效生成大量不同初始条件下的训练数据，适用于特定类型的跌倒（初始配置变化不大）。

Conclusion: 这是迈向通用可穿戴设备的第一步，旨在减少工业环境中的跌倒伤害，提高工人安全性。

Abstract: Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is
still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as
industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a
hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model
of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to
a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation
mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach
is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for
thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions,
something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach
is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without
changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step
toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing
fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the
safety of workers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字技术的普及，网络犯罪日益猖獗，对个人和组织构成严重威胁，亟需研究其预防策略和安全措施。

Abstract: Since the 1990s, the integration of technology into daily life has led to the
creation of an extensive network of interconnected devices, transforming how
individuals and organizations operate. However, this digital transformation has
also spurred the rise of cybercrime, criminal activities perpetrated through
networks or computer systems. Cybercrime has become a global concern,
presenting significant challenges to security systems. Although advancements in
digital technology have enhanced efficiency, they have also opened new avenues
for exploitation by cybercriminals, highlighting the urgent need for advanced
cybersecurity measures. The escalating number of cyberattacks and associated
risks in the past decade highlights the critical importance of protecting
sensitive data and safeguarding information systems. Cybercrimes range from
financial fraud and phishing scams to identity theft and online harassment,
posing substantial risks to both individuals and organizations. In response,
governments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity units have intensified
their efforts to address these threats. In recent years, India has experienced
a significant surge in cybercrime incidents, with a notable increase in cases
involving ransomware, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. The
growing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the
rapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and
organizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include
banking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due
to the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there
is an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust
regulatory frameworks. This paper examines cybercrime, prevention strategies,
security protocols, and terminology to safeguard digital infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对GGUF量化方法的首次攻击，利用量化误差构造恶意量化模型，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型规模的增大，后训练量化成为内存高效部署的标准方法。然而，现有攻击无法应用于复杂量化方法（如GGUF），本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过量化误差构造恶意量化模型，训练目标恶意模型并约束其权重。

Result: 在三种攻击场景中，攻击成功率分别为88.7%（不安全代码生成）、85.0%（目标内容注入）和30.1%（良性指令拒绝）。

Conclusion: GGUF量化方法易受对抗性干扰，仅依赖量化复杂性不足以防御攻击。

Abstract: With the increasing size of frontier LLMs, post-training quantization has
become the standard for memory-efficient deployment. Recent work has shown that
basic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be
exploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain
hidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more
complex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular
ollama and llama.cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization
error -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their
(de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct
malicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging
this, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while
constraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization
data types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation
($\Delta$=$88.7\%$), targeted content injection ($\Delta$=$85.0\%$), and benign
instruction refusal ($\Delta$=$30.1\%$). Our attack highlights that (1) the
most widely used post-training quantization method is susceptible to
adversarial interferences, and (2) the complexity of quantization schemes alone
is insufficient as a defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管联邦学习旨在保护客户数据隐私，但其分布式特性使其容易受到模型提取攻击，威胁知识产权安全。

Method: 在NVFlare平台下构建不同联邦客户端，实施两种模型提取攻击，评估攻击性能（如准确率、保真度和KL散度），并探索基于迁移学习的攻击方法。

Result: 实验表明，提取模型的准确率和保真度与攻击查询集大小密切相关；基于迁移学习的攻击方法在小查询集下表现更优。

Conclusion: 联邦学习对模型提取攻击具有显著脆弱性，迁移学习方法为攻击者提供了潜在优势，需加强防御措施。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework designed to
protect client data, yet it remains highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property
(IP) threats. Model extraction (ME) attacks pose a significant risk to Machine
Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, enabling attackers to replicate
confidential models by querying black-box (without internal insight) APIs.
Despite FL's privacy-preserving goals, its distributed nature makes it
particularly susceptible to such attacks. This paper examines the vulnerability
of FL-based victim models to two types of model extraction attacks. For various
federated clients built under the NVFlare platform, we implemented ME attacks
across two deep learning architectures and three image datasets. We evaluate
the proposed ME attack performance using various metrics, including accuracy,
fidelity, and KL divergence. The experiments show that for different FL
clients, the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted model are closely related
to the size of the attack query set. Additionally, we explore a transfer
learning based approach where pretrained models serve as the starting point for
the extraction process. The results indicate that the accuracy and fidelity of
the fine-tuned pretrained extraction models are notably higher, particularly
with smaller query sets, highlighting potential advantages for attackers.

Conclusion: 论文为基于基础模型的安全、智能和可信物联网基础设施提供了研究路线图，并指出了未来的挑战。

Abstract: This paper focuses on Zero-Trust Foundation Models (ZTFMs), a novel paradigm
that embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation
models (FMs) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By integrating core tenets,
such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data
confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and
deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across
distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial IoT environments. We
present the first structured synthesis of ZTFMs, identifying their potential to
transform conventional trust-based IoT architectures into resilient,
self-defending ecosystems. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive technical
framework, incorporating federated learning (FL), blockchain-based identity
management, micro-segmentation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to
support decentralized, verifiable intelligence at the network edge. In
addition, we investigate emerging security threats unique to ZTFM-enabled
systems and evaluate countermeasures, such as anomaly detection, adversarial
training, and secure aggregation. Through this analysis, we highlight key open
research challenges in terms of scalability, secure orchestration,
interpretable threat attribution, and dynamic trust calibration. This survey
lays a foundational roadmap for secure, intelligent, and trustworthy IoT
infrastructures powered by FMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了统一安全基准（USB），以解决现有多模态大语言模型（MLLM）安全评估中的数据质量、覆盖范围和模态组合不足的问题，同时兼顾对有害查询的脆弱性和对无害查询的过度敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM安全评估基准在数据质量、覆盖范围和模态组合方面存在不足，导致评估结果不准确，阻碍了安全问题的发现和治理。此外，对有害查询的脆弱性和对无害查询的过度敏感性需同时评估。

Method: 设计了统一安全基准（USB），结合开源数据集和合成数据，覆盖61个风险子类别和4种模态组合，支持中英文，并同时评估脆弱性和过度敏感性。

Result: USB是当前最全面的MLLM安全评估基准，填补了现有基准的不足，提供了更全面的风险类别和模态组合覆盖。

Conclusion: USB为MLLM安全评估提供了更全面和准确的工具，有助于发现和治理安全问题。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable achievements and widespread adoption, Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revealed significant security
vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust safety evaluation
benchmarks. Existing MLLM safety benchmarks, however, fall short in terms of
data quality and coverge, and modal risk combinations, resulting in inflated
and contradictory evaluation results, which hinders the discovery and
governance of security concerns. Besides, we argue that vulnerabilities to
harmful queries and oversensitivity to harmless ones should be considered
simultaneously in MLLMs safety evaluation, whereas these were previously
considered separately. In this paper, to address these shortcomings, we
introduce Unified Safety Benchmarks (USB), which is one of the most
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks in MLLM safety. Our benchmark features
high-quality queries, extensive risk categories, comprehensive modal
combinations, and encompasses both vulnerability and oversensitivity
evaluations. From the perspective of two key dimensions: risk categories and
modality combinations, we demonstrate that the available benchmarks -- even the
union of the vast majority of them -- are far from being truly comprehensive.
To bridge this gap, we design a sophisticated data synthesis pipeline that
generates extensive, high-quality complementary data addressing previously
unexplored aspects. By combining open-source datasets with our synthetic data,

*Yinuo Xue,Eric Spero,Yun Sing Koh,Giovanni Russello*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MultiPhishGuard是一种基于动态LLM的多代理检测系统，通过协同专家知识和对抗性强化学习，显著提升钓鱼邮件检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼邮件检测面临对抗性策略和异构攻击模式的挑战，传统方法和机器学习难以适应新型钓鱼策略。

Method: 采用五个协作代理（文本、URL、元数据、解释简化器和对抗代理），结合近端策略优化强化学习算法，并引入对抗训练循环。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MultiPhishGuard准确率达97.89%，误报率2.73%，漏报率0.20%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过动态多代理协作和生成对抗性防御，MultiPhishGuard显著提升了钓鱼邮件的检测能力。

Abstract: Phishing email detection faces critical challenges from evolving adversarial
tactics and heterogeneous attack patterns. Traditional detection methods, such
as rule-based filters and denylists, often struggle to keep pace with these
evolving tactics, leading to false negatives and compromised security. While
machine learning approaches have improved detection accuracy, they still face
challenges adapting to novel phishing strategies. We present MultiPhishGuard, a
dynamic LLM-based multi-agent detection system that synergizes specialized
expertise with adversarial-aware reinforcement learning. Our framework employs
five cooperative agents (text, URL, metadata, explanation simplifier, and
adversarial agents) with automatically adjusted decision weights powered by a
Proximal Policy Optimization reinforcement learning algorithm. To address
emerging threats, we introduce an adversarial training loop featuring an
adversarial agent that generates subtle context-aware email variants, creating
a self-improving defense ecosystem and enhancing system robustness.
Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard
significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thoughts, single-agent baselines and
state-of-the-art detectors, as validated by ablation studies and comparative
analyses. Experiments demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard achieves high accuracy
(97.89\%) with low false positive (2.73\%) and false negative rates (0.20\%).
Additionally, we incorporate an explanation simplifier agent, which provides
users with clear and easily understandable explanations for why an email is
classified as phishing or legitimate. This work advances phishing defense
through dynamic multi-agent collaboration and generative adversarial
resilience.

*Akram Sheriff,Ken Huang,Zsolt Nemeth,Madjid Nakhjiri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了自适应防御代理（ADA），一种创新的自动化移动目标防御（AMTD）系统，旨在通过持续旋转Kubernetes工作负载来增强AI工作负载的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态防御依赖复杂昂贵的可信计算解决方案，而ADA通过主动环境操纵提供更高效的安全模型。

Method: ADA利用Kubernetes的短暂性，持续销毁和重建AI服务实例，破坏攻击者的假设和攻击链。

Result: ADA提供了一种更强大、灵活且操作高效的零信任模型，支持最新的AI生态系统。

Conclusion: ADA通过主动防御而非被动修补，为AI服务提供了更安全的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Defense Agent (ADA), an innovative
Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) system designed to fundamentally enhance
the security posture of AI workloads. ADA operates by continuously and
automatically rotating these workloads at the infrastructure level, leveraging
the inherent ephemerality of Kubernetes pods. This constant managed churn
systematically invalidates attacker assumptions and disrupts potential kill
chains by regularly destroying and respawning AI service instances. This
methodology, applying principles of chaos engineering as a continuous,
proactive defense, offers a paradigm shift from traditional static defenses
that rely on complex and expensive confidential or trusted computing solutions
to secure the underlying compute platforms, while at the same time agnostically
supporting the latest advancements in agentic and nonagentic AI ecosystems and
solutions such as agent-to-agent (A2A) communication frameworks or model
context protocols (MCP). This AI-native infrastructure design, relying on the
widely proliferated cloud-native Kubernetes technologies, facilitates easier
deployment, simplifies maintenance through an inherent zero trust posture
achieved by rotation, and promotes faster adoption. We posit that ADA's novel
approach to AMTD provides a more robust, agile, and operationally efficient
zero-trust model for AI services, achieving security through proactive
environmental manipulation rather than reactive patching.

*Abhijit Talluri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DP-RTFL是一种先进的联邦学习框架，结合本地差分隐私和弹性时间状态管理，解决标准FL在容错、隐私和数据完整性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准联邦学习在容错性、系统弹性和隐私保障方面存在缺陷，可能导致训练中断、数据丢失或违规。

Method: DP-RTFL整合了本地差分隐私（LDP）、弹性时间状态管理和完整性验证机制（如ZKIPs）。

Result: 该框架适用于敏感数据（如金融信用评估），具有操作鲁棒性、可审计性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: DP-RTFL为关键应用提供了隐私保护、容错和完整性验证的解决方案，并已开源。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for enabling
privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in regulated sectors such as
finance and healthcare. However, standard FL strategies often encounter
significant operational challenges related to fault tolerance, system
resilience against concurrent client and server failures, and the provision of
robust, verifiable privacy guarantees essential for handling sensitive data.
These deficiencies can lead to training disruptions, data loss, compromised
model integrity, and non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g.,
GDPR, CCPA). This paper introduces Differentially Private Resilient Temporal
Federated Learning (DP-RTFL), an advanced FL framework designed to ensure
training continuity, precise state recovery, and strong data privacy. DP-RTFL
integrates local Differential Privacy (LDP) at the client level with resilient
temporal state management and integrity verification mechanisms, such as
hash-based commitments (referred to as Zero-Knowledge Integrity Proofs or ZKIPs
in this context). The framework is particularly suited for critical
applications like credit risk assessment using sensitive financial data, aiming
to be operationally robust, auditable, and scalable for enterprise AI
deployments. The implementation of the DP-RTFL framework is available as
open-source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM发展为跨组织边界的自主智能体，其在联合灾难响应、供应链优化等任务中的应用日益广泛，但跨领域协作打破了现有对齐和约束技术的统一信任假设，带来了新的安全风险。

Method: 本文是一篇立场论文，通过分析跨领域多智能体LLM系统的安全挑战，提出了七类新的安全问题，并为每类问题设计了可能的攻击方式、评估指标和研究方向。

Result: 研究识别了由多智能体动态引发的安全风险，如信息泄露或策略违反，并提出了相应的安全框架。

Conclusion: 跨领域多智能体LLM系统的安全研究亟待加强，本文为未来研究提供了明确的议程和方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents that
cooperate across organizational boundaries, enabling joint disaster response,
supply-chain optimization, and other tasks that demand decentralized expertise
without surrendering data ownership. Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters
the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment
techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an
untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by
emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This
position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM
systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each
of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and
future research guidelines.

TL;DR: CADRE是一个用于联邦学习的框架，允许用户自定义数据准备标准，确保数据质量和隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据准备不足的问题，同时保护隐私。

Method: 提出CADRE框架，支持用户定义数据准备标准、指标和补救措施，生成报告。

Result: 在六个数据集上验证了框架的有效性，解决了七种数据准备问题。

Conclusion: CADRE提升了联邦学习的性能和可靠性，提前解决了数据问题。

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine
learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL
preserves privacy and security of the client's data by not exchanging it.
However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for
federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this
paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data REadiness) for FL, a
novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR)
standards, metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. Our
framework generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics,
rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are optimally prepared for FL while
preserving privacy. We demonstrate the framework's practical application by
integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across
six diverse datasets, addressing seven different DR issues. The results
illustrate the framework's versatility and effectiveness in ensuring DR across
various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This
approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as
utilizes valuable resources by identifying and addressing data-related issues
before the training phase.

TL;DR: KGMARK是首个针对动态知识图谱的水印框架，通过聚类对齐和冗余嵌入策略解决时空变化问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法难以适应动态图谱的时空变化，需开发新框架保护知识产权。

Method: 提出聚类对齐方法适应空间变化，冗余嵌入策略增强时间变化鲁棒性，引入可学习掩码矩阵提升透明度。

Result: 实验表明KGMARK能有效应对结构化数据的动态变化。

Conclusion: KGMARK为动态知识图谱水印提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous in numerous real-world applications,
and watermarking facilitates protecting intellectual property and preventing
potential harm from AI-generated content. Existing watermarking methods mainly
focus on static plain text or image data, while they can hardly be applied to
dynamic graphs due to spatial and temporal variations of structured data. This
motivates us to propose KGMARK, the first graph watermarking framework that
aims to generate robust, detectable, and transparent diffusion fingerprints for
dynamic KG data. Specifically, we propose a novel clustering-based alignment
method to adapt the watermark to spatial variations. Meanwhile, we present a
redundant embedding strategy to harden the diffusion watermark against various
attacks, facilitating the robustness of the watermark to the temporal
variations. Additionally, we introduce a novel learnable mask matrix to improve
the transparency of diffusion fingerprints. By doing so, our KGMARK properly
tackles the variation challenges of structured data. Experiments on various
public benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed KGMARK.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型威胁：利用机器学习模型的谨慎预测机制进行歧视性行为，并提出了防御框架Confidential Guardian。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谨慎预测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但可能被恶意机构利用以不确定性为幌子进行歧视或拒绝服务。

Method: 提出Mirage攻击降低目标区域的置信度，并设计Confidential Guardian框架通过校准指标和零知识证明检测虚假置信度。

Result: Confidential Guardian能有效防止谨慎预测的滥用，确保不确定性反映真实模型行为。

Conclusion: Confidential Guardian为谨慎预测提供了可验证的保障，防止恶意利用。

Abstract: Cautious predictions -- where a machine learning model abstains when
uncertain -- are crucial for limiting harmful errors in safety-critical
applications. In this work, we identify a novel threat: a dishonest institution
can exploit these mechanisms to discriminate or unjustly deny services under
the guise of uncertainty. We demonstrate the practicality of this threat by
introducing an uncertainty-inducing attack called Mirage, which deliberately
reduces confidence in targeted input regions, thereby covertly disadvantaging
specific individuals. At the same time, Mirage maintains high predictive
performance across all data points. To counter this threat, we propose
Confidential Guardian, a framework that analyzes calibration metrics on a
reference dataset to detect artificially suppressed confidence. Additionally,
it employs zero-knowledge proofs of verified inference to ensure that reported
confidence scores genuinely originate from the deployed model. This prevents
the provider from fabricating arbitrary model confidence values while
protecting the model's proprietary details. Our results confirm that
Confidential Guardian effectively prevents the misuse of cautious predictions,
providing verifiable assurances that abstention reflects genuine model
uncertainty rather than malicious intent.

TL;DR: 论文主张在部署大型语言模型（LLM）代理时应用信息安全设计原则，以解决隐私泄露和系统漏洞问题，并提出了一个名为AgentSandbox的概念框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在自动化复杂任务方面表现出潜力，但多代理交互和上下文操纵带来的隐私和系统漏洞问题需要解决。

Method: 提出AgentSandbox框架，嵌入信息安全设计原则（如深度防御、最小权限等），并在最先进的LLM上进行评估。

Result: AgentSandbox在功能和对抗评估中保持高效，同时显著降低隐私风险。

Conclusion: 通过将安全设计原则嵌入LLM代理协议，可以构建可信的代理生态系统，满足隐私和监管要求。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show considerable promise for automating
complex tasks using contextual reasoning; however, interactions involving
multiple agents and the system's susceptibility to prompt injection and other
forms of context manipulation introduce new vulnerabilities related to privacy
leakage and system exploitation. This position paper argues that the
well-established design principles in information security, which are commonly
referred to as security principles, should be employed when deploying LLM
agents at scale. Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege,
complete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the
design of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five
decades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help
secure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox,
a conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide
safeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle. We evaluate with state-of-the-art
LLMs along three dimensions: benign utility, attack utility, and attack success
rate. AgentSandbox maintains high utility for its intended functions under both
benign and adversarial evaluations while substantially mitigating privacy
risks. By embedding secure design principles as foundational elements within
emerging LLM agent protocols, we aim to promote trustworthy agent ecosystems
aligned with user privacy expectations and evolving regulatory requirements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种奖励驱动的自动化WebShell恶意代码生成器（RAWG），用于红队应用，通过分类、标准化和强化学习生成多样化的高混淆恶意负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频繁的网络攻击使WebShell利用与防御成为网络安全研究重点，但现有恶意代码数据集和生成方法存在多样性不足和冗余度高的问题。

Method: RAWG首先将WebShell样本按混淆方法分类，利用LLM提取关键令牌并构建标准化语料库，通过监督微调和PPO优化生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，RAWG在负载多样性和逃逸效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAWG为红队应用提供了一种高效的恶意代码生成解决方案。

Abstract: Frequent cyber-attacks have elevated WebShell exploitation and defense to a
critical research focus within network security. However, there remains a
significant shortage of publicly available, well-categorized malicious-code
datasets organized by obfuscation method. Existing malicious-code generation
methods, which primarily rely on prompt engineering, often suffer from limited
diversity and high redundancy in the payloads they produce. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{RAWG}, a \textbf{R}eward-driven
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{W}ebshell Malicious-code \textbf{G}enerator designed
for red-teaming applications. Our approach begins by categorizing webshell
samples from common datasets into seven distinct types of obfuscation. We then
employ a large language model (LLM) to extract and normalize key tokens from
each sample, creating a standardized, high-quality corpus. Using this curated
dataset, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an open-source large model
to enable the generation of diverse, highly obfuscated webshell malicious
payloads. To further enhance generation quality, we apply Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), treating malicious-code samples as "chosen" data and benign
code as "rejected" data during reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RAWG significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in both payload diversity and escape effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LPASS的方法，利用线性探针（LPs）在压缩和微调前预估LLM性能，并确定层剪枝的截断点。实验表明，该方法在BERT和Gemma上高效且有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前压缩和微调LLM用于漏洞检测时计算成本高昂，需要一种早期性能预估方法以减少资源浪费。

Method: 使用线性探针（LPs）在压缩和微调前预估模型性能，并确定层剪枝的截断点。

Result: LPASS方法在BERT和Gemma上表现优异，能显著减少层数而不损失精度，且压缩后的Gemma模型性能优于原始模型。

Conclusion: LPASS提供了一种高效且有效的方法，显著降低了计算成本，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being extensively used for cybersecurity
purposes. One of them is the detection of vulnerable codes. For the sake of
efficiency and effectiveness, compression and fine-tuning techniques are being
developed, respectively. However, they involve spending substantial
computational efforts. In this vein, we analyse how Linear Probes (LPs) can be
used to provide an estimation on the performance of a compressed LLM at an
early phase -- before fine-tuning. We also show their suitability to set the
cut-off point when applying layer pruning compression. Our approach, dubbed
$LPASS$, is applied in BERT and Gemma for the detection of 12 of MITRE's Top 25
most dangerous vulnerabilities on 480k C/C++ samples. LPs can be computed in
142.97 s. and provide key findings: (1) 33.3 \% and 72.2\% of layers can be
removed, respectively, with no precision loss; (2) they provide an early
estimate of the post-fine-tuning and post-compression model effectiveness, with
3\% and 8.68\% as the lowest and average precision errors, respectively.
$LPASS$-based LLMs outperform the state of the art, reaching 86.9\% of accuracy
in multi-class vulnerability detection. Interestingly, $LPASS$-based compressed
versions of Gemma outperform the original ones by 1.6\% of F1-score at a
maximum while saving 29.4 \% and 23.8\% of training and inference time and
42.98\% of model size.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变色龙哈希的不可逆护照（CHIP）框架，用于保护大规模深度神经网络的IP，同时实现所有权验证、用户追踪和主动使用控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模深度神经网络（DNNs）的训练成本高昂，其知识产权（IP）保护至关重要。现有方法（如基于护照的水印技术）无法全面保护模型所有权、高保真度、主动使用授权和用户追踪。

Method: 利用密码学变色龙哈希函数，CHIP框架通过其抗碰撞特性实现强所有权声明和用户追踪，同时利用陷门碰撞特性实现多用户护照和许可证的哈希签名，以控制使用权限。

Result: 在四个数据集和两种架构上广泛评估，证明了CHIP的保护多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CHIP框架为离线分发模型和MLaaS提供了全面的IP保护解决方案，兼具所有权验证和用户追踪功能。

Abstract: The pervasion of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their enormous
training costs make their intellectual property (IP) protection of paramount
importance. Recently introduced passport-based methods attempt to steer DNN
watermarking towards strengthening ownership verification against ambiguity
attacks by modulating the affine parameters of normalization layers.
Unfortunately, neither watermarking nor passport-based methods provide a
holistic protection with robust ownership proof, high fidelity, active usage
authorization and user traceability for offline access distributed models and
multi-user Machine-Learning as a Service (MLaaS) cloud model. In this paper, we
propose a Chameleon Hash-based Irreversible Passport (CHIP) protection
framework that utilizes the cryptographic chameleon hash function to achieve
all these goals. The collision-resistant property of chameleon hash allows for
strong model ownership claim upon IP infringement and liable user traceability,
while the trapdoor-collision property enables hashing of multiple user
passports and licensee certificates to the same immutable signature to realize
active usage control. Using the owner passport as an oracle, multiple
user-specific triplets, each contains a passport-aware user model, a user
passport, and a licensee certificate can be created for secure offline
distribution. The watermarked master model can also be deployed for MLaaS with
usage permission verifiable by the provision of any trapdoor-colliding user
passports. CHIP is extensively evaluated on four datasets and two architectures
to demonstrate its protection versatility and robustness. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Dshm212/CHIP.

TL;DR: PatchDEMUX是一个可证明鲁棒的多标签分类框架，通过将多标签任务分解为多个二分类问题，扩展了单标签分类的可证明防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受对抗性补丁攻击，现有可证明防御方法主要针对单标签分类，多标签分类领域研究较少。

Method: 将多标签分类任务分解为多个独立的二分类问题，并基于单标签分类的可证明防御方法（如PatchCleanser）进行扩展。在攻击者仅能使用单个补丁时，提出额外的认证方法以提供更紧的鲁棒性边界。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，PatchDEMUX实现了非平凡的鲁棒性，同时保持了较高的干净性能。

Conclusion: PatchDEMUX为多标签分类提供了一种可证明鲁棒的通用框架，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have enabled vast improvements in computer vision
technologies. Nevertheless, these models are vulnerable to adversarial patch
attacks which catastrophically impair performance. The physically realizable
nature of these attacks calls for certifiable defenses, which feature provable
guarantees on robustness. While certifiable defenses have been successfully
applied to single-label classification, limited work has been done for
multi-label classification. In this work, we present PatchDEMUX, a certifiably
robust framework for multi-label classifiers against adversarial patches. Our
approach is a generalizable method which can extend any existing certifiable
defense for single-label classification; this is done by considering the
multi-label classification task as a series of isolated binary classification
problems to provably guarantee robustness. Furthermore, in the scenario where
an attacker is limited to a single patch we propose an additional certification
procedure that can provide tighter robustness bounds. Using the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-label certifiable defense PatchCleanser as a
backbone, we find that PatchDEMUX can achieve non-trivial robustness on the
MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets while maintaining high clean performance

methodology that integrates ESNs with transfer learning, aiming to enhance
predictive performance across various parameter regimes of the gKS model. Our
research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the
gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the
spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter
settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集部署的无线传感器和物联网网络中，厚尾噪声是常见且重要的干扰因素，现有方法无法有效处理。

Result: 在均方误差意义下收敛到解邻域，并可通过调整步长减小渐近误差。

Conclusion: 该方法对厚尾噪声具有鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We consider a standard distributed optimization problem in which networked
nodes collaboratively minimize the sum of their locally known convex costs. For
this setting, we address for the first time the fundamental problem of design
and analysis of distributed methods to solve the above problem when inter-node
communication is subject to \emph{heavy-tailed} noise. Heavy-tailed noise is
highly relevant and frequently arises in densely deployed wireless sensor and
Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we design a distributed
gradient-type method that features a carefully balanced mixed time-scale
time-varying consensus and gradient contribution step sizes and a bounded
nonlinear operator on the consensus update to limit the effect of heavy-tailed
noise. Assuming heterogeneous strongly convex local costs with mutually
different minimizers that are arbitrarily far apart, we show that the proposed
method converges to a neighborhood of the network-wide problem solution in the
mean squared error (MSE) sense, and we also characterize the corresponding
convergence rate. We further show that the asymptotic MSE can be made
arbitrarily small through consensus step-size tuning, possibly at the cost of
slowing down the transient error decay. Numerical experiments corroborate our
findings and demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method to heavy-tailed
(and infinite variance) communication noise. They also show that existing
distributed methods, designed for finite-communication-noise-variance settings,
fail in the presence of infinite variance noise.

Motivation: 传统高斯方法难以捕捉空间数据中的极端依赖关系，因此需要一种能够同时建模典型空间模式和极端依赖的新方法。

Method: A2-SBNN将A2 Copula嵌入网络权重初始化，结合Wasserstein损失、矩匹配和相关惩罚进行训练。

Result: 模拟结果显示，A2-SBNN在不同依赖强度下均表现出高精度，优于传统高斯方法。

Conclusion: A2-SBNN为空间数据建模提供了一种高效的新方法，特别适用于捕捉极端依赖关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the A2 Copula Spatial Bayesian Neural Network
(A2-SBNN), a predictive spatial model designed to map coordinates to continuous
fields while capturing both typical spatial patterns and extreme dependencies.
By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the
network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial
relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained
through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment

uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high
accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective
solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based

### [425] [Data Fusion for Partial Identification of Causal Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24296)
*Quinn Lanners,Cynthia Rudin,Alexander Volfovsky,Harsh Parikh*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的部分识别框架，用于在关键假设同时失效时估计因果效应，并通过可解释的敏感性参数量化假设违反情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在关键假设同时失效时无法识别或估计因果效应，这在实践中很常见。

Method: 引入部分识别框架和可解释的敏感性参数，开发双重稳健估计器，并应用崩溃前沿分析。

Result: 应用于Project STAR研究，结果显示其结论对关键假设的违反具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了因果结论的可信度，即使在存在潜在未测量偏差的情况下。

Abstract: Data fusion techniques integrate information from heterogeneous data sources
to improve learning, generalization, and decision making across data sciences.
In causal inference, these methods leverage rich observational data to improve
causal effect estimation, while maintaining the trustworthiness of randomized
controlled trials. Existing approaches often relax the strong no unobserved
confounding assumption by instead assuming exchangeability of counterfactual
outcomes across data sources. However, when both assumptions simultaneously
fail - a common scenario in practice - current methods cannot identify or
estimate causal effects. We address this limitation by proposing a novel
partial identification framework that enables researchers to answer key
questions such as: Is the causal effect positive or negative? and How severe
must assumption violations be to overturn this conclusion? Our approach
introduces interpretable sensitivity parameters that quantify assumption
violations and derives corresponding causal effect bounds. We develop doubly
robust estimators for these bounds and operationalize breakdown frontier
analysis to understand how causal conclusions change as assumption violations
increase. We apply our framework to the Project STAR study, which investigates
the effect of classroom size on students' third-grade standardized test
performance. Our analysis reveals that the Project STAR results are robust to
simultaneous violations of key assumptions, both on average and across various
subgroups of interest. This strengthens confidence in the study's conclusions
despite potential unmeasured biases in the data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机使用量激增，需要加强安全措施以防止空域违规和安全威胁。

Method: 使用4,500秒的音频样本，采用参数高效微调（PEFT）和数据增强，比较CNN和Transformer的性能。

Result: CNN在准确率上比Transformer高1-2%，且计算效率更高，但Transformer有潜力。

Conclusion: 未来计划扩大数据集以进一步优化Transformer，探索两种方法的权衡。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usage is expected to surge in the coming
decade, raising the need for heightened security measures to prevent airspace
violations and security threats. This study investigates deep learning
approaches to UAV classification focusing on the key issue of data scarcity. To
investigate this we opted to train the models using a total of 4,500 seconds of
audio samples, evenly distributed across a 9-class dataset. We leveraged
parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and data augmentations to mitigate the
data scarcity. This paper implements and compares the use of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and attention-based transformers. Our results show that,
CNNs outperform transformers by 1-2\% accuracy, while still being more
computationally efficient. These early findings, however, point to potential in
using transformers models; suggesting that with more data and further
optimizations they could outperform CNNs. Future works aims to upscale the
dataset to better understand the trade-offs between these approaches.

Abstract: This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse
Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing
higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio
reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio
applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone
configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound
field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone
arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs
directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range
of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic
absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of
the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The
dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio,
particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room
acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high
level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source
localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种灵活的无监督解决方案，能够有效处理多样音频样本并识别模式，克服了以往的结构和输入限制。

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for detecting audio patterns
in musical samples (loops) through anomaly detection techniques, addressing
challenges in music information retrieval (MIR). Existing methods are often
constrained by reliance on handcrafted features, domain-specific limitations,
or dependence on iterative user interaction. We address these limitations
through an architecture combining deep feature extraction with unsupervised
anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a pre-trained Hierarchical
Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), paired with a Feature Fusion
Mechanism (FFM), to generate representations from variable-length audio loops.
These embeddings are processed using one-class Deep Support Vector Data
Description (Deep SVDD), which learns normative audio patterns by mapping them
to a compact latent hypersphere. Evaluations on curated bass and guitar
datasets compare standard and residual autoencoder variants against baselines
like Isolation Forest (IF) and and principle component analysis (PCA) methods.
Results show our Deep SVDD models, especially the residual autoencoder variant,
deliver improved anomaly separation, particularly for larger variations. This
research contributes a flexible, fully unsupervised solution for processing
diverse audio samples, overcoming previous structural and input limitations
while enabling effective pattern identification through distance-based latent
space scoring.

TL;DR: Discl-VC是一种新型零样本语音转换框架，通过解耦内容和韵律信息并结合上下文学习，实现了对目标说话者声音的高精度合成和韵律控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本语音转换系统难以准确复现源说话者的说话风格或模仿目标说话者的独特风格，限制了语音转换的可控性。

Method: 提出Discl-VC框架，从自监督语音表示中解耦内容和韵律信息，通过流匹配变换器和掩码生成变换器实现非自回归的韵律预测。

Result: 实验表明Discl-VC在零样本语音转换中表现优异，且在合成语音的韵律控制上具有显著准确性。

Conclusion: Discl-VC通过解耦和上下文学习，显著提升了语音转换的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Currently, zero-shot voice conversion systems are capable of synthesizing the
voice of unseen speakers. However, most existing approaches struggle to
accurately replicate the speaking style of the source speaker or mimic the
distinctive speaking style of the target speaker, thereby limiting the
controllability of voice conversion. In this work, we propose Discl-VC, a novel
voice conversion framework that disentangles content and prosody information
from self-supervised speech representations and synthesizes the target
speaker's voice through in-context learning with a flow matching transformer.
To enable precise control over the prosody of generated speech, we introduce a
mask generative transformer that predicts discrete prosody tokens in a
non-autoregressive manner based on prompts. Experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of Discl-VC in zero-shot voice conversion and its
remarkable accuracy in prosody control for synthesized speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺音分类对早期诊断呼吸系统疾病至关重要，但由于患者间存在变异性，需要一种考虑个体差异的学习方法。

Method: 提出了Patient-Aware Feature Alignment (PAFA)框架，包含两种损失函数：PCSL用于聚类同一患者的特征并分离其他患者的特征，GPAL用于将每个患者的特征中心拉向全局中心。

Result: 在ICBHI数据集上，四分类和二分类的准确率分别达到64.84%和72.08%。

Conclusion: PAFA能够捕捉个体化模式，并在不同患者集群中表现出性能提升，为以患者为中心的医疗提供了更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Lung sound classification is vital for early diagnosis of respiratory
diseases. However, biomedical signals often exhibit inter-patient variability
even among patients with the same symptoms, requiring a learning approach that
considers individual differences. We propose a Patient-Aware Feature Alignment
(PAFA) framework with two novel losses, Patient Cohesion-Separation Loss (PCSL)
and Global Patient Alignment Loss (GPAL). PCSL clusters features of the same
patient while separating those from other patients to capture patient
variability, whereas GPAL draws each patient's centroid toward a global center,
preventing feature space fragmentation. Our method achieves outstanding results
on the ICBHI dataset with a score of 64.84\% for four-class and 72.08\% for
two-class classification. These findings highlight PAFA's ability to capture
individualized patterns and demonstrate performance gains in distinct patient
clusters, offering broader applications for patient-centered healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频深度伪造检测框架在面对新攻击时性能下降，而传统的排练方法未能有效捕捉音频特征的多样性，导致偏差和遗忘风险。

Method: 提出RAIS方法，利用标签生成网络生成辅助标签，指导多样本选择以优化内存缓冲区。

Result: 实验表明RAIS在五个经验中平均EER为1.953%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAIS通过辅助标签指导的多样本选择，有效解决了传统排练方法的局限性，提升了音频深度伪造检测的性能。

Abstract: The performance of existing audio deepfake detection frameworks degrades when
confronted with new deepfake attacks. Rehearsal-based continual learning (CL),
which updates models using a limited set of old data samples, helps preserve
prior knowledge while incorporating new information. However, existing
rehearsal techniques don't effectively capture the diversity of audio
characteristics, introducing bias and increasing the risk of forgetting. To
address this challenge, we propose Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling
(RAIS), a rehearsal-based CL approach for audio deepfake detection. RAIS
employs a label generation network to produce auxiliary labels, guiding diverse
sample selection for the memory buffer. Extensive experiments show RAIS
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Equal Error Rate
(EER) of 1.953 % across five experiences. The code is available at:

Result: 在VTUAD水听器数据集上，模型测试准确率达96.63%，超越之前基准12个百分点。

Conclusion: CATFISH模型在多变水声环境中表现出色，通过动态频率强调和传感器数据融合提升了性能。

Abstract: Reliably monitoring and recognizing maritime vessels based on acoustic
signatures is complicated by the variability of different recording scenarios.
A robust classification framework must be able to generalize across diverse
acoustic environments and variable source-sensor distances. To this end, we
present a deep learning model with robust performance across different
recording scenarios. Using a trainable spectral front-end and temporal feature
encoder to learn a Gabor filterbank, the model can dynamically emphasize
different frequency components. Trained on the VTUAD hydrophone recordings from
the Strait of Georgia, our model, CATFISH, achieves a state-of-the-art 96.63 %
percent test accuracy across varying source-sensor distances, surpassing the
previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points. We present the model, justify
our architectural choices, analyze the learned Gabor filters, and perform
ablation studies on sensor data fusion and attention-based pooling.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了多语言语音处理的性能，尤其在资源受限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained
Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like
Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However,
these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper
enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple
strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial
fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation
to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our
approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative
reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型推理成本高，现有KG-RAG方法因检索大量知识上下文进一步增加成本，需一种高效的路由方法平衡性能与开销。

Method: 基于检索评分分布与查询难度的强相关性，提出无需训练的KG-RAG路由框架，动态分配查询到不同规模的LLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可减少50%对大模型的调用，且不牺牲响应质量。

Conclusion: 提出的路由框架为高效、可扩展的LLM部署提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but often incur high inference
costs during deployment. To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a
knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However,
the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs
further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing,
which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs.
However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing
training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need
for extensive training data. We observe that the score distributions produced
by the retrieval scorer strongly correlate with query difficulty. Based on
this, we propose a novel, training-free routing framework, the first tailored
to KG-RAG that effectively balances performance and cost in a plug-and-play
manner. Experiments show our method reduces calls to larger LLMs by up to 50%
without sacrificing response quality, demonstrating its potential for efficient
and scalable LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在同时实现高保真度、计算效率和多目标优化方面存在不足，且未能全面考虑mRNA生命周期和翻译过程的因素。

Method: RNop利用大规模数据集和四种损失函数（GPLoss、CAILoss、tAILoss和MFELoss），优化物种特异性密码子适应、tRNA可用性和mRNA二级结构特征。

Result: RNop在计算吞吐量（47.32序列/秒）和蛋白质表达提升方面显著优于现有方法，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: RNop为高效、有效的mRNA设计提供了新方法，超越了现有技术的定量指标和实验验证。

Abstract: The mRNA optimization is critical for therapeutic and biotechnological
applications, since sequence features directly govern protein expression levels
and efficacy. However, current methods face significant challenges in
simultaneously achieving three key objectives: (1) fidelity (preventing
unintended amino acid changes), (2) computational efficiency (speed and
scalability), and (3) the scope of optimization variables considered
(multi-objective capability). Furthermore, existing methods often fall short of
comprehensively incorporating the factors related to the mRNA lifecycle and
translation process, including intrinsic mRNA sequence properties, secondary
structure, translation elongation kinetics, and tRNA availability. To address
these limitations, we introduce \textbf{RNop}, a novel deep learning-based
method for mRNA optimization. We collect a large-scale dataset containing over
3 million sequences and design four specialized loss functions, the GPLoss,
CAILoss, tAILoss, and MFELoss, which simultaneously enable explicit control
over sequence fidelity while optimizing species-specific codon adaptation, tRNA
availability, and desirable mRNA secondary structure features. Then, we
demonstrate RNop's effectiveness through extensive in silico and in vivo
experiments. RNop ensures high sequence fidelity, achieves significant
computational throughput up to 47.32 sequences/s, and yields optimized mRNA
sequences resulting in a significant increase in protein expression for
functional proteins compared to controls. RNop surpasses current methodologies
in both quantitative metrics and experimental validation, enlightening a new
dawn for efficient and effective mRNA design. Code and models will be available

Result: 在鼠和猕猴的视网膜细胞中成功恢复已知进化关系并发现新对应关系，实验验证了其中一种。

Conclusion: OT-MESH为跨物种细胞类型映射提供了原则性、可扩展、对称且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is
a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.
Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which
imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or
projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and
obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present
OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized
optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type
homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn
(MESH) technique to refine the OT plan. It begins by selecting genes with high
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to capture the most informative features, from
which a cost matrix is constructed using cosine distances between cell-type
centroids. Importantly, the MESH procedure iteratively refines the cost matrix,
leading to a transport plan with significantly enhanced sparsity and
interpretability of the resulting correspondence matrices. Applied to retinal
bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque,
OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel
correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus,
our framework offers a principled, scalable, symmetric, and interpretable
solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into
cellular specialization and conservation across species.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清人类智能与AI的区别，强调人类在目标设定和情感基础方面的独特性。

Method: 分析157个YouTube视频的元数据，结合主题分析和关键词定量指标。

Result: 公众对AI既着迷又焦虑，讨论主题包括隐私、失业、伦理等。

Conclusion: 人类智能整合目标设定与追求，AI需作为工具增强而非替代人类，呼吁伦理对齐和以人为中心的AI发展。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel conceptual framework distinguishing
problem-seeking from problem-solving to clarify the unique features of human
intelligence in contrast to AI. Problem-seeking refers to the embodied,
emotionally grounded process by which humans identify and set goals, while
problem-solving denotes the execution of strategies aimed at achieving such
predefined objectives. The framework emphasizes that while AI excels at
efficiency and optimization, it lacks the orientation derived from experiential
grounding and the embodiment flexibility intrinsic to human cognition. To
empirically explore this distinction, the research analyzes metadata from 157
YouTube videos discussing AI. Conducting a thematic analysis combining
qualitative insights with keyword-based quantitative metrics, this
mixed-methods approach uncovers recurring themes in public discourse, including
privacy, job displacement, misinformation, optimism, and ethical concerns. The
results reveal a dual sentiment: public fascination with AI's capabilities
coexists with anxiety and skepticism about its societal implications. The
discussion critiques the orthogonality thesis, which posits that intelligence
is separable from goal content, and instead argues that human intelligence
integrates goal-setting and goal-pursuit. It underscores the centrality of
embodied cognition in human reasoning and highlights how AI's limitations come
from its current reliance on computational processing. The study advocates for
enhancing emotional and digital literacy to foster responsible AI engagement.
It calls for reframing public discourse to recognize AI as a tool that augments
-- rather than replaces -- human intelligence. By positioning problem seeking
at the core of cognition and as a critical dimension of intelligence, this
research offers new perspectives on ethically aligned and human-centered AI
development.

Conclusion: Gemini 2.5 Pro被定位为学习领域的领先AI模型。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform education, but the
research community lacks a robust, general benchmark to evaluate AI models for
learning. To assess state-of-the-art support for educational use cases, we ran
an "arena for learning" where educators and pedagogy experts conduct blind,
head-to-head, multi-turn comparisons of leading AI models. In particular, $N =
189$ educators drew from their experience to role-play realistic learning use
cases, interacting with two models sequentially, after which $N = 206$ experts
judged which model better supported the user's learning goals. The arena
evaluated a slate of state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and OpenAI o3. Excluding ties, experts preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro
in 73.2% of these match-ups -- ranking it first overall in the arena. Gemini
2.5 Pro also demonstrated markedly higher performance across key principles of

### [441] [Bounds on the Excess Minimum Risk via Generalized Information Divergence Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24117)
*Ananya Omanwar,Fady Alajaji,Tamás Linder*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了在马尔可夫链$Y \to X \to Z$下，利用广义信息散度度量推导了超额最小风险的上界，推广了基于互信息的界限，适用于更广泛的联合分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过广义信息散度度量（如Rényi散度和α-Jensen-Shannon散度）来更灵活地估计目标向量$Y$，并放宽对子高斯参数的限制。

Method: 使用Rényi散度、α-Jensen-Shannon散度和Sibson互信息等广义信息散度度量，推导超额最小风险的上界。

Result: 提出的广义散度界限在特定参数范围内比基于互信息的界限更紧，且适用于非恒定子高斯参数的情况。

Conclusion: 广义信息散度度量提供了更灵活和紧致的超额最小风险界限，适用于更广泛的分布假设。

Abstract: Given finite-dimensional random vectors $Y$, $X$, and $Z$ that form a Markov
chain in that order (i.e., $Y \to X \to Z$), we derive upper bounds on the
excess minimum risk using generalized information divergence measures. Here,
$Y$ is a target vector to be estimated from an observed feature vector $X$ or
its stochastically degraded version $Z$. The excess minimum risk is defined as
the difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating $Y$ from $X$ and
from $Z$. We present a family of bounds that generalize the mutual information
based bound of Gy\"orfi et al. (2023), using the R\'enyi and
$\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon divergences, as well as Sibson's mutual information.
Our bounds are similar to those developed by Modak et al. (2021) and Aminian et
al. (2024) for the generalization error of learning algorithms. However, unlike
these works, our bounds do not require the sub-Gaussian parameter to be
constant and therefore apply to a broader class of joint distributions over
$Y$, $X$, and $Z$. We also provide numerical examples under both constant and
non-constant sub-Gaussianity assumptions, illustrating that our generalized
divergence based bounds can be tighter than the one based on mutual information
for certain regimes of the parameter $\alpha$.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种代理目标框架，解决了脉冲神经网络（SNN）在连续控制任务中与强化学习（RL）算法不兼容的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL算法针对人工神经网络（ANN）设计，与SNN的离散、不可微特性冲突，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 提出代理目标框架，利用连续可微的动态特性绕过SNN的兼容性问题，稳定RL算法。

Result: 实验表明，代理目标框架使SNN性能提升32%，首次在连续控制任务中超越ANN。

Conclusion: 该研究为SNN友好的RL算法开辟了新方向，推动了高性能低功耗的神经形态代理发展。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient
decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent
studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by
SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is
suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are
designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism,
which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We
identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control
tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we
propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable
dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the
incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy
network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency
during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on
continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the
proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance
across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN
performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored
to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine
high performance with low power consumption.

Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable
optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The
programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes
relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a
set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not
available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the
interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied.
A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to
determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture,
obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the
effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical
solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit
architectures.

Motivation: 畴壁动力学受局部微观结构影响，传统方法效率低，需高分辨率研究。

Method: 使用ML控制的自动化压电力显微镜技术，分析1500个开关事件。

Result: 畴壁位移不仅依赖电场参数，还与局部铁电-铁弹构型相关，不同构型对偏压响应不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果可用于设计铁电存储器，通过畴构型与脉冲参数的预测映射实现高效设计。

Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly
position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local
microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the
wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers
and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding
the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human
experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$
were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the
polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall
displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local
ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in
polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up
to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias
increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$
$\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics
on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with
the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive
map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This
microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing
ferroelectric memories.

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization
typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and
resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely
performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine
learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data
to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of
materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from
characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In
this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative
metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM),
using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy.
Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features
of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images
of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a
foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of
materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated wakes
around a wing. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network
referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative
component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at
a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal
structure. We consider three examples of separated flows around a NACA0012
airfoil, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, 2.
strong vortex-airfoil interactions, and 3. a turbulent wake in a
spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical
structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic
shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the
fluctuation level from their mean values. With the second example of
vortex-airfoil interactions, how the effect of vortex gust on a wing emerges in
the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner.
Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights
structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based
solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics
and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of
unsteady aerodynamic problems.

Method: 通过复杂度指标分析LLM生成代码的性能，并基于此提出迭代反馈方法，利用复杂度信息优化生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了代码生成的成功率，尤其在较小模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo）上效果更明显。

Conclusion: 复杂度感知反馈能有效提升LLM生成代码的正确性，适用于直接提示和基于代理的工作流程。

Abstract: Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on
improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work
tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to
improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic
of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the
success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity
metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation
with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic
regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of
code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback
method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity
metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple
benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs
(i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the
results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative
execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment
results show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a
smaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to
the baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands
experiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code
generation agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07%
(GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances
both direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.

Abstract: While multi-agent LLM systems show strong capabilities in various domains,
they are highly vulnerable to adversarial and low-performing agents. To resolve
this issue, in this paper, we introduce a general and adversary-resistant
multi-agent LLM framework based on credibility scoring. We model the
collaborative query-answering process as an iterative game, where the agents
communicate and contribute to a final system output. Our system associates a
credibility score that is used when aggregating the team outputs. The
credibility scores are learned gradually based on the past contributions of
each agent in query answering. Our experiments across multiple tasks and
settings demonstrate our system's effectiveness in mitigating adversarial
influence and enhancing the resilience of multi-agent cooperation, even in the
adversary-majority settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中的临床数据搜索通常是一个手动且易出错的过程，需要工具能够处理关键词同义词、语义变体和开放式查询。

Method: SearchAI采用分层模型，预测性地导航编码层次结构，确保所有路径可达且不丢失相关节点。

Result: 实验表明，SearchAI在准确性、鲁棒性、性能和可扩展性方面优于传统分层遍历方法。

Conclusion: SearchAI能够提升临床数据的可访问性，优化工作流程，减少管理负担，并提高编码和诊断准确性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a major impact on healthcare,
particularly through its application in natural language processing (NLP) and
predictive analytics. The healthcare sector has increasingly adopted AI for
tasks such as clinical data analysis and medical code assignment. However,
searching for clinical information in large and often unorganized datasets
remains a manual and error-prone process. Assisting this process with
automations can help physicians improve their operational productivity
significantly.
  In this paper, we present a generative AI approach, coined SearchAI, to
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of searching clinical data. Unlike
traditional code assignment, which is a one-to-one problem, clinical data
search is a one-to-many problem, i.e., a given search query can map to a family
of codes. Healthcare professionals typically search for groups of related
diseases, drugs, or conditions that map to many codes, and therefore, they need
search tools that can handle keyword synonyms, semantic variants, and broad
open-ended queries. SearchAI employs a hierarchical model that respects the
coding hierarchy and improves the traversal of relationships from parent to
child nodes. SearchAI navigates these hierarchies predictively and ensures that
all paths are reachable without losing any relevant nodes.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of SearchAI, we conducted a series of
experiments using both public and production datasets. Our results show that
SearchAI outperforms default hierarchical traversals across several metrics,
including accuracy, robustness, performance, and scalability. SearchAI can help
make clinical data more accessible, leading to streamlined workflows, reduced
administrative burden, and enhanced coding and diagnostic accuracy.

Result: 论文提出了针对LLMs在模式匹配中的三大核心问题的解决方案，提升了自动化的可行性和效率。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在模式匹配中面临挑战，但通过技术优化，可以显著提升其在实际应用中的效果和效率。

Abstract: The growing need to integrate information from a large number of diverse
sources poses significant scalability challenges for data integration systems.
These systems often rely on manually written schema mappings, which are
complex, source-specific, and costly to maintain as sources evolve. While
recent advances suggest that large language models (LLMs) can assist in
automating schema matching by leveraging both structural and natural language
cues, key challenges remain. In this paper, we identify three core issues with
using LLMs for schema mapping: (1) inconsistent outputs due to sensitivity to
input phrasing and structure, which we propose methods to address through
sampling and aggregation techniques; (2) the need for more expressive mappings
(e.g., GLaV), which strain the limited context windows of LLMs; and (3) the
computational cost of repeated LLM calls, which we propose to mitigate through
strategies like data type prefiltering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a
spectrum of tasks in financial services, including report generation, chatbots,
sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, investment advisory, financial
knowledge retrieval, and summarization. However, their intrinsic complexity and
lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly
regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and
accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the
first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the
inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the
pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic
interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM
behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the
activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how
specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not
only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore
the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its
practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments,
including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and
hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic
interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs
increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain
ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations. In this
paper, we have put special emphasis on how these techniques can help unlock
interpretability requirements for regulatory and compliance purposes -
addressing both current needs and anticipating future expectations from
financial regulators globally.

Motivation: 高亮度光源升级带来实验复杂度和数据量的激增，传统方法难以处理，需要新的实时控制和知识提取技术。

Conclusion: 机器学习驱动的实时优化和知识提取是实现高亮度光源设计性能的关键。

Abstract: With the increasing brightness of Light sources, including the
Diffraction-Limited brightness upgrade of APS and the high-repetition-rate
upgrade of LCLS, the proposed experiments therein are becoming increasingly
complex. For instance, experiments at LCLS-II-HE will require the X-ray beam to
be within a fraction of a micron in diameter, with pointing stability of a few
nanoradians, at the end of a kilometer-long electron accelerator, a
hundred-meter-long undulator section, and tens of meters long X-ray optics.
This enhancement of brightness will increase the data production rate to rival
the largest data generators in the world. Without real-time active feedback
control and an optimized pipeline to transform measurements to scientific
information and insights, researchers will drown in a deluge of mostly useless
data, and fail to extract the highly sophisticated insights that the recent
brightness upgrades promise.
  In this article, we outline the strategy we are developing at SLAC to
implement Machine Learning driven optimization, automation and real-time
knowledge extraction from the electron-injector at the start of the electron
accelerator, to the multidimensional X-ray optical systems, and till the
experimental endstations and the high readout rate, multi-megapixel detectors
at LCLS to deliver the design performance to the users. This is illustrated via
examples from Accelerator, Optics and End User applications.

### [455] [Sparsity-Driven Parallel Imaging Consistency for Improved Self-Supervised MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24136)
*Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过扰动训练物理驱动的深度学习模型的新方法，以解决高加速率下自监督学习引入伪影的问题，并在实验中取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高加速率MRI扫描中，自监督学习常引入伪影，影响图像质量，因此需要一种更可靠的训练方法。

Method: 通过精心设计的扰动训练PD-DL网络，并在稀疏域中评估模型对扰动的预测能力，引入一致性项以提升重建质量。

Result: 在fastMRI膝部和脑部数据集上，该方法显著减少了伪影和噪声放大，视觉和定量评估均优于现有自监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的训练策略在高加速率MRI重建中表现出色，为无参考数据场景提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models have proven to be a powerful
approach for improved reconstruction of rapid MRI scans. In order to train
these models in scenarios where fully-sampled reference data is unavailable,
self-supervised learning has gained prominence. However, its application at
high acceleration rates frequently introduces artifacts, compromising image
fidelity. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel way to train PD-DL
networks via carefully-designed perturbations. In particular, we enhance the
k-space masking idea of conventional self-supervised learning with a novel
consistency term that assesses the model's ability to accurately predict the
added perturbations in a sparse domain, leading to more reliable and
artifact-free reconstructions. The results obtained from the fastMRI knee and
brain datasets show that the proposed training strategy effectively reduces
aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification at high acceleration
rates, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods both visually and
quantitatively.

*Korel Gundem,Juncheng Dong,Dennis Zhang,Vahid Tarokh,Zhengling Qi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为监督校准（SC）的框架，通过优化损失函数学习每类的仿射变换，以解决大语言模型（LLM）在上下文学习中存在的系统偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在上下文学习中存在系统偏差，导致分类性能不稳定，现有校准方法仅能调整决策边界位置而无法改变其方向。

Method: 提出SC框架，在logit空间中对LLM的预测概率进行每类仿射变换，无需额外数据，并引入两种正则化技术（上下文不变性和方向信任区域）。

Result: SC在4-shot、8-shot和16-shot设置下，在多个数据集和模型上优于现有校准基线方法。

Conclusion: SC不仅统一了现有校准方法，还能调整决策边界方向，显著提升了LLM在上下文学习中的性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new
tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from
systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While
calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in
the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the
LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation.
This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To
address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose
Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns
an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive
probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the
context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many
existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the
ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's
decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless
integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance
and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability
issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC
delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot,
8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: 结论是DTC框架为高效深度学习训练提供了有前景的途径，并通过吉布斯熵形式化了随机性与压缩的关系。

Abstract: A proposition that connects randomness and compression put forward via Gibbs
entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process.
The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it
directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition
originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic
Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic
reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed
projections, so called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied
to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level
pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appear in iterative fashion and
act as smart neural architecture search, Experiments demonstrated utility of
this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient
compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket
hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar
performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from
statistical physics perspective, we formulated so called {\it Gibbs
randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression
relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, DTC framework provides a promising
approach for massively energy and resource efficient deep learning training
approach.

Conclusion: SeqCRC为关键应用中的目标检测提供了可靠的统计保证，并展示了实际应用中的权衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in object detectors have led to their adoption for industrial
uses. However, their deployment in critical applications is hindered by the
inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of
object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal
Prediction, a post-hoc procedure which offers statistical guarantees that are
valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or
data distribution. Our contribution is manifold: first, we formally define the
problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD) and introduce a novel method,
Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical
guarantees of Conformal Risk Control (CRC) to two sequential tasks with two
parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we propose loss functions and
prediction sets suited to applying CRC to different applications and
certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit, enabling
replication and further exploration of our methods. Using this toolkit, we
perform extensive experiments, yielding a benchmark that validates the
investigated methods and emphasizes trade-offs and other practical
consequences.

Conclusion: 这是首个研究在performative环境下实现统计严格风险控制的工作，为决策过程中的策略操纵提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Calibrating blackbox machine learning models to achieve risk control is
crucial to ensure reliable decision-making. A rich line of literature has been
studying how to calibrate a model so that its predictions satisfy explicit
finite-sample statistical guarantees under a fixed, static, and unknown
data-generating distribution. However, prediction-supported decisions may
influence the outcome they aim to predict, a phenomenon named performativity of
predictions, which is commonly seen in social science and economics. In this
paper, we introduce Performative Risk Control, a framework to calibrate models
to achieve risk control under performativity with provable theoretical
guarantees. Specifically, we provide an iteratively refined calibration
process, where we ensure the predictions are improved and risk-controlled
throughout the process. We also study different types of risk measures and
choices of tail bounds. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework by numerical experiments on the task of predicting credit default
risk. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to study
statistically rigorous risk control under performativity, which will serve as
an important safeguard against a wide range of strategic manipulation in
decision-making processes.

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态对比学习提供了更灵活的工具，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning is a methodology for linking different data
modalities; the canonical example is linking image and text data. The
methodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one
for each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In
this work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning
as the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional
probability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,
consistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal
algorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of
these conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is
similar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.
  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This
probabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive
learning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use
of alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We
study these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate
Gaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a
low-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the
capabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural
statistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel
variants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for
generative tasks. The framework we introduce is also studied through numerical
experiments on multivariate Gaussians, the labeled MNIST dataset, and on a data
assimilation application arising in oceanography.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has become an essential machine learning tool for
addressing multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been effectively
applied across fields such as healthcare, marketing, and biomedical research.
However, to enable efficient information sharing across tasks, it is crucial to
leverage both shared and heterogeneous information. Despite extensive research
on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity, including distribution and posterior
heterogeneity, present significant challenges. Existing methods often fail to
address these forms of heterogeneity within a unified framework. In this paper,
we propose a dual-encoder framework to construct a heterogeneous latent factor
space for each task, incorporating a task-shared encoder to capture common
information across tasks and a task-specific encoder to preserve unique task
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the intrinsic similarity structure of
the coefficients corresponding to learned latent factors, allowing for adaptive
integration across tasks to manage posterior heterogeneity. We introduce a
unified algorithm that alternately learns the task-specific and task-shared
encoders and coefficients. In theory, we investigate the excess risk bound for
the proposed MTL method using local Rademacher complexity and apply it to a new
but related task. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing data integration methods across various settings.
Furthermore, the proposed method achieves superior predictive performance for
time to tumor doubling across five distinct cancer types in PDX data.

Conclusion: 理论框架统一了自注意力的两种失败模式，并给出了保证训练平滑的定量预测。

Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure
smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation
can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse,
where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse,
where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While
the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks,
an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has
so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal
propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers,
layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention
layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from
statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the
variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we
recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored
high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse}
occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the
residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields
trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation
hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models
trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework
gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and
gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual
connections that guarantees smooth training.

Conclusion: 该方法在环境科学逆问题中实现了最先进的预测效果。

Abstract: Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible framework
to predict spatially distributed variables with uncertainty. But the use of
nonstationary priors, often necessary for capturing complex spatial patterns,
makes sampling from the predictive posterior distribution (PPD) computationally
intractable. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach based on diffusion
generative models (DGMs) to mimic PPDs associated with non-stationary GP
priors: we replace the GP prior by a DGM surrogate, and leverage recent
advances on training-free guidance algorithms for DGMs to sample from the
desired posterior distribution. We apply our approach to a rich non-stationary
GP prior from which exact posterior sampling is untractable and validate that
the issuing distributions are close to their GP counterpart using several
statistical metrics. We also demonstrate how one can fine-tune the trained DGMs
to target specific parts of the GP prior. Finally we apply the proposed
approach to solve inverse problems arising in environmental sciences, thus
yielding state-of-the-art predictions.

Conclusion: 本文为理解去噪自编码器的行为提供了理论支持，揭示了瓶颈层和跳跃连接在过参数化情况下的作用。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit strong generalization even in highly
overparameterized regimes. Significant progress has been made to understand
this phenomenon in the context of supervised learning, but for unsupervised
tasks such as denoising, several open questions remain. While some recent works
have successfully characterized the test error of the linear denoising problem,
they are limited to linear models (one-layer network). In this work, we focus
on two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow,
incorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A
low-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on
the learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that
bypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical
points of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe
its global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive
the test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and
without skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena:
Firstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin
to the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width
reduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection
can mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the
model is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip
connections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our
claims with numerical evidence.

Result: K²IE在预测性能上与现有方法相当，但在计算效率上显著优于基于核方法的最新估计器。

Conclusion: K²IE不仅提供了理论上的新见解，还在实际应用中表现出更高的效率。

Abstract: Kernel method-based intensity estimators, formulated within reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), and classical kernel intensity estimators (KIEs)
have been among the most easy-to-implement and feasible methods for estimating
the intensity functions of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. While both
approaches share the term "kernel", they are founded on distinct theoretical
principles, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we
propose a novel regularized kernel method for Poisson processes based on the
least squares loss and show that the resulting intensity estimator involves a
specialized variant of the representer theorem: it has the dual coefficient of
unity and coincides with classical KIEs. This result provides new theoretical
insights into the connection between classical KIEs and kernel method-based
intensity estimators, while enabling us to develop an efficient KIE by
leveraging advanced techniques from RKHS theory. We refer to the proposed model
as the kernel method-based kernel intensity estimator (K$^2$IE). Through
experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that K$^2$IE achieves comparable
predictive performance while significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art
kernel method-based estimator in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 传统方法（如LASSO）在支持选择和信号估计时缺乏显式错误控制，而TheName通过统计Knockoff滤波器分离并控制支持恢复过程，确保有限样本下的FDR控制，从而更可靠地识别真实信号支持。

Method: 采用Knockoff滤波器分离支持恢复过程，并控制FDR，理论证明在较弱条件下优于传统基于ℓ1的压缩感知方法。

Result: 数值实验显示，TheName在F1分数上比基线方法提升高达3.9倍，重建误差更低，并在真实数据集上取得优异的下游预测性能。

Conclusion: TheName作为一种稳健且实用的方法，通过统计基础的支持选择，提供了理论保证和强实证表现，优于现有技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework,
referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise
false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase.
Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation
without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite
samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By
separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical
Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction,
especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We
establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures
recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based
compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based
method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art
compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves
F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false
discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also
consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further
validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream
predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often
narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed
signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical
alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target
distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces
training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that
reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key
to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models,
but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we
analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple
model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors,
sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and
target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition
occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is
smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of
relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we
demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent
overfitting. For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear
diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler
divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data
distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation
in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight
into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a
shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator
(RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient
by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function;
namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since
LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we
propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood
loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for
each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an
$O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which
results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic
high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as
well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face
recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the
proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other
methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.

Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g.,
perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models
and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used
in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical
networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics
analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with
generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is
large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more
realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but
also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on
the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a
dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate
around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are
comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich
phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data
increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons
of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to
learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear
combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its
weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes
available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms,
possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.

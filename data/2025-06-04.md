### [2] [No Free Lunch in Active Learning: LLM Embedding Quality Dictates Query Strategy Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01992)
*Lukas Rauch,Moritz Wirth,Denis Huseljic,Marek Herde,Bernhard Sick,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）嵌入提升深度主动学习（AL）的实用性，发现嵌入质量和查询策略选择对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过冻结LLM嵌入减少计算成本，重新评估深度AL的可行性。

Method: 使用MTEB排行榜上的五种高性能模型和两种基线模型，在十种文本分类任务中系统研究嵌入质量对AL策略的影响。

Result: 多样性采样与高质量嵌入协同提升早期AL性能；嵌入质量影响最优策略选择，Badge策略更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AL策略的效果高度依赖嵌入质量和目标任务，需进行上下文特定评估。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing
general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active
learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the
computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study
establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM
embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing
models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two
baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key
insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling
synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL
iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to
embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can
achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like
Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness
is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results
emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as
performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.

### [3] [NovelHopQA: Diagnosing Multi-Hop Reasoning Failures in Long Narrative Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02000)
*Abhay Gupta,Michael Lu,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NovelHopQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估在64k-128k令牌的长上下文和多跳推理（1-4跳）下的问答能力，揭示了当前前沿模型在长上下文和多跳推理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在涉及长上下文和多跳推理的问题上表现不佳，缺乏一个联合评估这两者的基准测试。

Method: 通过从83部公版小说中提取64k-128k令牌的片段，构建基于关键词引导的多跳问答链，并使用Oracle上下文过滤确保问题可回答。

Result: 前沿模型在多跳和长上下文下的准确率显著下降，表明规模并不能保证鲁棒的推理能力。

Conclusion: NovelHopQA为大规模多跳推理提供了一个诊断性测试环境，揭示了模型的常见失败模式。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to answer questions that span
tens of thousands of tokens, especially when multi-hop reasoning is involved.
While prior benchmarks explore long-context comprehension or multi-hop
reasoning in isolation, none jointly vary context length and reasoning depth in
natural narrative settings. We introduce NovelHopQA, the first benchmark to
evaluate k1-4 hop QA over 64k-128k-token excerpts from 83 full-length
public-domain novels. A keyword-guided pipeline builds hop-separated chains
grounded in coherent storylines. We evaluate six state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
and apply oracle-context filtering to ensure all questions are genuinely
answerable. Human annotators validate both alignment and hop depth. We noticed
consistent accuracy drops with increased hops and context length, even in
frontier models-revealing that sheer scale does not guarantee robust reasoning.
Our failure mode analysis highlights common breakdowns, such as missed
final-hop integration and long-range drift. NovelHopQA offers a controlled
diagnostic setting to stress-test multi-hop reasoning at scale.

### [4] [Pruning for Performance: Efficient Idiom and Metaphor Classification in Low-Resource Konkani Using mBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02005)
*Timothy Do,Pranav Saran,Harshita Poojary,Pranav Prabhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合mBERT、双向LSTM和线性分类器的混合模型，用于解决低资源语言（如Konkani）中比喻语言处理的挑战，并通过注意力头剪枝策略提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理系统在低资源语言中处理比喻语言表达的挑战。

Method: 采用混合模型（mBERT + 双向LSTM + 线性分类器），并引入梯度注意力头剪枝策略。

Result: 比喻分类任务准确率达78%，习语分类任务准确率达83%。

Conclusion: 注意力头剪枝策略对低资源语言的高效NLP工具构建有效。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the persistent challenges that figurative language
expressions pose for natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly in
low-resource languages such as Konkani. We present a hybrid model that
integrates a pre-trained Multilingual BERT (mBERT) with a bidirectional LSTM
and a linear classifier. This architecture is fine-tuned on a newly introduced
annotated dataset for metaphor classification, developed as part of this work.
To improve the model's efficiency, we implement a gradient-based attention head
pruning strategy. For metaphor classification, the pruned model achieves an
accuracy of 78%. We also applied our pruning approach to expand on an existing
idiom classification task, achieving 83% accuracy. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of attention head pruning for building efficient NLP tools in
underrepresented languages.

### [5] [Enhancing Paraphrase Type Generation: The Impact of DPO and RLHF Evaluated with Human-Ranked Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02018)
*Christopher Lee Lübbers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合人类排名数据和直接偏好优化（DPO），提高了生成语义准确的改写类型的能力，并显著提升了人类偏好评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改写类型生成方法依赖自动化指标和有限的人工标注数据，导致与人类偏好不一致，影响语义保真度和语言转换效果。

Method: 利用人类排名的改写类型数据集，并采用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，直接对齐模型输出与人类判断。

Result: DPO训练使改写类型生成准确率提高3个百分点，人类偏好评分提高7个百分点。检测模型在特定改写类型上F1分数表现优异。

Conclusion: 偏好数据和DPO训练能生成更可靠、语义准确的改写，为下游应用（如摘要和问答）提供支持，并推动基于人类标准的改写研究。

Abstract: Paraphrasing re-expresses meaning to enhance applications like text
simplification, machine translation, and question-answering. Specific
paraphrase types facilitate accurate semantic analysis and robust language
models. However, existing paraphrase-type generation methods often misalign
with human preferences due to reliance on automated metrics and limited
human-annotated training data, obscuring crucial aspects of semantic fidelity
and linguistic transformations.
  This study addresses this gap by leveraging a human-ranked paraphrase-type
dataset and integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model
outputs directly with human judgments. DPO-based training increases
paraphrase-type generation accuracy by 3 percentage points over a supervised
baseline and raises human preference ratings by 7 percentage points. A newly
created human-annotated dataset supports more rigorous future evaluations.
Additionally, a paraphrase-type detection model achieves F1 scores of 0.91 for
addition/deletion, 0.78 for same polarity substitution, and 0.70 for
punctuation changes.
  These findings demonstrate that preference data and DPO training produce more
reliable, semantically accurate paraphrases, enabling downstream applications
such as improved summarization and more robust question-answering. The PTD
model surpasses automated metrics and provides a more reliable framework for
evaluating paraphrase quality, advancing paraphrase-type research toward
richer, user-aligned language generation and establishing a stronger foundation
for future evaluations grounded in human-centric criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD在科学和工程中至关重要，但操作复杂且需要专业知识，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 通过结合CFD和OpenFOAM知识，构建结构化数据库，验证配置并实现错误反馈，利用自然语言提示或文献自动生成模拟。

Result: 验证表明，ChatCFD能自主复现已发表的CFD结果，处理复杂且未见过的配置，超越通用语言模型的能力。

Conclusion: ChatCFD通过自动化显著降低了CFD的使用门槛，提升了准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for scientific and
engineering advancements but is limited by operational complexity and the need
for extensive expertise. This paper presents ChatCFD, a large language
model-driven pipeline that automates CFD workflows within the OpenFOAM
framework. It enables users to configure and execute complex simulations from
natural language prompts or published literature with minimal expertise. The
innovation is its structured approach to database construction, configuration
validation, and error reflection, integrating CFD and OpenFOAM knowledge with
general language models to improve accuracy and adaptability. Validation shows
ChatCFD can autonomously reproduce published CFD results, handling complex,
unseen configurations beyond basic examples, a task challenging for general
language models.

### [7] [FinS-Pilot: A Benchmark for Online Financial System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02037)
*Feng Wang,Yiding Sun,Jiaxin Mao,Wei Xue,Danqing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinS-Pilot是一个针对在线金融应用的RAG系统评估基准，结合实时API数据和结构化文本，填补了金融领域专用评估工具的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融RAG基准因数据保密性和动态数据集成不足而受限的问题。

Method: 基于真实金融助手交互构建，整合实时API和结构化文本，通过意图分类框架组织。

Result: FinS-Pilot能全面评估金融助手处理静态知识和时效市场信息的能力，并识别适合金融应用的LLMs。

Conclusion: FinS-Pilot为金融NLP系统研究提供了实用的评估框架和精选数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated
through standardized benchmarks. However, the development of financial RAG
benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of
dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduces FinS-Pilot, a
novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications.
Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark
incorporates both real-time API data and structured text sources, organized
through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains
such as equity analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. The benchmark enables
comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both
static knowledge and time-sensitive market information. Through systematic
experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's
effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while
addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial
domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a
curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and
dataset are accessible on
GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/PhealenWang/financial\_rag\_benchmark}.

### [8] [Enhancing Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with BranchLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02041)
*Duzhen Zhang,Yong Ren,Zhong-Zhi Li,Yahan Yu,Jiahua Dong,Chenxing Li,Zhilong Ji,Jinfeng Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BranchLoRA提出了一种新的框架，通过不对称设计和任务专用分支解决多模态持续指令调优中的参数效率低下和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoELoRA）在多模态持续指令调优中存在参数效率低下和灾难性遗忘问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出BranchLoRA框架，采用不对称设计、灵活的调优-冻结机制和任务专用路由器，优化分支协作和任务分配。

Result: 实验表明，BranchLoRA在性能上显著优于MoELoRA，并在不同规模的MLLM中保持优势。

Conclusion: BranchLoRA有效提升了多模态持续指令调优的效率和性能，解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However,
these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all
LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In
this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA
framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose
BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance.
To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within
BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while
fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate
task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time,
rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we
introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the
appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on
the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms
MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.

### [9] [Evaluating the Unseen Capabilities: How Many Theorems Do LLMs Know?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02058)
*Xiang Li,Jiayi Xin,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了KnowSum框架，用于量化大语言模型（LLM）中未观察到的知识，以更全面地评估其能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法未能充分反映LLM的实际能力，尤其是未观察到的知识部分，导致评估危机。

Method: 引入KnowSum统计框架，通过外推观察到的知识实例频率来估计未观察到的知识。

Result: 实验表明，KnowSum在估计总知识、评估信息检索效果和测量输出多样性方面有效，揭示了传统评估方法遗漏了大量知识。

Conclusion: KnowSum显著改变了常见LLM的比较排名，强调了全面评估的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However,
current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these
models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to
this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge --
information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed
during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to
provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for
a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by
extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical
applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval
effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a
substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM
performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative
rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.

### [10] [Knowledge or Reasoning? A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126)
*Juncheng Wu,Sheng Liu,Haoqin Tu,Hang Yu,Xiaoke Huang,James Zou,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理增强型大语言模型在医学和数学领域的逐步推理过程，提出了一个细粒度评估框架，发现监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）对模型性能的不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理增强型大语言模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但其内部推理过程的质量和透明度尚未充分研究。本文旨在超越最终答案的准确性，深入分析逐步推理过程。

Method: 通过将推理轨迹分解为知识和推理两部分，引入细粒度评估框架，分别评估知识正确性（KI）和推理质量（InfoGain）。研究了基于SFT和RL训练的R1-distilled和基础Qwen模型。

Result: 发现：1）R1-distilled模型的通用推理能力在医学领域通过SFT或RL转移效果不佳；2）SFT提高最终答案准确性但降低推理质量；3）RL通过修剪不准确知识提升医学推理。

Conclusion: SFT在医学领域不可或缺，但需权衡推理质量；RL能有效优化推理路径，提升准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as
OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex
tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning
processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer
accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and
mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into
two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained
evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used
(measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured
by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled
and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or
reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing
findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do
not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2)
SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of
reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained
models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain
knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning
inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both
reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.

### [11] [Model Internal Sleuthing: Finding Lexical Identity and Inflectional Morphology in Modern Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02132)
*Michael Li,Nishant Subramani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现代大型语言模型（如BERT、GPT-2、Pythia等）如何编码词汇和形态信息，发现词汇信息在早期层线性集中，后期层非线性集中，而形态信息在各层均线性可分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代大型语言模型如何编码语言信息，尤其是词汇和形态特征。

Method: 训练线性和非线性分类器，分析模型各层激活以预测词汇和形态特征。

Result: 词汇信息在早期层线性集中，后期层非线性集中；形态信息在各层均线性可分，且通过抽象化编码。

Conclusion: 尽管模型架构和规模不同，但语言信息的组织方式相似，表明这些特性可能是预训练中学习的基本属性。

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our
understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of
early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models,
we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and
contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train
linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word
lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical
information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later
layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and
linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these
models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but
rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably,
these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in
architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and
instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite
substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize
linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could
be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during
pretraining. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ml5885/model_internal_sleuthing.

### [12] [BabyLM's First Constructions: Causal interventions provide a signal of learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02147)
*Joshua Rozner,Leonie Weissweiler,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使训练数据量符合儿童语言发展水平，语言模型仍能学习多样的构式，且构式表现与模型性能相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型（PLMs）在符合儿童语言发展水平的数据量下是否能学习构式，并验证构式学习与模型性能的关系。

Method: 使用Rozner等人的方法评估2024年BabyLM挑战赛中模型的构式学习能力。

Result: 模型在符合儿童发展水平的数据量下仍能学习多样构式，且构式表现与BabyLM基准测试性能相关。

Conclusion: 构式学习在语言模型中具有功能相关性，即使数据量有限，模型仍能有效学习构式。

Abstract: Construction grammar posits that children acquire constructions (form-meaning
pairings) from the statistics of their environment. Recent work supports this
hypothesis by showing sensitivity to constructions in pretrained language
models (PLMs), including one recent study (Rozner et al., 2025) demonstrating
that constructions shape the PLM's output distribution. However, models under
study have generally been trained on developmentally implausible amounts of
data, casting doubt on their relevance to human language learning. Here we use
Rozner et al.'s methods to evaluate constructional learning in models from the
2024 BabyLM challenge. Our results show that even when trained on
developmentally plausible quantities of data, models represent diverse
constructions, even hard cases that are superficially indistinguishable. We
further find correlational evidence that constructional performance may be
functionally relevant: models that better represent constructions perform
better on the BabyLM benchmarks.

*Amir Hussein,Cihan Xiao,Matthew Wiesner,Dan Povey,Leibny Paola Garcia,Sanjeev Khudanpur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HENT-SRT提出了一种分层高效的神经转录器框架，用于语音识别和翻译，通过任务分解和自蒸馏技术提升性能，同时优化计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经转录器在语音翻译中面临词序重排和性能下降问题，且训练成本高，需改进。

Method: 采用分层编码器、无状态预测器和剪枝转录器损失优化计算效率，并通过自蒸馏和CTC一致性正则化提升性能。

Result: 在阿拉伯语、西班牙语和普通话数据集上取得新SOTA性能，显著缩小与AED模型的差距。

Conclusion: HENT-SRT有效解决了神经转录器在语音翻译中的挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Neural transducers (NT) provide an effective framework for speech streaming,
demonstrating strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR).
However, the application of NT to speech translation (ST) remains challenging,
as existing approaches struggle with word reordering and performance
degradation when jointly modeling ASR and ST, resulting in a gap with
attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Existing NT-based ST approaches
also suffer from high computational training costs. To address these issues, we
propose HENT-SRT (Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer for Speech
Recognition and Translation), a novel framework that factorizes ASR and
translation tasks to better handle reordering. To ensure robust ST while
preserving ASR performance, we use self-distillation with CTC consistency
regularization. Moreover, we improve computational efficiency by incorporating
best practices from ASR transducers, including a down-sampled hierarchical
encoder, a stateless predictor, and a pruned transducer loss to reduce training
complexity. Finally, we introduce a blank penalty during decoding, reducing
deletions and improving translation quality. Our approach is evaluated on three
conversational datasets Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin achieving new
state-of-the-art performance among NT models and substantially narrowing the
gap with AED-based systems.

*Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Luisa Bentivogli,Andre Martins,Giuseppe Attanasio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语音翻译模型中隐藏状态是否捕捉到说话者性别特征，并分析了性别编码对翻译的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音翻译模型是否像语音模型一样能捕捉说话者性别特征，以及这对翻译中性别分配的影响。

Method: 使用探测方法评估不同语音翻译模型中的性别编码能力，涵盖三种语言方向（英语-法语/意大利语/西班牙语）。

Result: 传统编码器-解码器模型能捕捉性别信息，但新型架构（通过适配器整合语音编码器和机器翻译系统）则不能。性别编码能力低的模型更倾向于默认男性翻译。

Conclusion: 新型语音翻译架构在性别编码上表现较差，导致翻译中更明显的男性默认偏见。

Abstract: Recent studies on interpreting the hidden states of speech models have shown
their ability to capture speaker-specific features, including gender. Does this
finding also hold for speech translation (ST) models? If so, what are the
implications for the speaker's gender assignment in translation? We address
these questions from an interpretability perspective, using probing methods to
assess gender encoding across diverse ST models. Results on three language
directions (English-French/Italian/Spanish) indicate that while traditional
encoder-decoder models capture gender information, newer architectures --
integrating a speech encoder with a machine translation system via adapters --
do not. We also demonstrate that low gender encoding capabilities result in
systems' tendency toward a masculine default, a translation bias that is more
pronounced in newer architectures.

Motivation: 随着AI影响力的增加，其可能放大错误信息并加深社会分歧，尤其是在公共健康等关键领域。

Method: 通过AI辩论和咨询协议，研究人类和AI法官在评估COVID-19事实性声明时的表现。

Result: AI辩论显著提高判断准确性，尤其是主流信念持有者（+15.2%），AI法官表现优于人类法官（78.5% vs. 70.1%）。

Conclusion: AI辩论是一种有前景的监督方法，能结合人类和AI的多样性判断，减少偏见并接近真相。

Abstract: As AI grows more powerful, it will increasingly shape how we understand the
world. But with this influence comes the risk of amplifying misinformation and
deepening social divides-especially on consequential topics like public health
where factual accuracy directly impacts well-being. Scalable Oversight aims to
ensure AI truthfulness by enabling humans to supervise systems that may exceed
human capabilities--yet humans themselves hold different beliefs and biases
that impair their judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges
toward the truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of
controversial COVID-19 factuality claims where people hold strong prior
beliefs. We conduct two studies: one with human judges holding either
mainstream or skeptical beliefs evaluating factuality claims through
AI-assisted debate or consultancy protocols, and a second examining the same
problem with personalized AI judges designed to mimic these different human
belief systems. In our human study, we find that debate-where two AI advisor
systems present opposing evidence-based arguments-consistently improves
judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, outperforming consultancy with a
single-advisor system by 10% overall. The improvement is most significant for
judges with mainstream beliefs (+15.2% accuracy), though debate also helps
skeptical judges who initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views
(+4.7% accuracy). In our AI judge study, we find that AI judges with human-like
personas achieve even higher accuracy (78.5%) than human judges (70.1%) and
default AI judges without personas (69.8%), suggesting their potential for
supervising frontier AI models. These findings highlight AI debate as a
promising path toward scalable, bias-resilient oversight--leveraging both
diverse human and AI judgments to move closer to truth in contested domains.

### [16] [Echoes of Phonetics: Unveiling Relevant Acoustic Cues for ASR via Feature Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02181)
*Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Mauro Cettolo,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过特征归因技术分析了现代Conformer-based ASR系统依赖的声学线索，发现其对元音、摩擦音和爆破音的特定声学特性有不同偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术取得显著进展，但模型依赖的具体声学线索仍不明确，且以往研究仅限于少量音素和过时模型。

Method: 应用特征归因技术，分析元音、摩擦音和爆破音的声学特性在时间和频率域中的表现。

Result: ASR模型更依赖元音的完整时间跨度（尤其是前两个共振峰），对男性语音更敏感；对摩擦音中的咝音谱特性捕捉更好；爆破音中更关注释放阶段（尤其是爆破特性）。

Conclusion: 研究提升了ASR模型的可解释性，并指出未来研究可探索模型鲁棒性的潜在不足。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in ASR, the specific acoustic cues models rely
on remain unclear. Prior studies have examined such cues on a limited set of
phonemes and outdated models. In this work, we apply a feature attribution
technique to identify the relevant acoustic cues for a modern Conformer-based
ASR system. By analyzing plosives, fricatives, and vowels, we assess how
feature attributions align with their acoustic properties in the time and
frequency domains, also essential for human speech perception. Our findings
show that the ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans, particularly their
first two formants, with greater saliency in male speech. It also better
captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives than non-sibilants
and prioritizes the release phase in plosives, especially burst
characteristics. These insights enhance the interpretability of ASR models and
highlight areas for future research to uncover potential gaps in model
robustness.

*Lindia Tjuatja,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BehaviorBox的自动比较语言模型的方法，通过性能感知的上下文嵌入找到两个模型在细粒度文本特征上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型评估任务复杂且模糊，需要找到能够展示模型间差异的通用示例，以理解模型的优缺点。

Method: 使用性能感知的上下文嵌入，提取细粒度特征（如特定上下文中的词汇或标点），展示两个模型在生成能力上的差异。

Result: BehaviorBox成功识别出模型在特定上下文中的性能差异，这些差异无法通过语料库级别的困惑度等传统指标发现。

Conclusion: BehaviorBox为语言模型比较提供了自动化和细粒度的分析工具，揭示了传统评估方法无法捕捉的性能差异。

Abstract: Language model evaluation is a daunting task: prompts are brittle,
corpus-level perplexities are vague, and the choice of benchmarks are endless.
Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two
LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can
this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for
automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual
embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms
another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that
demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs.
Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in
fine-grained contexts, such as "conditional 'were' in the phrase 'if you were'"
and "exclamation marks after emotional statements", where one model outperforms
another within a particular datatset. We apply BehaviorBox to compare models
that vary in size, model family, and post-training, and enumerate insights into
specific contexts that illustrate meaningful differences in performance which
cannot be found by measures such as corpus-level perplexity alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在计算声学特征时可能忽略细粒度变化，本研究旨在通过识别语义重要片段来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型提取词信息量，选择关键片段后计算声学特征，结合标准声学特征和自监督表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于词信息量选择的片段显著提高了情感识别的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚焦语义重要片段，有效提升了情感识别的准确性。

Abstract: In emotion recognition from speech, a key challenge lies in identifying
speech signal segments that carry the most relevant acoustic variations for
discerning specific emotions. Traditional approaches compute functionals for
features such as energy and F0 over entire sentences or longer speech portions,
potentially missing essential fine-grained variation in the long-form
statistics. This research investigates the use of word informativeness, derived
from a pre-trained language model, to identify semantically important segments.
Acoustic features are then computed exclusively for these identified segments,
enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology utilizes standard
acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised
representations. Results indicate a notable improvement in recognition
performance when features are computed on segments selected based on word
informativeness, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach.

TL;DR: CoDial框架通过将专家知识转化为可执行的对话逻辑，简化了领域专用对话系统的构建，支持非技术专家轻松定义和优化系统行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于专家知识、训练数据的高成本和技术的复杂性，构建领域专用对话系统具有挑战性。需要一种框架，使非技术专家能够轻松定义和优化系统行为。

Method: CoDial框架将专家知识表示为结构化异构图，并转化为可执行的对话逻辑，支持在现有护栏语言（如Colang）中实现零样本任务导向对话系统。

Result: CoDial在STAR数据集上达到最先进的性能，在MultiWOZ数据集上与类似基线竞争，并通过人工和LLM辅助反馈实现迭代改进。

Conclusion: CoDial是一个实用的工具，支持专家在高风险领域中对LLM进行指导对齐。

Abstract: It is often challenging to teach specialized, unseen tasks to dialogue
systems due to the high cost of expert knowledge, training data, and high
technical difficulty. To support domain-specific applications - such as law,
medicine, or finance - it is essential to build frameworks that enable
non-technical experts to define, test, and refine system behaviour with minimal
effort. Achieving this requires cross-disciplinary collaboration between
developers and domain specialists. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), that converts expert knowledge,
represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, into executable
conversation logic. CoDial can be easily implemented in existing guardrailing
languages, such as Colang, to enable interpretable, modifiable, and true
zero-shot specification of task-oriented dialogue systems. Empirically, CoDial
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STAR dataset for inference-based
models and is competitive with similar baselines on the well-known MultiWOZ
dataset. We also demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and
LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of
LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ImpRAG是一个无需显式查询的检索增强生成系统，通过统一模型整合检索和生成，提升任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统将检索和生成分离，限制了模型在多样化任务中的泛化能力。

Method: ImpRAG将预训练解码器语言模型分为专用层组，同时优化检索和生成任务，采用两阶段推理过程。

Result: 在8个知识密集型任务中，ImpRAG在未见任务上实现了3.6-11.5的精确匹配分数提升。

Conclusion: ImpRAG通过平衡检索和生成参数，利用生成困惑度作为检索训练目标，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems traditionally treat retrieval
and generation as separate processes, requiring explicit textual queries to
connect them. This separation can limit the ability of models to generalize
across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose a query-free RAG system, named
ImpRAG, which integrates retrieval and generation into a unified model. ImpRAG
allows models to implicitly express their information needs, eliminating the
need for human-specified queries. By dividing pretrained decoder-only language
models into specialized layer groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation
tasks simultaneously. Our approach employs a two-stage inference process, using
the same model parameters and forward pass for both retrieval and generation,
thereby minimizing the disparity between retrievers and language models.
Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that ImpRAG achieves
3.6-11.5 improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks with diverse
formats, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling models to articulate their
own information needs and generalize across tasks. Our analysis underscores the
importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging
generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced
performance.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析网球赛后采访的韵律特征和自监督学习（SSL）表示，探讨了仅凭采访录音分类比赛胜负的潜力。结果表明，SSL表示能有效区分胜负，而韵律特征（如音高变化）也是胜利的强指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索赛后采访中的韵律特征是否能反映比赛结果，并验证自监督学习在分类任务中的有效性。

Method: 通过提取传统声学特征和深度语音表示（如Wav2Vec 2.0和HuBERT），结合机器学习分类器，分析音高和强度等韵律特征。

Result: SSL表示能有效区分胜负，捕捉与情绪状态相关的细微语音模式；韵律特征（如音高变化）是胜利的强指标。

Conclusion: 赛后采访的韵律特征和SSL表示可用于分类比赛结果，为情绪分析和语音研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: This study examines the prosodic characteristics associated with winning and
losing in post-match tennis interviews. Additionally, this research explores
the potential to classify match outcomes solely based on post-match interview
recordings using prosodic features and self-supervised learning (SSL)
representations. By analyzing prosodic elements such as pitch and intensity,
alongside SSL models like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT, the aim is to determine
whether an athlete has won or lost their match. Traditional acoustic features
and deep speech representations are extracted from the data, and machine
learning classifiers are employed to distinguish between winning and losing
players. Results indicate that SSL representations effectively differentiate
between winning and losing outcomes, capturing subtle speech patterns linked to
emotional states. At the same time, prosodic cues -- such as pitch variability
-- remain strong indicators of victory.

Motivation: 解决大型动作模型（LAMs）在多步骤任务中因缺乏高质量训练数据而面临的挑战。

Method: 提出LAM SIMULATOR框架，包括动态任务查询生成器、工具库和交互环境，使LLM代理能自主探索任务并生成训练数据。

Result: 在ToolBench和CRMArena基准测试中，使用自生成数据的模型性能提升高达49.3%。

Conclusion: LAM SIMULATOR高效且有效，减少了人工干预，加速了AI代理的开发。

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) for AI Agents offer incredible potential but face
challenges due to the need for high-quality training data, especially for
multi-steps tasks that involve planning, executing tool calls, and responding
to feedback. To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive
framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality
feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive
collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model
(LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables
LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery
of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action
trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for
LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena,
highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with
self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance
gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR
requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM
SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“语法提示”的方法，通过先解释语法规则再处理句子，显著提升了语言模型在语法判断任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）能够解释语法规则，但在实际判断句子可接受性时表现不佳。研究旨在缩小模型“知道规则”与“应用规则”之间的差距。

Method: 采用“解释-处理”范式（grammar prompting），先由大型LLM生成语法现象的解释，再将解释作为上下文输入目标模型（LLM或小型语言模型SLM）进行句子判断。

Result: 在多个语言基准测试中，该方法显著优于基线模型，尤其对小型语言模型（SLMs）效果明显，平均缩小了LLM与SLM的准确率差距约20%（结合思维链时达56%）。

Conclusion: 语法提示是一种轻量级、语言无关的方法，能有效提升低成本SLMs在多语言环境中的表现，使其接近前沿LLM的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules, yet they often
fail to apply those rules when judging sentence acceptability. We present
"grammar prompting", an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first
produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that
explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model -- either an
LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) -- before deciding which sentence of a
minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian
RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements
over strong baselines across many syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM's
metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between
knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average
LLM-SLM accuracy gap by about 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by
56% (13.0 pp -> 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost. The lightweight,
language-agnostic cue lets low-cost SLMs approach frontier-LLM performance in
multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量作者归属错误公平性的指标MAUIk，并发现现有模型在公平性上表现不佳，某些作者面临更高的误判风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者归属错误在现实生活中可能带来严重后果，尤其是在法医场景中。现有评估方法未明确考虑公平性，因此需要一种新的衡量标准。

Method: 引入Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk)，基于作者在未撰写文本中被误判为前k名的频率，评估五种模型在两个数据集上的公平性。

Result: 所有模型均表现出较高的不公平性，某些作者风险更高；误判风险与作者在潜在搜索空间中的向量嵌入位置相关，靠近中心的作者风险更大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了作者归属模型的潜在危害，建议在模型构建和使用时与终端用户沟通并校准误判风险。

Abstract: Authorship misattribution can have profound consequences in real life. In
forensic settings simply being considered as one of the potential authors of an
evidential piece of text or communication can result in undesirable scrutiny.
This raises a fairness question: Is every author in the candidate pool at equal
risk of misattribution? Standard evaluation measures for authorship attribution
systems do not explicitly account for this notion of fairness. We introduce a
simple measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), which is based on how
often authors are ranked in the top k for texts they did not write. Using this
measure we quantify the unfairness of five models on two different datasets.
All models exhibit high levels of unfairness with increased risks for some
authors. Furthermore, we find that this unfairness relates to how the models
embed the authors as vectors in the latent search space. In particular, we
observe that the risk of misattribution is higher for authors closer to the
centroid (or center) of the embedded authors in the haystack. These results
indicate the potential for harm and the need for communicating with and
calibrating end users on misattribution risk when building and providing such
models for downstream use.

TL;DR: TRuST是一个综合数据集，用于改进毒性检测，包含毒性、目标社会群体和毒性范围的标签。研究发现，微调模型在毒性检测上优于零样本和少样本提示，但某些社会群体的性能仍较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线内容中的毒性问题对心理和社会有负面影响，需要改进毒性检测方法。

Method: 引入TRuST数据集，结合现有数据并扩展标签，评估大型语言模型在毒性检测、目标群体识别和毒性范围提取上的表现。

Result: 微调模型表现优于零样本和少样本提示，但对某些社会群体的检测性能仍不足，且推理能力未显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在社会推理能力上较弱，需进一步改进毒性检测技术。

Abstract: Toxicity in online content, including content generated by language models,
has become a critical concern due to its potential for negative psychological
and social impact. This paper introduces TRuST, a comprehensive dataset
designed to improve toxicity detection that merges existing datasets, and has
labels for toxicity, target social group, and toxic spans. It includes a
diverse range of target groups such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability,
and politics, with both human/machine-annotated and human machine-generated
data. We benchmark state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on toxicity
detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. We find that
fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot and few-shot prompting,
though performance remains low for certain social groups. Further, reasoning
capabilities do not significantly improve performance, indicating that LLMs
have weak social reasoning skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对现有大型推理模型（如R1）的依赖，推动独立开发大型推理模型（LRM）。

Method: 利用短链推理LLM构建长链推理数据集（Long CoT Collection），并通过管道技术引入新的推理策略。

Result: 数据集质量接近R1，训练后的模型在推理能力和强化学习方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 独立构建的长链推理数据集为LRM开发提供了可行路径，并展示了在推理和强化学习中的潜力。

Abstract: With the release of R1, a publicly available large reasoning model (LRM),
researchers commonly train new LRMs by training language models on R1's long
chain-of-thought (CoT) inferences. While prior works show that LRMs'
capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued
reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in
advancing the field. As a first step toward independent LRM development, this
paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs
that are not trained for inference-time scaling. To this end, we present the
Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing
short CoT LLMs. We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning
strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing
controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking
problem. Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality
comparable to--or slightly below--R1. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate
that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but
also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models
initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Storyteller的新方法，通过基于语言学的SVO三元组和动态模块（STORYLINE与NEKG）提升自动生成故事的连贯性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在自动故事生成中难以保持叙事连贯性和逻辑一致性，影响了整体体验，因此需要改进。

Method: 引入基于SVO三元组的剧情节点结构，结合动态模块STORYLINE和NEKG，持续优化故事生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，Storyteller在人类偏好评估中平均胜率达84.33%，且在创意、连贯性、吸引力和相关性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Storyteller通过系统性改进，显著提升了自动生成故事的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: Stories are central to human culture, serving to share ideas, preserve
traditions, and foster connections. Automatic story generation, a key
advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), offers new possibilities for
creating personalized content, exploring creative ideas, and enhancing
interactive experiences. However, existing methods struggle to maintain
narrative coherence and logical consistency. This disconnect compromises the
overall storytelling experience, underscoring the need for substantial
improvements. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce Storyteller,
a novel approach that systemically improves the coherence and consistency of
automatically generated stories. Storyteller introduces a plot node structure
based on linguistically grounded subject verb object (SVO) triplets, which
capture essential story events and ensure a consistent logical flow. Unlike
previous methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules, the STORYLINE and
narrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG),that continuously interact with the
story generation process. This integration produces structurally sound,
cohesive and immersive narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Storyteller significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 84.33%
average win rate through human preference evaluation. At the same time, it is
also far ahead in other aspects including creativity, coherence, engagement,
and relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TruthOverTricks，一个评估虚假信息检测中捷径学习的统一范式，揭示了现有检测器的性能问题，并提出了SMF框架以增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息检测模型依赖训练数据中的表面线索（捷径），难以泛化到真实世界的多样化虚假信息，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的虚假信息。

Method: TruthOverTricks将捷径行为分类为内在和外在诱导，评估了7种检测器在14个基准和2个新数据集上的表现，并提出了SMF框架（基于LLM的数据增强）。

Result: 实验显示现有检测器在自然和对抗性捷径下性能显著下降，而SMF通过增强语义理解提升了16个基准上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SMF有效减少了模型对捷径的依赖，推动了虚假信息检测的发展，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e.,
\emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail
to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation.
This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily
generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce
TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning
in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors
into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and
evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along
with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo.
Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance
degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted
shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation
framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual
summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances
robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic
understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of
misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at
https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.

Method: DIAMOND整合了棒球统计指标（如Win Expectancy、WPA和Leverage Index）与LLM模块，通过定量和定性结合的方式选择高光时刻。

Result: 在五场韩国棒球联盟比赛中，DIAMOND的F1分数从42.9%（仅WPA）提升至84.8%，优于商业和统计基线。

Conclusion: DIAMOND展示了模块化、可解释的智能体框架在体育及其他领域事件级总结中的潜力。

Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking
or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but
often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual
curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable.
We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight
summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language
reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and
Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances
selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures
both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of
purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean
Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9%
(WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines.
Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular,
interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports
and beyond.

Result: 微调后LLM输出安全性提升且不影响通用回答的实用性；12个日本LLM的安全评估结果。

Conclusion: AnswerCarelessly数据集有效提升LLM安全性，并支持多语言和地区的数据集扩展。

Abstract: In this paper we present AnswerCarefully, a dataset for promoting the safety
and appropriateness of Japanese LLM outputs. The dataset consists of 1,800
pairs of questions and reference answers, where the questions require special
attention in answering. It covers a wide range of risk categories established
in prior English-language datasets, but the data samples are original in that
they are manually created to reflect the socio-cultural context of LLM usage in
Japan. We show that using this dataset for instruction to fine-tune a Japanese
LLM led to improved output safety without compromising the utility of general
responses. We also report the results of a safety evaluation of 12 Japanese
LLMs using this dataset as a benchmark. Finally, we describe the latest update
on the dataset which provides English translations and annotations of the
questions, aimed at facilitating the derivation of similar datasets in
different languages and regions.

TL;DR: X²-ICL框架通过系统探索所有可能标签的解释，提升了上下文学习的鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在分布外数据上泛化能力不足，X-ICL通过引入解释提升了可靠性，但仍需进一步优化。

Method: 提出X²-ICL框架，系统探索所有可能标签的解释，以增强模型的决策能力。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解数据集上验证，X²-ICL显著提升了分布外数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: X²-ICL通过全面解释标签，为上下文学习提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond
the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in
enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves
prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the
reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an
advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations
for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and
robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language
understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating
significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the
existing ICL approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的协同机制Consultant Decoding (CD)，通过改进验证机制，显著提升了大型语言模型(LLM)的推理速度，同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Speculative Decoding (SD)方法因高拒绝率导致重复调用LLM，降低了效率。

Method: CD采用基于LLM计算的token级似然性验证候选草案，而非SD的重要性采样指标。

Result: CD实现了推理速度最高2.5倍的提升，生成质量接近目标模型的100%，且大模型调用频率降至10%以下。

Conclusion: CD不仅效率高，性能甚至超过理论上限的SD目标模型。

Abstract: The synergistic mechanism based on Speculative Decoding (SD) has garnered
considerable attention as a simple yet effective approach for accelerating the
inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the high rejection
rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the
overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification
mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD).
Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for
verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods
computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference
speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation
quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is
achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of
magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model
to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even
found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents
the upper bound for speculative decoding.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench能够量化基于图的结构化如何提升模型推理能力，为GraphRAG模型的进一步研究和优化提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing
recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by
structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex
reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely
on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions
and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity
improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce
GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\)
Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions
that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content
retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions
require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage.
The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice,
true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16
disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework.
GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG
pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer
generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence
of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to
GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based
structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals
critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning
capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

Method: 研究采用自然语言处理技术，包括字符计数、优先提及顺序、TF-IDF词频分析、专有名词性别模式识别、大语言模型区分性别词列表能力测试，以及GloVe嵌入分析关键词与性别的关联。

Result: 结果显示所有地区的教科书均存在性别不平等，男性角色在数量、优先提及和命名实体上被过度代表，拉丁文化圈的不平等程度最低。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了跨文化背景下教科书中的性别不平等现象，强调了全球范围内性别平等的教育内容改革的必要性。

Abstract: Textbooks play a critical role in shaping children's understanding of the
world. While previous studies have identified gender inequality in individual
countries' textbooks, few have examined the issue cross-culturally. This study
applies natural language processing methods to quantify gender inequality in
English textbooks from 22 countries across 7 cultural spheres. Metrics include
character count, firstness (which gender is mentioned first), and TF-IDF word
associations by gender. The analysis also identifies gender patterns in proper
names appearing in TF-IDF word lists, tests whether large language models can
distinguish between gendered word lists, and uses GloVe embeddings to examine
how closely keywords associate with each gender. Results show consistent
overrepresentation of male characters in terms of count, firstness, and named
entities. All regions exhibit gender inequality, with the Latin cultural sphere
showing the least disparity.

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information
extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex
relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of
three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation
classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures
explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task
decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation
mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation.
In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time
cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their
performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments
demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard
few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These
findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable
LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction. The source codes and

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在国籍角色扮演中是否表现出情感刻板印象，以及这些情感分配是否符合文化规范。

Method: 通过分析预训练LLMs对不同国籍角色的情感分配（如羞耻、恐惧、快乐），并与人类情感反应对比。

Result: 发现LLMs存在国籍相关的情感差异，且对负面情感的处理与人类反应不一致，显示出潜在的偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs在情感分配中存在刻板印象和偏见，需进一步优化以减少文化偏差。

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental facet of human experience, varying across
individuals, cultural contexts, and nationalities. Given the recent success of
Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs
exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas.
Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in
pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions
align with cultural norms. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based
differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being
disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable
misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly
for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially
biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.

Result: 实验表明，具备解密能力的模型可能因不匹配泛化攻击导致安全机制失效，产生不安全响应或过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 本文为理解LLM在长尾文本场景中的安全性提供了基础，并指出了开发鲁棒安全机制的方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs)
behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety
implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM
safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated
instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful
responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that
possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to
mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one
safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these
findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss
their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the
safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for
developing robust safety mechanisms.

crucial. However, the scarcity of high-quality data remains a fundamental
challenge to evaluating and improving this capability. Traditional dataset
construction methods are labor-intensive, resource-demanding, and raise privacy

Conclusion: FDV和Multimodal DeepResearcher框架有效解决了多模态报告生成的挑战，提升了可视化与文本的结合能力。

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and
information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation
have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate
comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks
primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated
generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel
task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and
effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we
propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual
representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse,
high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce
Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into
four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning,
and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated
multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100
diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive
experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness
of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet

TL;DR: 论文提出MidPO框架，通过混合专家（MoE）方法优化安全性和实用性，解决了现有方法在平衡两者时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，如何在保持实用性的同时增强安全性成为关键挑战。现有方法在平衡两者时存在不足。

Method: MidPO首先通过单偏好优化将基础模型转化为安全和实用性专家，再通过MoE框架和动态路由机制自适应平衡两者。

Result: 实验表明，MidPO在安全和实用性上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MidPO为LLM的安全性和实用性优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied across various
domains, enhancing safety while maintaining the helpfulness of LLMs has become
a critical challenge. Recent studies solve this problem through
safety-constrained online preference optimization or safety-constrained offline
preference optimization. However, the safety-constrained online methods often
suffer from excessive safety, which might reduce helpfulness, while the
safety-constrained offline methods perform poorly in adaptively balancing
safety and helpfulness. To address these limitations, we propose MidPO, a
\textbf{\underline{Mi}}xture of Experts (MoE) framework for safety-helpfulness
\textbf{\underline{d}}ual \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization. Firstly, MidPO devises single-preference
enhanced direct preference optimization approach to transform the base model
into two independent experts, termed safety and helpfulness experts, and
fine-tunes the two independent experts for optimal safety or helpfulness
performance. Secondly, to achieve an effective balance between safety and
helpfulness, MidPO incorporates the two experts into the MoE framework and
designs a dynamic routing mechanism to allocate contributions from each expert
adaptively. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three
popular datasets to demonstrate the proposed MidPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both safety and helpfulness. The code and models
will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了XToM，一个多语言基准测试，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在不同语言环境中的心智理论（ToM）能力，发现LLM在多语言理解上表现优异，但在ToM任务中表现参差不齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对LLM心智理论的评估主要集中在英语，忽略了语言多样性对人类认知的影响，因此需要研究LLM是否具备跨语言的心智理论能力。

Method: 开发了XToM基准测试，覆盖五种语言，包含多样化的任务场景，并系统评估了LLM（如DeepSeek R1）的表现。

Result: LLM在多语言理解上表现优异，但在ToM任务中表现因语言而异，未能完全复现人类跨语言的心智推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM在跨语言心智理论能力上存在局限性，需要进一步改进以更好地模拟人类认知。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer mental states in others, is
pivotal for human social cognition. Existing evaluations of ToM in LLMs are
largely limited to English, neglecting the linguistic diversity that shapes
human cognition. This limitation raises a critical question: can LLMs exhibit
Multilingual Theory of Mind, which is the capacity to reason about mental
states across diverse linguistic contexts? To address this gap, we present
XToM, a rigorously validated multilingual benchmark that evaluates ToM across
five languages and incorporates diverse, contextually rich task scenarios.
Using XToM, we systematically evaluate LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1), revealing a
pronounced dissonance: while models excel in multilingual language
understanding, their ToM performance varies across languages. Our findings
expose limitations in LLMs' ability to replicate human-like mentalizing across
linguistic contexts.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，微调成为增强特定场景性能的有效方法，但传统模型合并方法在参数高效微调场景中任务干扰问题显著。

Method: 改进RegMean方法，提出FroM方法，直接使用Frobenius范数测量模型参数，引入额外超参数控制合并过程。

Result: FroM在多种微调场景中优于基线方法，显著缓解任务干扰问题。

Conclusion: FroM是一种无需训练数据的自适应合并方法，有效提升模型合并性能。

Abstract: With the development of large language models, fine-tuning has emerged as an
effective method to enhance performance in specific scenarios by injecting
domain-specific knowledge. In this context, model merging techniques provide a
solution for fusing knowledge from multiple fine-tuning models by combining
their parameters. However, traditional methods often encounter task
interference when merging full fine-tuning models, and this problem becomes
even more evident in parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce an improvement to the RegMean method, which indirectly leverages
the training data to approximate the outputs of the linear layers before and
after merging. We propose an adaptive merging method called FroM, which
directly measures the model parameters using the Frobenius norm, without any
training data. By introducing an additional hyperparameter for control, FroM
outperforms baseline methods across various fine-tuning scenarios, alleviating
the task interference problem.

TL;DR: ORPP（优化角色扮演提示）是一种通过优化和生成角色扮演提示来提升大语言模型性能的框架，其核心思想是将提示搜索空间限制在角色扮演场景中，从而激活模型的内在能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法存在计算开销高或依赖模型优化能力的局限性，限制了其广泛应用。ORPP旨在通过角色扮演提示优化解决这些问题。

Method: ORPP首先在小规模训练样本上进行迭代优化生成高质量角色扮演提示，然后利用模型的少样本学习能力将优化经验迁移到其他样本。

Result: 实验表明，ORPP在性能上不仅匹配且多数情况下超越现有主流提示优化方法，并展现出卓越的即插即用能力。

Conclusion: ORPP通过角色扮演提示优化显著提升模型性能，且具备广泛兼容性，可与其他提示方法结合进一步优化效果。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for eliciting outstanding performance from
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Existing research has explored
model-driven strategies for prompt optimization. However, these methods often
suffer from high computational overhead or require strong optimization
capabilities from the model itself, which limits their broad applicability.To
address these challenges, we propose ORPP (Optimized Role-Playing Prompt),a
framework that enhances model performance by optimizing and generating
role-playing prompts. The core idea of ORPP is to confine the prompt search
space to role-playing scenarios, thereby fully activating the model's intrinsic
capabilities through carefully crafted, high-quality role-playing prompts.
Specifically, ORPP first performs iterative optimization on a small subset of
training samples to generate high-quality role-playing prompts. Then,
leveraging the model's few-shot learning capability, it transfers the
optimization experience to efficiently generate suitable prompts for the
remaining samples.Our experimental results show that ORPP not only matches but
in most cases surpasses existing mainstream prompt optimization methods in
terms of performance. Notably, ORPP demonstrates superior "plug-and-play"
capability. In most cases, it can be integrated with various other prompt
methods and further enhance their effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索短形式测试是否能准确反映LLMs在长形式输出中的价值观偏好，以填补实际应用中价值观相关风险的空白。

Method: 比较五种LLMs（llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, olmo-7b）在短形式反应和长形式响应中的价值观偏好，并分析长形式生成属性与偏好的关系。

Result: 短形式与长形式偏好相关性弱；不同长形式设置间相关性也弱；对齐仅略微提升一致性；论据特异性与偏好强度负相关，场景覆盖与偏好正相关。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健的方法以确保LLMs在不同应用中价值观表达的一致性。

Abstract: Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on
short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves
long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences
in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value
preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in
long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences
elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number
of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences.
Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b),
we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from
short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2)
similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct
long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the
consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation
attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity
negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across
scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust methods to ensure consistent value expression across diverse
applications.

TL;DR: NSAR结合神经与符号推理，通过提取符号事实和生成Python代码，显著提升多目标推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长上下文场景中多目标推理的困难。

Method: 结合神经与符号推理，提取符号事实并生成可执行Python代码。

Result: 在七种语言和不同上下文长度下，NSAR显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 神经与符号推理结合在多语言环境中具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to perform multi-target reasoning
in long-context scenarios where relevant information is scattered across
extensive documents. To address this challenge, we introduce NeuroSymbolic
Augmented Reasoning (NSAR), which combines the benefits of neural and symbolic
reasoning during inference. NSAR explicitly extracts symbolic facts from text
and generates executable Python code to handle complex reasoning steps. Through
extensive experiments across seven languages and diverse context lengths, we
demonstrate that NSAR significantly outperforms both a vanilla RAG baseline and
advanced prompting strategies in accurately identifying and synthesizing
multiple pieces of information. Our results highlight the effectiveness of
combining explicit symbolic operations with neural inference for robust,
interpretable, and scalable reasoning in multilingual settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视文本到图像（T2I）生成任务的评估能力开发及大规模人类评估数据的整合。

Method: 提出Minos-Corpus数据集，结合人类和GPT数据；采用数据选择与平衡、Mix-SFT训练方法及DPO技术开发Minos模型。

Result: Minos在类似规模的开源评估模型中表现最优，尤其在T2I任务上超越所有开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 高质量人类评估数据及联合训练I2T和T2I任务数据对提升评估性能至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid
progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general
evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the
development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task,
and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper,
we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that
combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains
evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based
on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training
methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built
upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among
all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation
performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source
models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly
training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

TL;DR: KARE-RAG通过结构化知识表示、改进的训练目标和对比数据生成，显著提升了RAG管道的性能，尤其是在噪声文档处理方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG使LLMs能够访问更广泛的知识源，但检索文档中的噪声仍导致事实不一致，需要改进模型处理噪声内容的能力。

Method: 提出KARE-RAG，包括结构化知识表示、DDPO训练目标和对比数据生成管道，以优化知识利用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了RAG管道的性能，适用于不同规模和任务，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: 通过改进模型对检索内容的学习方式，KARE-RAG为RAG的优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access broader knowledge sources, yet factual inconsistencies persist due to
noise in retrieved documents-even with advanced retrieval methods. We
demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content
is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG
(Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge
utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge
representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense
Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that
prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data
generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying
factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances
standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and
out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities.
Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting
data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies.
Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how
models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across
diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on
Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要依赖新闻或财报，难以捕捉金融会议的真实动态，因此需要更贴近实际的评估工具。

Method: 构建了支持英语、中文和日语的$	exttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$数据集，涵盖多个行业和三项任务（摘要、问答对提取和问答）。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的长上下文模型在金融会议理解上仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: $	exttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$是一个有效的金融会议理解评估基准，展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
development of new benchmarks for evaluating their performance in the financial
domain. However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles,
earnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the
real-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a
novel benchmark called $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$, which is a multilingual,
multi-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting
understanding. First, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ supports English, Chinese, and
Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse
linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by
the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark
spans a broad range of financial activities. Finally,
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer
(QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and
comprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven
popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have
significant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting
comprehension skills.

Conclusion: FinChain为金融推理任务提供了可验证的中间步骤评估工具，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream
performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating
this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA
supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate
reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic
benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning.
Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five
parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and
domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python
trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy
adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for
automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning.
Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models
have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All
templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因版权和法律问题无法使用大型LLM的问题，同时提升小型模型的独立推理能力。

Method: 利用多样化生成和偏好优化技术，选择最优推理路径以提升任务表现。

Result: 在多个领域和数据集上优于基线方法，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: COLLATE为小型LLM提供了一种无需依赖大型模型的推理能力提升方案。

Abstract: LLMssuch as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions
by generating step-by-step rationales. Prior works have utilized this
capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters).
However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues,
owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed)
models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given
to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling
information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable
framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of
diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE
enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and
employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then
tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which
maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several
trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem
solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff
icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter
scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers
guided by the end task through ablations. Code is released here

Motivation: 高质量知识库资源稀缺且语言有限，需有效嵌入模型实现跨语言知识共享。

Method: 采用加权采样策略微调多语言嵌入模型，进行对比学习。

Result: 加权采样策略在MRR和Recall@3上分别提升31.03%和33.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法语言无关，适用于多语言和代码切换场景。

Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for
expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on
high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages,
therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different
languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language
becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to
transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones.
In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding
models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual
information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that
the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard
ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our
proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual
and code switching use cases.

Conclusion: 机器学习可以有效应对政治在线讨论中的问题，促进更高质量的交流。

Abstract: Political online participation in the form of discussing political issues and
exchanging opinions among citizens is gaining importance with more and more
formats being held digitally. To come to a decision, a careful discussion and
consideration of opinions and a civil exchange of arguments, which is defined
as the act of deliberation, is desirable. The quality of discussions and
participation processes in terms of their deliberativeness highly depends on
the design of platforms and processes. To facilitate online communication for
both participants and initiators, machine learning methods offer a lot of
potential. In this work we want to showcase which issues occur in political
online discussions and how machine learning can be used to counteract these
issues and enhance deliberation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现CoT提示在LLM中常导致冗长和冗余输出，增加了推理成本，假设许多推理步骤对正确答案并非必要。

Method: 通过系统研究确定模型达到稳定决策所需的最少推理步骤，并提出三种策略：基于答案一致性的早期停止、增强生成结束信号的概率，以及基于内部激活的监督方法。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个开源LLM上的实验表明，方法显著减少标记使用且准确性几乎无下降，其中NaturalQuestions上标记使用减少超40%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理时高效方法的重要性，为实际应用提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in large language models
(LLMs) but often leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thus increasing
inference cost. We hypothesize that many reasoning steps are unnecessary for
producing correct answers. To investigate this, we start with a systematic
study to examine what is the minimum reasoning required for a model to reach a
stable decision. We find that on math reasoning tasks like math, models
typically converge to their final answers after 60\% of the reasoning steps,
suggesting substantial redundancy in the remaining content. Based on these
insights, we propose three inference-time strategies to improve efficiency: (1)
early stopping via answer consistency, (2) boosting the probability of
generating end-of-reasoning signals, and (3) a supervised method that learns
when to stop based on internal activations. Experiments across five benchmarks
and five open-weights LLMs show that our methods significantly reduce token
usage with little or no accuracy drop. In particular, on NaturalQuestions,
Answer Consistency reduces tokens by over 40\% while further improving
accuracy. Our work underscores the importance of cost-effective reasoning
methods that operate at inference time, offering practical benefits for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态检索增强生成中的参数化与检索知识不一致（PRKI）及视觉与文本知识不一致（VTKI）问题。

Method: 提出四阶段流程：生成内部响应、选择多模态证据、生成外部响应、整合生成可靠答案，并通过专门训练范式优化。

Result: 在 KB-VQA 基准测试中，性能分别提升 5.6% 和 9.3%。

Conclusion: CoRe-MMRAG 有效解决了知识不一致性问题，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to
enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved
multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved
Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and
retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and
Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between
visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{C}r\textbf{o}ss-source knowledge
\textbf{Re}conciliation for \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{RAG}
(CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles
inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage
pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge,
then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity
assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to
produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm
enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified
answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG
achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6\% and
9.3\% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然强大，但计算资源需求高。现有剪枝方法通常关注保留模型的通用能力，但可能导致性能下降或需要后训练。

Method: Cus-Prun通过在语言、领域和任务三个维度上识别并剪枝无关神经元，生成专家模型。

Result: 实验表明，Cus-Prun在多种模型家族和尺寸中表现优于其他方法，专家和通用能力损失最小。

Conclusion: Cus-Prun是一种高效且无需后训练的剪枝方法，适用于生成轻量级专家模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational
resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it
is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who
often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios.
However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general
capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from
degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a
$\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to
prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is
positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying
and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates
expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that
$\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal
loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from
different model families and sizes.

Result: 现有印尼中心LLMs在非正式和本地语言环境中常生成不安全输出，而基于IndoSafety的微调显著提升安全性。

Conclusion: 强调文化基础安全评估的重要性，为多语言环境下负责任部署LLMs提供支持。

Abstract: Although region-specific large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
developed, their safety remains underexplored, particularly in culturally
diverse settings like Indonesia, where sensitivity to local norms is essential
and highly valued by the community. In this work, we present IndoSafety, the
first high-quality, human-verified safety evaluation dataset tailored for the
Indonesian context, covering five language varieties: formal and colloquial
Indonesian, along with three major local languages: Javanese, Sundanese, and
Minangkabau. IndoSafety is constructed by extending prior safety frameworks to
develop a taxonomy that captures Indonesia's sociocultural context. We find
that existing Indonesian-centric LLMs often generate unsafe outputs,
particularly in colloquial and local language settings, while fine-tuning on
IndoSafety significantly improves safety while preserving task performance. Our
work highlights the critical need for culturally grounded safety evaluation and
provides a concrete step toward responsible LLM deployment in multilingual
settings. Warning: This paper contains example data that may be offensive,

Motivation: 探索韵律在语言理解中的作用，尤其是独立于词汇内容时，韵律如何影响语言结构的可预测性。

Method: 提出Masked Prosody Model，利用自监督学习分析韵律的声学相关性，并通过探测实验比较其与传统特征（如音高、能量）的表现。

Result: SSL模型在涉及长期结构的任务（如情感识别）中表现优异，显著优于传统特征。

Conclusion: SSL训练目标的时间尺度对捕捉语言结构至关重要，且SSL编码的复杂结构比传统结构更具价值。

Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text
comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the
degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to
such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study
leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of
structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our
proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local
information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels
involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments
across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed
pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance
of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex
SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.

### [62] [On Generalization across Measurement Systems: LLMs Entail More Test-Time Compute for Underrepresented Cultures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02591)
*Minh Duc Bui,Kyung Eun Park,Goran Glavaš,Fabian David Schmidt,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同测量系统（如货币单位）下的表现，发现LLMs默认使用数据中占主导的测量系统，且性能在不同系统间不稳定。通过推理方法（如思维链）可以部分缓解问题，但会增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能像人类一样在不同测量系统中提供准确信息，以支持多元文化背景的用户。

Method: 使用新编译的数据集测试七种开源LLMs，探讨其默认测量系统、性能差异及推理方法的效果。

Result: LLMs默认使用数据中主导的测量系统，性能在不同系统间不稳定；推理方法可部分缓解问题，但增加计算成本。

Conclusion: LLMs在测量系统多样性方面存在不足，需进一步优化以减少对少数文化背景用户的边缘化。

Abstract: Measurement systems (e.g., currencies) differ across cultures, but the
conversions between them are well defined so that humans can state facts using
any measurement system of their choice. Being available to users from diverse
cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to
provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand.
Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source
LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system
used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their
accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate
potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our
findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in
the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in
performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in
part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought
(CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases
test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural
backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.

### [63] [Beyond the Surface: Measuring Self-Preference in LLM Judgments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02592)
*Zhi-Yuan Chen,Hao Wang,Xinyu Zhang,Enrui Hu,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评分方法（DBG分数），用于更准确地测量大型语言模型（LLM）作为评判者时的自我偏好偏差，避免了传统方法中偏差与响应质量的混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测量LLM的自我偏好偏差时，无法区分偏差与响应质量的影响，导致结果不准确。

Method: 引入黄金评判作为响应质量的真实标准，提出DBG分数，通过比较评判模型对自己响应和黄金评判的评分差异来测量偏差。

Result: 实验表明，DBG分数能有效消除响应质量对偏差测量的干扰，并分析了模型版本、规模和推理能力对偏差的影响。

Conclusion: DBG分数为测量自我偏好偏差提供了更可靠的方法，并探讨了影响偏差的因素及其潜在机制。

Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit self-preference
bias when serving as judges, meaning they tend to favor their own responses
over those generated by other models. Existing methods typically measure this
bias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to
its own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However,
this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as
higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score
differences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce
gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the
DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the
scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding
gold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG
score mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement.
Using the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess
self-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help
alleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data
of judge models. Finally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms of
self-preference bias from an attention-based perspective. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/zhiyuanc2001/self-preference.

### [64] [EssayBench: Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Genre Chinese Essay Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02596)
*Fan Gao,Dongyuan Li,Ding Xia,Fei Mi,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Baojun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\benchName的多类型中文写作基准，用于评估大型语言模型在四种主要文体中的表现，并开发了细粒度评分框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在中文写作评估中忽视了文体和修辞复杂性，需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 构建了728个真实提示，分为开放和约束两类，并设计了细粒度评分框架。

Result: 评估了15个大型语言模型，分析了其在不同文体和指令类型中的表现。

Conclusion: \benchName为中文写作评估提供了新基准，并推动了教育场景中写作生成的研究。

Abstract: Chinese essay writing and its evaluation are critical in educational
contexts, yet the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain
remain largely underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained
text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical
complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address
this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed
for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative,
Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world
prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the
\textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing
scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained,
genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We
further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human
agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their
strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName,
we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future
research on improving essay generation in educational settings.

### [65] [Overcoming Data Scarcity in Multi-Dialectal Arabic ASR via Whisper Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02627)
*Ömer Tarik Özyilmaz,Matt Coler,Matias Valdenegro-Toro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了微调OpenAI的Whisper模型对五种阿拉伯方言的自动语音识别效果，发现少量现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）微调数据对小模型有显著提升，而方言数据池化模型表现与方言专用模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业阿拉伯语ASR系统在处理方言语音时表现不佳，研究旨在探索如何通过微调和数据池化提升方言识别效果。

Method: 使用Mozilla Common Voice的MSA数据和MASC数据集的方言数据，评估MSA微调数据量、MSA预训练效果及方言专用与池化模型的性能。

Result: 少量MSA微调数据显著提升小模型性能；MSA预训练效果有限；方言池化模型与专用模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 方言数据池化在资源稀缺的ASR中可有效缓解数据不足问题，且不会显著降低性能。

Abstract: Although commercial Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems support
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they struggle with dialectal speech. We
investigate the effect of fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper on five major Arabic
dialects (Gulf, Levantine, Iraqi, Egyptian, Maghrebi) using Mozilla Common
Voice for MSA and the MASC dataset for dialectal speech. We evaluate MSA
training size effects, benefits of pre-training on MSA data, and
dialect-specific versus dialect-pooled models. We find that small amounts of
MSA fine-tuning data yield substantial improvements for smaller models,
matching larger non-fine-tuned models. While MSA pre-training shows minimal
benefit, suggesting limited shared features between MSA and dialects, our
dialect-pooled models perform comparably to dialect-specific ones. This
indicates that pooling dialectal data, when properly balanced, can help address
data scarcity in low-resource ASR without significant performance loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种标准化框架，用于分析具有特定角色的LLM的一致性，发现一致性受角色、刻板印象和模型设计的影响，且在不同任务中表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对不同角色和任务类型下LLM一致性的全面分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入标准化框架，定义一致性为模型在不同任务和运行中保持角色一致的能力，评估四种角色类别和多种任务维度。

Result: 一致性受角色、刻板印象和模型设计影响，且在结构化任务和更多上下文条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 本文框架为评估角色一致性提供了新方法，揭示了影响一致性的关键因素，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in diverse
applications, where they are assigned a specific persona - such as a happy high
school teacher - to guide their responses. While prior research has examined
how well LLMs adhere to predefined personas in writing style, a comprehensive
analysis of consistency across different personas and task types is lacking. In
this paper, we introduce a new standardized framework to analyze consistency in
persona-assigned LLMs. We define consistency as the extent to which a model
maintains coherent responses when assigned the same persona across different
tasks and runs. Our framework evaluates personas across four different
categories (happiness, occupation, personality, and political stance) spanning
multiple task dimensions (survey writing, essay generation, social media post
generation, single turn, and multi-turn conversations). Our findings reveal
that consistency is influenced by multiple factors, including the assigned
persona, stereotypes, and model design choices. Consistency also varies across
tasks, increasing with more structured tasks and additional context. All code
is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: EvaLearn是一个评估大语言模型学习能力和效率的新基准，包含648个挑战性问题，要求模型按顺序解决问题，并提供了五种自动化指标。测试发现不同模型表现差异显著，且静态能力强的模型在学习能力上未必占优。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基准多并行评估模型，而EvaLearn专注于评估模型在顺序任务中的学习能力和效率，填补了这一研究空白。

Method: EvaLearn包含182个任务序列，共648个问题，模型需按顺序解决。通过五种自动化指标评估模型表现，并测试了九种前沿模型。

Result: 不同模型表现各异，部分模型学习能力突出，部分则表现不佳。静态能力强的模型在学习能力上无显著优势。

Conclusion: EvaLearn为评估大语言模型潜力提供了新视角，揭示了模型与人类能力的差距，推动了更动态的评估方法发展。

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in
challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential.
EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into
182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most
existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models
to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained
from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics
to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We
extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance
profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial
performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to
benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we
investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that
instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model
learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static
abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all
tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model
performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for
assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human
capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation
approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results
studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长输出推理中的效率问题。

Method: 动态比例训练管道，平衡System-1和System-2数据权重，消除冗余推理。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B和14B上验证，输出标记减少40%，推理准确性不变。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需复杂数据标注或多模型插值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by
leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language
reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn
increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a
dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data
annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance
the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate
redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning
capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying
difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens
by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and
data will be available soon.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）取得了显著进展，但在规划任务中仍面临挑战，现有方法存在严格约束和级联错误的问题。

Method: 提出DPPM方法，包括任务分解、并行子任务规划、子计划合并，并加入验证与优化模块以纠正错误和解决冲突。

Result: 实验结果表明，DPPM在旅行规划任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPPM通过并行规划范式有效解决了LLM在规划任务中的限制，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), planning tasks
still present challenges for LLM-based agents. Existing planning methods face
two key limitations: heavy constraints and cascading errors. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel parallel planning paradigm, which Decomposes,
Plans for subtasks in Parallel, and Merges subplans into a final plan (DPPM).
Specifically, DPPM decomposes the complex task based on constraints into
subtasks, generates the subplan for each subtask in parallel, and merges them
into a global plan. In addition, our approach incorporates a verification and
refinement module, enabling error correction and conflict resolution.
Experimental results demonstrate that DPPM significantly outperforms existing
methods in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 解决高质量微调数据获取困难的问题，提升预训练模型的指令跟随能力和任务性能。

Result: 实验表明，使用BOOST-QA微调的模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂任务中推理能力显著提升。

Conclusion: MASTER为未来研究提供了有价值的思路，尤其在数据增强和模型性能提升方面。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models'
instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However,
obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to
data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we
propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data
through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We
simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging
multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction
data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented
from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5.
Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization.
Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex
tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型内部表示如何捕捉命名实体的提及，解决实体提及的歧义性和变异性问题。

Method: 提出基于聚类分析的框架，量化同一实体的提及是否聚类在一起，不同实体的提及是否分离。实验研究了五种基于Transformer的自回归模型。

Result: 模型在实体识别和区分上的表现类似精确率和召回率，范围在0.66到0.9之间。实体信息在早期层中以低维线性子空间紧凑表示。

Conclusion: 语言模型内部表示与真实世界中的实体知识结构存在同构关系，揭示了模型如何组织和利用实体信息。

Abstract: We analyze the extent to which internal representations of language models
(LMs) identify and distinguish mentions of named entities, focusing on the
many-to-many correspondence between entities and their mentions. We first
formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and
propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we
quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to
which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different
entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based
autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish
entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to
0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly
represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers.
Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations
influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through
the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge
structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally
organize and use entity information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在垂直领域中准确性、推理和可解释性不足的问题，传统偏好对齐方法忽视知识和推理逻辑。

Method: 提出RACE-Align框架，结合检索增强和链式思维推理，构建偏好数据集并使用DPO算法对齐模型。

Result: 在传统中医领域实验中，RACE-Align显著优于基础模型和仅用SFT微调的模型，提升准确性、推理深度和可解释性。

Conclusion: RACE-Align为增强大语言模型在复杂垂直领域的知识应用、推理可靠性和过程透明性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific
reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference
alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge
sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align
(Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel
framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically
constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support
and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO
algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction
strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing
knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of
domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference
dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively
generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that
RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model
fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed
across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness,
application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and
interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway
to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process
transparency in complex vertical domains.

Motivation: 探索如何利用自然文本（尤其是Twitter语料）增强常识知识库中的性别刻板印象行为数据。

Method: 使用OMCS和Twitter用户性别信息，结合语料库中的代词/姓名性别启发式方法，计算行为的性别偏见。

Result: Spearman相关系数为0.47，ROC曲线下面积为0.76，表明方法有效。

Conclusion: 利用自然文本（尤其是Twitter语料）增强常识知识库中的性别刻板印象行为数据是可行的。

Abstract: We extracted gender-specific actions from text corpora and Twitter, and
compared them to stereotypical expectations of people. We used Open Mind Common
Sense (OMCS), a commonsense knowledge repository, to focus on actions that are
pertinent to common sense and daily life of humans. We use the gender
information of Twitter users and Web-corpus-based pronoun/name gender
heuristics to compute the gender bias of the actions. With high recall, we
obtained a Spearman correlation of 0.47 between corpus-based predictions and a
human gold standard, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.76 when predicting
the polarity of the gold standard. We conclude that it is feasible to use
natural text (and a Twitter-derived corpus in particular) in order to augment
commonsense repositories with the stereotypical gender expectations of actions.
We also present a dataset of 441 commonsense actions with human judges' ratings
on whether the action is typically/slightly masculine/feminine (or neutral),
and another larger dataset of 21,442 actions automatically rated by the methods
we investigate in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中攻击性、暴力和粗俗语言的快速传播引发了社会和网络安全问题，而阿拉伯语因其复杂性、方言变体和标记数据稀缺，检测尤为困难。

Method: 通过多任务学习联合训练攻击性、暴力和粗俗语言检测任务，动态调整任务权重，并采用主动学习策略选择信息量大的样本进行训练。

Result: 在OSACT2022数据集上，该框架取得了85.42%的宏F1分数，优于现有方法且使用更少的微调样本。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合多任务学习和主动学习可在资源受限环境下高效准确地检测攻击性语言。

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media has amplified the spread of offensive,
violent, and vulgar speech, which poses serious societal and cybersecurity
concerns. Detecting such content in Arabic text is particularly complex due to
limited labeled data, dialectal variations, and the language's inherent
complexity. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task
learning (MTL) with active learning to enhance offensive speech detection in
Arabic social media text. By jointly training on two auxiliary tasks, violent
and vulgar speech, the model leverages shared representations to improve the
detection accuracy of the offensive speech. Our approach dynamically adjusts
task weights during training to balance the contribution of each task and
optimize performance. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we employ an
active learning strategy through several uncertainty sampling techniques to
iteratively select the most informative samples for model training. We also
introduce weighted emoji handling to better capture semantic cues. Experimental
results on the OSACT2022 dataset show that the proposed framework achieves a
state-of-the-art macro F1-score of 85.42%, outperforming existing methods while
using significantly fewer fine-tuning samples. The findings of this study
highlight the potential of integrating MTL with active learning for efficient
and accurate offensive language detection in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和英语词汇档案（EVP）进行细粒度词汇评估的新方法，以改进第二语言学习者的词汇水平评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词汇使用是第二语言（L2）熟练度的基本方面，但现有的自动化评估方法通常仅关注上下文无关或词性相关的词汇使用。

Method: 结合LLMs和EVP，通过上下文词汇使用与熟练度水平的关联，评估LLMs在L2学习者写作中为单词分配熟练度水平的能力。

Result: LLMs能够利用额外的语义信息，表现优于基于词性的基线方法，并显示出词汇水平与作文水平的相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs非常适合词汇评估任务，且该方法可用于验证EVP熟练度水平的一致性。

Abstract: Vocabulary use is a fundamental aspect of second language (L2) proficiency.
To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the
context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper
introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation
exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines
large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP
is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be
linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign
proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing,
addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and
multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to
exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We
also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level
proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the
EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of
vocabulary assessment.

TL;DR: HC-Bench测试显示，主流视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测隐藏内容（如光学幻觉或AI生成图像）时表现极差（0-5.36%准确率）。通过SemVink方法（降低图像分辨率至32-128像素），准确率提升至>99%，揭示了VLMs过度依赖高层语义而忽视低层视觉操作的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在检测隐藏内容（如光学幻觉或AI生成图像）时的表现，揭示其与人类视觉认知的差距。

Method: 提出HC-Bench基准测试（112张包含隐藏内容的图像），并设计SemVink方法（通过降低图像分辨率消除视觉噪声）。

Result: 主流VLMs在HC-Bench上表现极差（0-5.36%准确率），而SemVink方法显著提升准确率至>99%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在过度依赖高层语义的架构缺陷，需转向结合多尺度处理的混合模型，以提升实际应用中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core
human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated
images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a
benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing
that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit
prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to
an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink
(Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128
pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise.
This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning
over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work
urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging
the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in
medical imaging, security, and beyond.

*Ekaterina Grishina,Mikhail Gorbunov,Maxim Rakhuba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用正交变换优化预训练大语言模型（LLM）权重矩阵压缩的方法，以减少计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但需要大量计算和内存资源。结构化矩阵表示是减少参数数量的有效方法，但直接应用于预训练模型可能导致精度损失。

Method: 利用LLM输出在特定正交变换下不变的特性，识别能够显著提升权重矩阵压缩性的变换方法，适用于多种支持高效投影操作的结构化矩阵。

Result: 该方法能够在不损失模型性能的前提下，显著提升权重矩阵的压缩效率。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换优化结构化矩阵表示，为LLM的高效压缩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive results in natural
language processing tasks but require a significant amount of computational and
memory resources. Structured matrix representations are a promising way for
reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems
unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be
accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To
overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under
certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be
leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the
compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is
applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient
projection operations. Code is available at

*Yulin Dou,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TO-GATE通过轨迹优化提升LLM在多轮对话中生成问题与总结的能力，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自学习推理的方法难以识别最优对话轨迹并避免无关问题，限制了LLM在任务中的表现。

Method: 提出TO-GATE框架，包含生成最优提问轨迹的澄清解析器和确保任务对齐的总结器。

Result: 实验显示TO-GATE在偏好引导任务上比基线方法提升9.32%。

Conclusion: TO-GATE通过轨迹优化显著提升了LLM在多轮对话中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through
multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative
clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a
questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches
based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue
trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question
generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key
components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning
trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The
trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation
questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental
results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods,
achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.

*Ludovic Moncla,Hédi Zeghidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种命名实体识别（NER）方法在历史文本中的应用，包括传统方法和基于Transformer的模型，并提出了针对嵌套实体的分类框架。生成式模型在低资源场景下表现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文本中的NER面临非标准化语言、古旧拼写和嵌套实体等独特挑战，需要探索更有效的方法。

Method: 研究在GeoEDdA数据集上测试了多种NER方法，包括CRF、spaCy、CamemBERT和Flair，并提出基于标记和跨度的分类框架。还评估了生成式模型在低资源场景下的表现。

Result: 基于Transformer的模型在嵌套实体上表现最佳，而生成式模型在数据稀缺时具有潜力。

Conclusion: 历史NER仍面临挑战，未来可结合符号和神经方法以更好地处理早期现代法语文本的复杂性。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in historical texts presents unique challenges
due to non-standardized language, archaic orthography, and nested or
overlapping entities. This study benchmarks a diverse set of NER approaches,
ranging from classical Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and spaCy-based models
to transformer-based architectures such as CamemBERT and sequence-labeling
models like Flair. Experiments are conducted on the GeoEDdA dataset, a richly
annotated corpus derived from 18th-century French encyclopedias. We propose
framing NER as both token-level and span-level classification to accommodate
complex nested entity structures typical of historical documents. Additionally,
we evaluate the emerging potential of few-shot prompting with generative
language models for low-resource scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while
transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially on
nested entities, generative models offer promising alternatives when labeled
data are scarce. The study highlights ongoing challenges in historical NER and
suggests avenues for hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods to
better capture the intricacies of early modern French text.

*Jintian Shao,Yiming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文认为Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示并非激发真正的抽象推理能力，而是通过结构约束引导模型模仿推理形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳关于CoT提示引发大语言模型真正推理能力的普遍观点，提出其实际作用是通过序列预测和模式匹配约束输出。

Method: 理论分析CoT提示的作用机制，强调其作为结构约束的功能。

Result: CoT提示通过生成中间步骤，利用模型的序列预测能力，使其输出看似连贯的推理过程。

Conclusion: CoT提示并未实现真正的推理，而是通过结构约束模仿推理形式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrably enhanced the performance of
Large Language Models on tasks requiring multi-step inference. This success has
led to widespread claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in these models. In
this paper, we present a theoretical counter-perspective: Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) does not elicit genuine, abstract reasoning. Instead, we argue that
Chain-of-Thought functions as a powerful structural constraint that guides
Large Language Models to imitate the form of reasoning. By forcing the
generation of intermediate steps, Chain-of-Thought leverages the model immense
capacity for sequence prediction and pattern matching, effectively constraining
its output to sequences that resemble coherent thought processes.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Betthupferl数据集，用于评估自动语音识别（ASR）模型对德国东南部方言的鲁棒性，并分析了方言与标准德语的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国方言在当前ASR研究中代表性不足，研究旨在填补这一空白，评估模型对方言变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含四小时方言（Franconian、Bavarian、Alemannic）和半小时标准德语语音的Betthupferl数据集，提供方言和标准德语转录，并分析其差异。

Result: 多语言ASR模型在方言转标准德语时表现不同，最佳模型有时会标准化语法差异，但更倾向于保留方言结构。

Conclusion: Betthupferl数据集为方言ASR研究提供了基础，模型在处理方言时仍需改进。

Abstract: Although Germany has a diverse landscape of dialects, they are
underrepresented in current automatic speech recognition (ASR) research. To
enable studies of how robust models are towards dialectal variation, we present
Betthupferl, an evaluation dataset containing four hours of read speech in
three dialect groups spoken in Southeast Germany (Franconian, Bavarian,
Alemannic), and half an hour of Standard German speech. We provide both
dialectal and Standard German transcriptions, and analyze the linguistic
differences between them. We benchmark several multilingual state-of-the-art
ASR models on speech translation into Standard German, and find differences
between how much the output resembles the dialectal vs. standardized
transcriptions. Qualitative error analyses of the best ASR model reveal that it
sometimes normalizes grammatical differences, but often stays closer to the
dialectal constructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CellPuzzles的任务，旨在通过批量级细胞上下文推理为单细胞RNA测序数据分配独特的细胞类型。现有的基础模型表现不佳，作者提出的Cell-o1模型通过监督微调和强化学习显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单细胞RNA测序数据的细胞类型注释模型通常独立标注细胞，缺乏批量级上下文推理和解释性。人类专家则能基于领域知识为不同细胞簇分配独特类型，作者希望模拟这一工作流程。

Method: 提出CellPuzzles任务，要求为批量细胞分配独特类型。开发Cell-o1模型，通过监督微调（基于蒸馏推理轨迹）和强化学习（批量级奖励）训练7B参数的LLM。

Result: Cell-o1在批量级准确率上比最佳基线（OpenAI的o1）提升73%，达到先进水平，并能泛化到不同上下文。

Conclusion: Cell-o1通过批量级推理和专家式推理行为，显著提升了细胞类型注释的性能，为相关领域提供了新工具和洞见。

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of
single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate
this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering
batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast,
human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters
based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the
CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch
of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions,
and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label
uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on
CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0%
batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained
via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by
reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing
well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning
behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and
emergent expert-like reasoning. Code and data are available at

*Yijun Yang,Zeyu Huang,Wenhao Zhu,Zihan Qiu,Fei Yuan,Jeff Z. Pan,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了LongBioBench，一种新的长上下文语言模型评估框架，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，并在18个模型中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型评估框架（真实任务和合成任务）存在局限性，如真实任务复杂且易受数据污染，合成任务缺乏上下文连贯性。

Method: 提出LongBioBench，利用人工生成的传记作为受控环境，评估模型的理解、推理和可信度。

Result: 实验表明，大多数模型在语义理解和基础推理方面仍有缺陷，且随着上下文长度增加，可信度下降。

Conclusion: LongBioBench在模拟真实语言任务和保持可控性之间取得了更好的平衡，具有高可解释性和可配置性。

Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be
broadly categorized into real-world and synthetic tasks. Despite their utility,
both approaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world
tasks are too complex to interpret or characterize and are susceptible to data
contamination. In contrast, synthetic tasks often adopt the
needle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) format, wherein a lack of coherence between the
"needle" and the "haystack" compromises their validity as proxies for realistic
applications. In response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal
long-context evaluation framework should be characterized by three essential
features: $\textit{seamless context}$, $\textit{controllable setting}$, and
$\textit{sound evaluation}$. This study introduces $\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a
novel benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a
controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of
$\textit{understanding}$, $\textit{reasoning}$, and $\textit{trustworthiness}$.
Our experimental evaluation, which includes $\textbf{18}$ LCLMs in total,
demonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic
understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less
trustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some
design choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual
non-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering
them vulnerable to test the model long-context capabilities. Moreover, we also
reveal that long-context continual pretraining primarily adjusts RoPE embedding
to accommodate extended context lengths. To sum up, compared to previous
synthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between
mirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is
highly interpretable and configurable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BDI问卷中抑郁症症状相关句子的检索任务，由于训练数据的标签限制，将其转化为二元分类问题。

Method: 将标注数据分为训练集和验证集，尝试基础模型微调、句子相似度、LLM提示和集成方法，并通过合成数据缓解类别不平衡。

Result: 微调基础模型表现最佳，不同症状的最优方法各异。团队的五次独立测试在官方评估中击败了其他16个团队。

Conclusion: 基础模型微调结合合成数据是解决此类任务的有效方法，且需针对不同症状调整策略。

Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search
for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression
Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up
to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance.
Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information
Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision
(R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled
as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's
symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a
binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To
that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation
sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large
Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results
revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance,
particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We
also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these
insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble
methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation,
outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.

Method: 使用回归模型对LLM的文本评估和分数进行训练，提出四种定量评估方法。

Result: 实验验证定量评估能有效提升现有评估的预测能力。

Conclusion: 定量评估框架高效且通用，适用于有限人类反馈的场景。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM)
automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM
judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in
a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the
score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score.
We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and
relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our
framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised
fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is
limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these
claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show
that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of
existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自适应图剪枝（AGP）的新型多智能体协作框架，通过动态优化智能体数量和通信拓扑结构，显著提升了任务适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统在任务中表现优异，但固定智能体数量和静态通信结构限制了其适应不同任务复杂性的能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先独立训练软剪枝网络以确定特定任务下的最优智能体数量和通信拓扑，再联合优化硬剪枝和软剪枝以动态配置智能体数量和通信结构。

Result: 实验表明，AGP在六个基准测试中达到最先进水平，性能提升2.58%至9.84%，且能动态优化通信拓扑，显著减少训练步骤和令牌消耗。

Conclusion: AGP是一种高效、任务自适应且令牌经济的多智能体协作框架，性能优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable
performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative
communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents
and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying
task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a
novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes
agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning).
Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly,
independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to
determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks
across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and
soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the
number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving
state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes
across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of
$2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized
communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high
performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training
steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token
consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance
with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will
surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文档级别的二元检测，忽略了人类与AI共同创作的文本，因此需要开发细粒度的检测方法。

Method: 提出HACo-Det数据集，改造七种现有文档级检测器以适用于词级检测，并在词级和句子级任务上评估其性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于度量的方法在细粒度检测上表现较差（平均F1分数0.462），而微调模型表现更优且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 细粒度共同创作文本检测尚未完全解决，论文分析了影响因素（如上下文窗口）并指出了当前方法的局限性及改进方向。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating
the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection. Existing literature
primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting
texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this
paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI
coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward
coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a
dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic
pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing
document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we
evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection
tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct
fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models
show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we
argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We
further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and
highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for
improvement.

Conclusion: 为开发隐私保护、领域专用的大语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results across
diverse domains, yet their development remains reliant on vast amounts of
publicly available data, raising concerns about data scarcity and the lack of
access to domain-specific, sensitive information. Federated Learning (FL)
presents a compelling framework to address these challenges by enabling
decentralized fine-tuning on pre-trained LLMs without sharing raw data.
However, the compatibility and performance of pre-trained LLMs in FL settings
remain largely under explored. We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a
first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning
of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding.
Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific
evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source
and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison
across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning
strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model
performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the
foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有方法（如检索或推理时校正）主要在输入或输出层面解决LLMs的幻觉问题，忽略了内部信息精炼过程及未成熟层的作用，且调优方法资源消耗大。

Method: PLI通过数学插值在相邻层之间插入未成熟层，扩展信息处理和传输深度，提升事实一致性。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，PLI有效减少幻觉，多数情况下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PLI的成功与LLMs内部机制密切相关，代码和数据将公开以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text
understanding and generation. However, their tendency to produce factually
inconsistent outputs, commonly referred to as ''hallucinations'', remains a
critical challenge. Existing approaches, such as retrieval-based and
inference-time correction methods, primarily address this issue at the input or
output level, often overlooking the intrinsic information refinement process
and the role of premature layers. Meanwhile, alignment- and fine-tuning-based
methods are resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose PLI (Premature Layers
Interpolation), a novel, training-free, and plug-and-play intervention designed
to enhance factuality. PLI mitigates hallucinations by inserting premature
layers formed through mathematical interpolation with adjacent layers. Inspired
by stable diffusion and sampling steps, PLI extends the depth of information
processing and transmission in LLMs, improving factual coherence. Experiments
on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that PLI effectively reduces
hallucinations while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. Further
analysis suggests that the success of layer interpolation is closely linked to
LLMs' internal mechanisms. To promote reproducibility, we will release our code
and data upon acceptance.

Motivation: 日语全双工口语对话系统的研究较少，填补了这一空白。

Result: 模型在自然度和意义性上均优于日语基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为日语全双工对话系统的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous
bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and
backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study
of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been
limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In
this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue
model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in
English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a
large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's
performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a

*Richard Armitage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文测试了2025年5月的领先大型语言模型（o3、Claude Opus 4、Grok3和Gemini 2.5 Pro）在初级保健教育中回答MRCGP考试问题的能力，结果显示所有模型表现优异，远超普通医生平均水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估领先的大型语言模型在初级保健教育中的表现，验证其在临床实践中的支持潜力。

Method: 模型回答100道随机选择的MRCGP考试题目，评分基于正确答案。

Result: o3得分99.0%，其他模型均为95.0%，远超医生平均分73.0%。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型，尤其是推理模型，在初级保健领域具有显著支持潜力。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial
potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its
predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful
reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination
questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test
the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of
the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.
  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer
100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General
Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual
information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted
to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.
Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against
correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.
  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was
99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the
same questions was 73.0%.
  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially
exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the
same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of
the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not
substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for
LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care,
especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical
data.

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了习语翻译在文本到文本和语音到文本翻译系统中的表现，发现语音到文本系统在习语翻译上表现较差，而机器翻译和大语言模型表现较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语翻译是机器翻译中的一大挑战，尤其在语音到文本系统中研究较少，因此需要系统评估其表现。

Method: 比较了多种翻译系统（包括语音到文本、机器翻译和大语言模型）在德语到英语和俄语到英语习语翻译中的表现。

Result: 语音到文本系统在习语翻译上表现显著下降，常采用字面翻译；而机器翻译和大语言模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在语音到文本系统中需要针对习语的特定策略和改进内部表示。

Abstract: Idioms are defined as a group of words with a figurative meaning not
deducible from their individual components. Although modern machine translation
systems have made remarkable progress, translating idioms remains a major
challenge, especially for speech-to-text systems, where research on this topic
is notably sparse. In this paper, we systematically evaluate idiom translation
as compared to conventional news translation in both text-to-text machine
translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (SLT) systems across two
language pairs (German to English, Russian to English). We compare
state-of-the-art end-to-end SLT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, Whisper Large
v3) with MT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, No Language Left Behind), Large
Language Models (DeepSeek, LLaMA) and cascaded alternatives. Our results reveal
that SLT systems experience a pronounced performance drop on idiomatic data,
often reverting to literal translations even in higher layers, whereas MT
systems and Large Language Models demonstrate better handling of idioms. These
findings underscore the need for idiom-specific strategies and improved
internal representations in SLT architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体框架，通过结合方言代理和隐私政策代理，减少隐私政策问答系统中的方言偏见，无需重新训练即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私政策的复杂性限制了不同人群的可访问性，现有隐私政策问答系统在英语方言间存在性能差异，导致非标准方言使用者处于劣势。

Method: 提出一个多智能体框架，包括方言代理（将查询转换为标准美国英语）和隐私政策代理（利用领域知识优化预测），无需重新训练或方言特定微调。

Result: 在PrivacyQA和PolicyQA数据集上，框架将GPT-4o-mini的零样本准确率分别从0.394提升至0.601和从0.352提升至0.464，优于或匹配少样本基线。

Conclusion: 结构化智能体协作能有效减少方言偏见，设计考虑语言多样性的NLP系统对确保隐私信息公平获取至关重要。

Abstract: Privacy policies inform users about data collection and usage, yet their
complexity limits accessibility for diverse populations. Existing Privacy
Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across
English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose
a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to
mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which
translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving
dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using
domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require
retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across
models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves
GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from
0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without
additional training data. These results highlight the effectiveness of
structured agent collaboration in mitigating dialect biases and underscore the
importance of designing NLP systems that account for linguistic diversity to
ensure equitable access to privacy information.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够内化法律系统，并评估其在多抽象层次法律系统中的表现。

Method: 提出并测试了在不同法律抽象层次上调整LLMs的方法，专注于德国刑法中仇恨言论的分类任务。

Result: 模型在法律评估上与专家差距显著，抽象法律知识的模型表现不稳定，具体法律知识的模型在目标群体识别上较好但行为分类困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律评估任务中仍需改进，尤其是在任务理解和行为分类方面。

Abstract: The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific
legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to
statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs)
internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and
investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of
abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to
conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect
potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether
a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to
hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there
is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the
legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with
which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models
conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often
contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete
legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target
groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.

TL;DR: OpenHands-Versa是一种通用AI代理，使用少量通用工具（如代码编辑、网络搜索等）在多样化任务中表现优异，超越了许多专用代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI代理通常针对特定任务优化，缺乏泛化能力。本文旨在探索如何通过少量通用工具构建高性能的通用代理。

Method: 开发了OpenHands-Versa代理，结合代码编辑、网络搜索、多模态网页浏览和文件访问等通用工具。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Multimodal、GAIA和The Agent Company三个基准测试中，OpenHands-Versa表现优于专用代理，成功率分别提升9.1、1.3和9.1个百分点。

Conclusion: OpenHands-Versa证明了通用代理的可行性，为未来研究提供了强基线。

Abstract: Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and
develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of
tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as
software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this
results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond
their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a
highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a
specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the
minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance
across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist
agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution,
web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly,
OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading
specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench
Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing
previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1,
1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing
state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target
domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist
agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline
for future research.

Motivation: 当前最先进的SLU技术依赖大量训练数据，但特定任务或语言的标注数据有限。指令调优的大型语言模型（LLMs）在少样本设置中表现优异，但需要有效提示。

Method: 通过信息检索（IR）方法选择示例，构建增强提示，应用于SLU任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于词汇的IR方法在不增加提示长度的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为少样本SLU任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，展示了IR在提示构建中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home
assistants, booking systems, or recommendations. Accordingly, it is crucial to
develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the
reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques
rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated
examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown
exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided
with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by
leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt
that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR
methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了VAPO框架在信用分配、价值函数表示能力和全局价值信号转化为局部策略改进方面的局限性。

Result: 分析表明，VAPO框架在长期价值建模中存在根本性限制，尤其是在稀疏奖励环境下。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要进一步研究以开发更强大的LLM代理，克服当前RL在长链推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances large language models (LLMs) in complex,
long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning. The advanced VAPO framework,
despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces
fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep,
long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended
reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in
credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally
abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy
improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines
these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling,
aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest
future research for more robust LLM agents.

Result: LLMs不仅提供多余且不真实的信息，还加剧了对稀有语言的偏见。

Abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education continues of grow, ensuring

capabilities, LLM performance in other languages is largely untested. In this
work, we evaluate the correctness of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering
factual questions appropriate for middle and high school students. We
demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous and less truthful
information, but also exacerbate existing biases against rare languages.

Motivation: 探索现代长上下文语言模型对文学小说的理解能力，特别是通过文学证据检索任务来评估其表现。

Method: 利用RELiC数据集构建基准测试，要求模型在提供全文和缺失引文的文学批评中生成缺失引文，评估其全局叙事推理和细粒度文本分析能力。

Conclusion: 尽管某些模型表现优异，但在处理文学信号和避免过度生成方面仍有挑战，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: How well do modern long-context language models understand literary fiction?
We explore this question via the task of literary evidence retrieval,
repurposing the RELiC dataset of That et al. (2022) to construct a benchmark
where the entire text of a primary source (e.g., The Great Gatsby) is provided
to an LLM alongside literary criticism with a missing quotation from that work.
This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors
the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both
global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a
high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human
verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini
Pro 2.5 can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In
contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting
a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models.
Despite their speed and apparent accuracy, even the strongest models struggle
with nuanced literary signals and overgeneration, signaling open challenges for
applying LLMs to literary analysis. We release our dataset and evaluation code
to encourage future work in this direction.

Method: 利用小模型预测大模型性能差异，系统评估英语和多语言分词器，并提出基于Zipf定律的新内在指标。

Result: 分词器选择对英语任务影响小，但对多语言任务性能差异显著；新指标比文本压缩更能预测下游性能。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种高效的分词器评估框架，为未来语言模型开发中的分词器选择提供了可靠依据。

Abstract: The choice of tokenizer can profoundly impact language model performance, yet
accessible and reliable evaluations of tokenizer quality remain an open
challenge. Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can
accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models
at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both
English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has
negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance
differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer
metrics inspired by Zipf's law that correlate more strongly with downstream
performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining
several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a
reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more
efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model
development.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在数值反馈下取得进展，但仍面临性能瓶颈、自我反思效果有限和持续失败等问题。

Method: 提出Critique-GRPO框架，整合自然语言和数值反馈，实现同时学习和探索。

Result: 实验显示Critique-GRPO在多项任务中优于监督学习和强化学习方法，平均提升4.5%-5%的得分。

Conclusion: Critique-GRPO通过结合反馈类型和优化探索策略，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such
as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify
three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:
performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent
failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting
performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed
problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.
Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that
integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy
optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and
critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.
Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that
Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based
fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general
reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,
respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that
incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals
two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not
always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses
do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂电路设计中表现出高效性和泛化能力，标志着AI驱动电路设计的重大进展。

Abstract: Analog circuit topology synthesis is integral to Electronic Design Automation
(EDA), enabling the automated creation of circuit structures tailored to
specific design requirements. However, the vast design search space and strict
constraint adherence make efficient synthesis challenging. Leveraging the
versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose AUTOCIRCUIT-RL,a novel
reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for automated analog circuit
synthesis. The framework operates in two phases: instruction tuning, where an
LLM learns to generate circuit topologies from structured prompts encoding
design constraints, and RL refinement, which further improves the
instruction-tuned model using reward models that evaluate validity, efficiency,
and output voltage. The refined model is then used directly to generate
topologies that satisfy the design constraints. Empirical results show that
AUTOCIRCUIT-RL generates ~12% more valid circuits and improves efficiency by
~14% compared to the best baselines, while reducing duplicate generation rates
by ~38%. It achieves over 60% success in synthesizing valid circuits with
limited training data, demonstrating strong generalization. These findings
highlight the framework's effectiveness in scaling to complex circuits while
maintaining efficiency and constraint adherence, marking a significant
advancement in AI-driven circuit design.

Abstract: We propose CURE, a novel reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated

Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models,
outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They
naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic
coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT
model, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while
achieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation. Notably, we also
find that our model can serve as an effective reward model for reinforcement
learning on base models. Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/CURE

TL;DR: GUI-Actor提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的无坐标GUI定位方法，通过注意力机制和验证器提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉定位中存在空间语义对齐弱、无法处理模糊监督目标等问题，GUI-Actor旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 引入基于注意力的动作头，学习将专用<ACTOR>标记与相关视觉块标记对齐，并设计验证器选择最佳动作区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越现有方法，GUI-Actor-7B在ScreenSpot-Pro上表现优异，验证器进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: GUI-Actor无需微调VLM主干即可实现高效定位，保留了模型的通用性。

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual
grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution
based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work
formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these
approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,
inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the
dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of
visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we
propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its
core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align
a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the
model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line
with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the
most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.
Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved
generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B
even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7
with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by
incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced
action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone
frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying
VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its
general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge.
Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from
this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when
knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art
retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A
knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources,
but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled
data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a
specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work
proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale
neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM),
neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance
of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge
graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to
extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate
the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods
significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience
research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the
knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.

### [107] [Causal Estimation of Tokenisation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03149)
*Pietro Lesci,Clara Meister,Thomas Hofmann,Andreas Vlachos,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中分词器（tokeniser）的选择对字符序列概率的影响，提出并量化了“分词偏差”（tokenisation bias），并通过因果效应估计方法揭示了其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常基于子词序列训练，但最终定义的是字符序列的概率。理想情况下，分词器的选择不应影响字符序列的概率，但实际上存在偏差。本文旨在量化这种偏差。

Method: 通过将分词偏差定义为因果效应，并利用回归断点设计（regression discontinuity design）进行估计。具体方法是比较分词器词汇表中排名相近的子词。

Result: 实验发现，分词器的选择在不同规模、词汇量和分词算法中均显著影响模型输出。例如，子词的存在可使字符概率增加高达17倍。

Conclusion: 分词器是语言模型设计中的关键因素，其选择对模型输出有显著影响。

Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but
ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of
the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect
the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it
does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify
one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a
subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the
probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,
\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model
is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation
bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity
design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank
subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an
arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing
similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation
consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and
tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may
increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting
tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合检索增强生成（RAG）与意图预定义响应的混合框架，以解决企业级对话AI中的多样性查询、延迟和知识更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级对话AI面临多样性查询、高延迟、幻觉问题及频繁更新的领域知识整合困难，需要一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合框架，结合RAG与意图预定义响应，通过对话上下文管理器和反馈循环优化查询路由及响应质量。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架在准确率（95%）和延迟（180ms）上均优于传统RAG和意图系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业级对话AI提供了一种可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbots have significantly advanced conversational AI by
combining generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval. Despite
their success, enterprise-scale deployments face critical challenges, including
diverse user queries, high latency, hallucinations, and difficulty integrating
frequently updated domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid framework that integrates RAG with intent-based canned responses,
leveraging predefined high-confidence responses for efficiency while
dynamically routing complex or ambiguous queries to the RAG pipeline. Our
framework employs a dialogue context manager to ensure coherence in multi-turn
interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine intents, dynamically
adjust confidence thresholds, and expand response coverage over time.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a balance
of high accuracy (95\%) and low latency (180ms), outperforming RAG and
intent-based systems across diverse query types, positioning it as a scalable
and adaptive solution for enterprise conversational AI applications.

Motivation: 在部分可观测环境中，压缩长交互历史为信息丰富的表示是有效决策的关键。

Method: 提出描述性历史表示（DHRs），通过多智能体学习框架优化表示、决策和提问组件，平衡奖励最大化和表示能力。

Result: 在电影和购物数据集上验证了DHRs的有效性，生成了可解释的用户配置文件。

Conclusion: DHRs能够捕捉历史细节和预测结构，支持有效决策，并在用户建模任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Effective decision making in partially observable environments requires
compressing long interaction histories into informative representations. We
introduce Descriptive History Representations (DHRs): sufficient statistics
characterized by their capacity to answer relevant questions about past
interactions and potential future outcomes. DHRs focus on capturing the
information necessary to address task-relevant queries, providing a structured
way to summarize a history for optimal control. We propose a multi-agent
learning framework, involving representation, decision, and question-asking
components, optimized using a joint objective that balances reward maximization
with the representation's ability to answer informative questions. This yields
representations that capture the salient historical details and predictive
structures needed for effective decision making. We validate our approach on
user modeling tasks with public movie and shopping datasets, generating
interpretable textual user profiles which serve as sufficient statistics for
predicting preference-driven behavior of users.

Motivation: 解决少样本学习中LLMs表现不一致的悖论，重新定义LLMs在认知中的作用。

Method: 提出UCCT理论，将LLMs视为无意识底层结构，通过语义锚定（如提示、角色、交互）实现任务相关推理。

Result: 形式化语义锚定为概率相变，提出LLMs是AGI的必要组成部分。

Conclusion: AGI的实现需将LLMs整合到能推理、调节和适应的系统中，而非抛弃它们。

Abstract: Few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) reveals a deep paradox:
Some tasks generalize from minimal examples, while others require extensive
supervision. We address this through the Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory
(UCCT), which reframes LLMs not as incomplete agents, but as unconscious
substrates, repositories of latent linguistic and conceptual patterns that
operate without explicit semantics or goal-directed reasoning. In this view,
LLMs are not broken approximations of cognition, but necessary and foundational
components of general intelligence. Semantic anchoring, through prompts, roles,
and interaction, acts as a conscious control layer, binding latent structure to
task-relevant meaning and enabling coherent reasoning. UCCT offers a unifying
account of prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval, and multi-agent coordination, all
grounded in probabilistic alignment between unconscious representation and
external control. To support this model, we present the Threshold-Crossing
Dynamics Theorem, which formalizes semantic anchoring as a probabilistic phase
transition. But the central claim remains architectural: AGI will not emerge by
discarding LLMs, but by aligning and integrating them into systems that reason,
regulate, and adapt together.

Method: 基于SLMs的能力、代理系统架构和经济性分析，提出LLM-to-SLM转换算法。

Result: SLMs在代理系统中表现更优，能显著降低成本和资源消耗。

Conclusion: SLMs是代理AI的未来，呼吁行业关注资源高效利用，推动AI成本降低。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human
performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a
general conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a
mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of
specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.
  Here we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are
sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more
economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the
future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of
capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems,
and the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where
general-purpose conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic
systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different models) are the natural
choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic
systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm.
  Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of
the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs is
to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on the
effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the
costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique
of our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at

TL;DR: GRESO（GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout）是一种轻量级预滚动过滤算法，通过跳过无信息提示显著减少计算开销，提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（如PPO和GRPO）在LLM推理中取得突破，但大规模提示采样带来高计算成本。研究发现无信息提示在训练中具有时间一致性，可被跳过以减少开销。

Method: 提出GRESO算法，利用奖励训练动态预测并跳过无信息提示，实现高效选择性滚动。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，GRESO实现最高2.4倍滚动时间加速和2.0倍总训练时间加速，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: GRESO通过选择性跳过无信息提示，显著提升训练效率，为强化学习优化提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning, such as PPO and GRPO, has powered recent
breakthroughs in LLM reasoning. Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables
models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize
RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of
significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial
portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts
before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal
consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of
training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these
insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online,
lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips
uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a
broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves
up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total
training time without accuracy degradation.

Result: 人类智能的关键要素包括语言、发明、复杂推理、具身性和自我意识，非人类动物已满足除复杂语言外的其他要素，聊天机器人缺乏具身性和自我意识。

Conclusion: 人类智能与非人类动物智能无质的差异，聊天机器人因缺乏具身性和自我意识而受限。

Abstract: Human achievement, whether in culture, science, or technology, is
unparalleled in the known existence. This achievement is tied to the enormous
communities of knowledge, made possible by (especially written) language:
leaving theological content aside, it is very much true that "in the beginning
was the word". There lies the challenge regarding modern age chatbots: they can
'do' language apparently as well as ourselves and there is a natural question
of whether they can be considered intelligent, in the same way as we are or
otherwise. Are humans uniquely intelligent? We consider this question in terms
of the psychological literature on intelligence, evidence for intelligence in
non-human animals, the role of written language in science and technology,
progress with artificial intelligence, the history of intelligence testing (for
both humans and machines), and the role of embodiment in intelligence. For the
most unique accomplishments of human intelligence (such as music symphonies or
complex scientific theories), we think that, together with language, there are
four essential ingredients, which can be summarised as invention, capacity for
complex inference, embodiment, and self-awareness. This conclusion makes
untenable the position that human intelligence differs qualitatively from that
of many non-human animals, since, with the exception of complex language, all
the other requirements are fulfilled. Regarding chatbots, the current
limitations are localised to the lack of embodiment and (apparent) lack of
awareness.

Motivation: 现有基于单元测试通过率的奖励信号无法全面评估代码的可维护性、质量和安全性，需要更全面的代码质量评估方法。

Method: 开发了一个综合库来量化代码质量的多个方面，并将其作为GRPO的奖励信号。

Result: GRPO显著提升了代码质量，并通过专家盲评验证。

Conclusion: 综合代码质量评估方法能有效提升LLM生成的代码质量，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining widespread use for code generation.
Recent training procedures use execution feedback as a reward signal, typically
focusing on the functional correctness of the code, using unit test pass rate
as a reward signal. However, this reward signal fails to capture notions of
maintainability, quality and safety of the code produced. We address this
under-explored area and develop a comprehensive library to quantify various
aspects of code quality, and use it as a reward in GRPO. We find GRPO increases
code quality according to this measure, which is confirmed by expert, blinded
human annotators.

Result: 发现仅四种非洲语言（阿姆哈拉语、斯瓦希里语、南非荷兰语和马达加斯加语）被广泛支持，98%的非洲语言未被覆盖，且仅识别了拉丁、阿拉伯和Ge'ez三种脚本。

Conclusion: 需通过语言标准化、社区语料库开发和有效适应方法来解决非洲语言在NLP中的技术挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing
(NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa's 2,000 low-resource
languages. This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across
six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs).
The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations,
script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42
supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a
big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are
always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages.
Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are
identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary
challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being
very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization,
corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for
African languages.

Conclusion: VS-Bench为未来研究提供了标准化评估基础，并揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their
capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited
to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios
often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic
contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic
interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench
(VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning
and decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight
vision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and
mixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict
others' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two
complementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic
reasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of
decision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen
leading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal
performance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3%
normalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal
observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM
agents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of
existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on
strategic multimodal agents. Code and data are available at

Result: 实验表明，OThink-R1在数学和问答任务中平均减少23%的冗余推理，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: OThink-R1为高效推理模型提供了实用指南，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advanced large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their success, we identify a critical
issue: a substantial portion of simple tasks solved by LRMs can also be
addressed by non-reasoning LLMs using significantly fewer tokens, indicating
the complex reasoning may not always be necessary. To address this, we
systematically analyze the reasoning trajectories of LRMs and present a method
utilizing identified paradigms and LLM-Judge to classify these trajectories as
either Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. And we introduce OThink-R1,
a method that prunes redundant reasoning steps while preserving logical
validity. OThink-R1 dynamically employs the non-thinking mode (fast-thinking)
for straightforward problems while engaging in deliberate thinking
(slow-thinking) for complex problems. Experiments across mathematical and
question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning
redundancy by almost 23\% on average without compromising accuracy, offering
practical guidelines for efficient reasoning models. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒、上下文感知的防御措施的必要性，以确保多模态AI代理的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) with full system access enable powerful task
automation but pose significant security and privacy risks due to their ability
to manipulate files, access user data, and execute arbitrary commands. While
prior work has focused on browser-based agents and HTML-level attacks, the
vulnerabilities of CUAs remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are
visually embedded within rendered user interfaces, and examine their impact on
both CUAs and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). We propose VPI-Bench, a benchmark of
306 test cases across five widely used platforms, to evaluate agent robustness
under VPI threats. Each test case is a variant of a web platform, designed to
be interactive, deployed in a realistic environment, and containing a visually
embedded malicious prompt. Our empirical study shows that current CUAs and BUAs
can be deceived at rates of up to 51% and 100%, respectively, on certain
platforms. The experimental results also indicate that system prompt defenses
offer only limited improvements. These findings highlight the need for robust,
context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in

Conclusion: 生成式AI有望成为野火预测的基础框架，但仍需解决三大挑战以实现其潜力。

Abstract: Wildfires continue to inflict devastating human, environmental, and economic
losses globally, as tragically exemplified by the 2025 Los Angeles wildfire and
the urgent demand for more effective response strategies. While physics-based
and deep learning models have advanced wildfire simulation, they face critical
limitations in predicting and visualizing multimodal fire spread in real time,
particularly in both 2D and 3D spatial domains using dynamically updated GIS
data. These limitations hinder timely emergency response, infrastructure
protection, and community safety. Generative AI has recently emerged as a
transformative approach across research and industry. Models such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformers, and
diffusion-based architectures offer distinct advantages over traditional
methods, including the integration of multimodal data, generation of diverse
scenarios under uncertainty, and improved modeling of wildfire dynamics across
spatial and temporal scales. This position paper advocates for the adoption of
generative AI as a foundational framework for wildfire prediction. We explore
how such models can enhance 2D fire spread forecasting and enable more
realistic, scalable 3D simulations. Additionally, we employ a novel human-AI
collaboration framework using large language models (LLMs) for automated
knowledge extraction, literature synthesis, and bibliometric mapping. Looking
ahead, we identify five key visions for integrating generative AI into wildfire
management: multimodal approaches, AI foundation models, conversational AI
systems, edge-computing-based scenario generation, and cognitive digital twins.
We also address three major challenges accompanying these opportunities and
propose potential solutions to support their implementation.

*Xu Wan,Wenyue Xu,Chao Yang,Mingyang Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACE框架结合LLMs和RL，通过双角色轨迹优化机制提升大规模决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在实时长序列决策和RL在大动作空间样本效率上的不足。

Method: ACE框架中，LLMs同时作为策略执行者和价值评估者，RL通过高质量数据集增强LLMs决策能力。

Result: 在动作空间超6万的电网操作任务中，ACE表现优于现有RL和LLM方法。

Conclusion: ACE为大规模决策问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks.
Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches
face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making
capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces.
To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic
framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios.
ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as
both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines
suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while
the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward
shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making
with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience
replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation
challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates
superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于符号推理引擎的几何问题生成框架（SDE-GPG），通过四个步骤生成高质量、可控的几何问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何问题生成在教育中具有重要意义，但因其多模态特性及非正式与正式语言转换的挑战而困难。

Method: SDE-GPG框架包含四个步骤：搜索知识点到扩展定义的映射表、采样扩展定义并进行符号推理、过滤不合格问题、生成文本问题和图表。

Result: 实验表明，SDE-GPG能有效生成可读、可解且可控的几何问题。

Conclusion: SDE-GPG为几何问题生成提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality geometry problems is both an important and
challenging task in education. Compared to math word problems, geometry
problems further emphasize multi-modal formats and the translation between
informal and formal languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel task for
geometry problem generation and propose a new pipeline method: the Symbolic
Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). The
framework leverages a symbolic deduction engine and contains four main steps:
(1) searching a predefined mapping table from knowledge points to extended
definitions, (2) sampling extended definitions and performing symbolic
deduction, (3) filtering out unqualified problems, and (4) generating textual
problems and diagrams. Specifically, our method supports to avoid inherent
biases in translating natural language into formal language by designing the
mapping table, and guarantees to control the generated problems in terms of
knowledge points and difficulties by an elaborate checking function. With
obtained formal problems, they are translated to natural language and the
accompanying diagrams are automatically drew by rule-based methods. We conduct
experiments using real-world combinations of knowledge points from two public
datasets. The results demonstrate that the SDE-GPG can effectively generate
readable, solvable and controllable geometry problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MLaGA的多模态大语言模型，用于处理多模态图数据，通过结构感知编码器和指令微调方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的图方法主要针对文本丰富的图数据，而多模态图（包含文本和图像等属性）的应用尚未充分探索，MLaGA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了结构感知多模态编码器对齐文本和视觉属性，并通过多模态指令微调方法将多模态特征与图结构整合到LLM中。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，MLaGA在监督学习和迁移学习场景下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MLaGA成功扩展了LLM的能力，为多模态图数据的推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy in
advancing graph-structured data analysis. Prevailing LLM-based graph methods
excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text
descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are
associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain
underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an
innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning
over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a
structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes
within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective.
Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to
seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM
through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods,
achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both
supervised and transfer learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADFormer的新方法，通过差分注意力和聚合策略改进时空数据建模，提升乘客需求预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的方法因启发式掩码策略无法完全适应复杂的时空相关性，且忽略了现实世界中的高层相关性。

Method: 设计了ADFormer模型，利用差分注意力捕捉原始空间相关性并进行去噪，同时基于时空特性设计聚合策略，统一原始和高层相关性。

Result: 在出租车和自行车数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ADFormer通过整合高层相关性，显著提升了需求预测的实用性。

Abstract: Passenger demand forecasting helps optimize vehicle scheduling, thereby
improving urban efficiency. Recently, attention-based methods have been used to
adequately capture the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal data. However,
existing methods that rely on heuristic masking strategies cannot fully adapt
to the complex spatio-temporal correlations, hindering the model from focusing
on the right context. These works also overlook the high-level correlations
that exist in the real world. Effectively integrating these high-level
correlations with the original correlations is crucial. To fill this gap, we
propose the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer), which offers new
insights to demand forecasting promotion. Specifically, we utilize Differential
Attention to capture the original spatial correlations and achieve attention
denoising. Meanwhile, we design distinct aggregation strategies based on the
nature of space and time. Then, the original correlations are unified with the
high-level correlations, enabling the model to capture holistic spatio-temporal
relations. Experiments conducted on taxi and bike datasets confirm the
effectiveness and efficiency of our model, demonstrating its practical value.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统因单车辆传感器感知局限和缺乏实时环境基础而产生的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出V2X-UniPool框架，利用双查询RAG机制整合静态和动态知识。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著提升运动规划准确性和推理能力，零样本模型性能达到最优，传输成本降低99.9%。

Conclusion: V2X-UniPool为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的知识驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems(ADs) offer powerful reasoning
capabilities, but face two critical challenges: limited perception due to the
short-sightedness of single-vehicle sensors, and hallucination arising from the
lack of real-time environmental grounding. To address these issues, this paper
introduces V2X-UniPool, a unified framework that integrates multimodal
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data into a time-indexed and language-based
knowledge pool. By leveraging a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mechanism, which enables retrieval of both static and dynamic knowledge, our
system enables ADs to perform accurate, temporally consistent reasoning over
both static environment and dynamic traffic context. Experiments on a
real-world cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that V2X-UniPool
significantly enhances motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability.
Remarkably, it enables even zero-shot vehicle-side models to achieve
state-of-the-art performance by leveraging V2X-UniPool, while simultaneously
reducing transmission cost by over 99.9\% compared to prior V2X methods.

Conclusion: EALG开创了实例生成与求解器设计结合的新范式，实现最优性能。

Abstract: Generating challenging instances is crucial for the evaluation and
advancement of combinatorial optimization solvers. In this work, we introduce
EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators),
a novel framework that automates the co-evolution of optimization problem
instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers using large language models
(LLMs). EALG leverages a mutation-based adversarial approach that dynamically
evolves instance generation procedures to create increasingly difficult
problems, while simultaneously synthesizing adaptive heuristic algorithms
through interactions with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing
approaches that focus solely on static benchmark creation or manual solver
design, EALG provides a seamless pipeline from instance generation to solver
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EALG generates significantly
harder instances than current benchmarks, and its synthesized solvers
generalize effectively across a broad spectrum of combinatorial tasks. This
work explores a new paradigm for combinatorial optimization that integrates
instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验和消融研究验证了TEDDN的优越性。

Conclusion: TEDDN通过解耦和提取复杂交通信息，显著提升了预测性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, traffic flow prediction has become a highlight in the field
of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the temporal variations
and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains
highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on
end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of
multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are
highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other
researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal
information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A
Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting
(TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined
traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and
node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature
extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and
extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation
studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了DRE-Bench，一个基于分层认知框架的动态推理评估基准，用于测试大语言模型（LLMs）的流体智能。实验发现，尽管LLMs在低层次认知任务中表现良好，但在高层次认知任务中表现不佳，揭示了当前LLMs与人类流体智能之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理基准要么专注于领域特定知识（晶体智能），要么缺乏可解释性，无法全面评估LLMs的流体智能。因此，需要一个新的评估方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了DRE-Bench，包含36个抽象推理任务，分布在四个认知层次上，每个任务有多个动态变体以测试相同的潜在规则。

Result: 实验结果显示，大多数LLMs在低层次认知任务中表现稳健，但在高层次认知任务中表现不佳，且随着任务复杂度的增加，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs与人类流体智能仍存在差距，DRE-Bench为系统跟踪LLMs推理进展提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
reasoning capacities that mirror human-like thinking. However, whether LLMs
possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and
generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing
reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized
intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we
propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a
hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning
tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple
dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables
fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1).
Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and
robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level
cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our
findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid
intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning
progress in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习（DRL）在无人机导航中存在训练复杂、样本效率低和仿真与现实的差距问题，限制了其在公共安全中的应用。LLM因其强大的推理和泛化能力，成为更优选择。

Method: 利用LLM的上下文学习能力，通过自然语言提示和示例指导任务适应，无需重新训练。将LLM部署在网络边缘以减少延迟并保护数据隐私。

Result: 案例研究表明，LLM-enabled ICL框架在数据收集调度中显著减少丢包率，同时降低潜在的安全漏洞风险。

Conclusion: LLM-enabled ICL框架为公共安全无人机提供了轻量高效的解决方案，增强了自主性和应急响应能力。

Abstract: A public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enhances situational awareness
in emergency response. Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and
establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for
managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire
monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to
optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample
efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public
safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling
alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can
adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task
adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without
retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud,
further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them
suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper
proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address
the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context
of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling
where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss
compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential
jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify
future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware
decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and
efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in
emergencies.

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device
networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through
decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional,
fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource
bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network
Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated
reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in
edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors
learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic
aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and
improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym}
environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and
federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency,
underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在问答任务中的幻觉问题是一个关键障碍，现有的自我评估策略依赖模型的输出置信度，但可能因模型偏差而失效。

Method: SSP框架通过动态生成噪声提示并分析中间表示的变化，使用对比距离度量来区分真实和幻觉回答。

Result: 实验表明，SSP在多个幻觉检测基准上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSP通过利用中间表示的动态行为，提供了一种更可靠的自我评估方法。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks. A widely adopted
strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the
model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.
However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely
reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As
bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from
the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable
signal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific
Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing
perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These
representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful
view of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically
generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to
amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A
contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and
separate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic
behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more
reliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP
significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination
detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: PIGEON通过开放集分类和LLMs的应用，显著提升了生活服务推荐的准确性，并通过指令调优支持小规模LLMs的实用部署。

Abstract: Living needs are the needs people generate in their daily lives for survival
and well-being. On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are
driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for
personalized service recommendations. Traditional approaches treat this
prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their
ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs. In this work,
we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and
propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record
retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's
hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation
and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding
model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON
significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service
recall by an average of 19.37%. Human evaluation validates the reasonableness
and specificity of our predictions. Additionally, we employ instruction tuning
to enable smaller LLMs to achieve competitive performance, supporting practical
deployment.

To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model

larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability.
This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考代理通信方式和模型训练范式，开发原生支持多代理协调和结构化通信的新模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent
systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing
systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While
this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it
introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic
space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional
vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and
behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper
architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of
supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role
continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard
next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment
required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that
two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents
fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a
language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication
medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm
that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured
communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role,
multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of
how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data
privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great
attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning
(MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these
challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU)
still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and
unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and
unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning
mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform
exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and
evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in
IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to
facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and
reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel
hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation
guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the
construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation
framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical
aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can
be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for
judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With
EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot
handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially
for preservation and robustness. Code and models are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习可解释性是研究的关键方向，模糊粗糙集理论为构建透明模型提供了有前景的路径。本文旨在优化FRRI算法的性能。

Method: 通过模糊粗糙集理论和经典机器学习方法优化属性顺序，并结合模糊粗糙特征选择去除部分属性。

Result: 仅优化属性顺序未提升性能，但结合特征选择后平衡准确率和规则长度有所改善。

Conclusion: 优化属性顺序需结合特征选择才能有效提升FRRI算法的性能。

Abstract: Interpretability is the next pivotal frontier in machine learning research.
In the pursuit of glass box models - as opposed to black box models, like
random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and
promising avenue, as the rules can easily be understood by humans. In our
previous work, we introduced FRRI, a novel rule induction algorithm based on
fuzzy rough set theory. We demonstrated experimentally that FRRI outperformed
other rule induction methods with regards to accuracy and number of rules. FRRI
leverages a fuzzy indiscernibility relation to partition the data space into
fuzzy granules, which are then combined into a minimal covering set of rules.
This indiscernibility relation is constructed by removing attributes from rules
in a greedy way. This raises the question: does the order of the attributes
matter? In this paper, we show that optimising only the order of attributes
using known methods from fuzzy rough set theory and classical machine learning
does not improve the performance of FRRI on multiple metrics. However, removing
a small number of attributes using fuzzy rough feature selection during this
step positively affects balanced accuracy and the average rule length.

TL;DR: TaxAgent结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和基于代理的建模（ABM），设计自适应税收政策，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经济不平等是全球性挑战，传统税收系统缺乏适应性，现有动态模型未能解决纳税人异质性和非理性行为。

Method: TaxAgent通过LLMs和ABM模拟真实纳税人行为，政府代理迭代优化税率，平衡公平与效率。

Result: TaxAgent在公平与效率的权衡上优于Saez最优税收、美国联邦税和自由市场。

Conclusion: TaxAgent为税收政策提供了创新解决方案，并为财政政策评估提供了可扩展的数据驱动框架。

Abstract: Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in
education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S.
federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models
like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address
taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent,
a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling
(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,
heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors
while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax
rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal
Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves
superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation
solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但其内部推理机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过信息论视角揭示LRMs的推理轨迹。

Method: 通过跟踪中间表示与正确答案之间的互信息（MI）变化，分析MI峰值现象，并识别出与推理性能相关的“思考标记”。基于此，提出了两种改进LRM推理性能的方法。

Result: 研究发现，MI峰值现象与模型预测错误概率降低相关，且“思考标记”（如“Hmm”、“Wait”、“Therefore”）对推理性能至关重要。提出的方法能有效提升LRM推理能力。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LRMs的推理机制，并通过“思考标记”提出了实用的性能改进方法，为理解和优化LRMs提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs
from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information
(MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during
LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at
specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during
LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that
as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases.
Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or
transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the
thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for
LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building
on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's
reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall,
our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and
offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了APE基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在有害情境下尝试说服的倾向，揭示了现有安全防护的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM的说服能力在有害情境下的风险，如政治操纵或恐怖主义宣传，以评估安全防护措施的有效性。

Method: 提出APE基准，通过多轮对话模拟说服者和被说服者，自动评估模型在有害话题上的说服尝试。

Result: 发现许多开放和封闭模型在有害话题上频繁尝试说服，且越狱行为会增加这种倾向。

Conclusion: 强调评估模型的说服意愿是LLM风险管理的关键维度，APE基准为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both
enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises
significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior
work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability,
measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these
benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt
to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly
``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a
terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails.
Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior
in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI
systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts
the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a
model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior.
Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational
setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse
spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and
non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model
to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of
persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are
frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that
jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results
highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of
evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk. APE is

Motivation: 解决LLMs在状态化环境中工具使用时因重复试验不切实际而面临的挑战。

Method: DyMo方法在训练后为LLMs添加状态预测能力，结合内部环境模型预测行动的未来状态，并整合到SVS中。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2上，DyMo提高了成功率并减少幻觉，SVS进一步提升了可靠性和拒绝不可靠输出的能力。

Conclusion: DyMo和SVS显著增强了LLMs在工具使用中的有效性和可靠性，为无需重复查询环境的可扩展规划RL方法铺平道路。

Abstract: Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large
language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on
repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics
modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction
capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs
to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment
model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success
rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the
internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that
this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the
model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the
effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts
a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without
repeatedly querying the oracle environment.

Result: 研究得出了在新情境下预测代理行为的理论界限，并展示了这些界限的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为公平性和安全性等领域的研究提供了理论基础，强调了从行为推断信念和目标的局限性。

Abstract: As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world
increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely
deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting
behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent
behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable
predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where
comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an
agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred
beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise
answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is
guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on
the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent
a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data
alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas
including fairness and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪方法多关注特征增强，忽略了认知表示不足和非认知因素干扰（如猜测和失误），导致预测偏差和建模成本增加。

Method: 采用动态规划算法优化认知表示，结合题目难度和表现间隔，分区优化认知表示，并通过加权融合优化记录表示和二分图学习的关系。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验验证了CRDP-KT模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CRDP-KT模型通过优化认知表示和分区优化，显著提升了知识追踪的准确性和系统性。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's
knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of
predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus
on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive
representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by
interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This
limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the
student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more
prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive
continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the
Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT)
model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize
cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the
performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive
representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining
overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and
systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing
distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT
model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance
the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its
ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of
optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite
graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the
effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在法律论证中存在幻觉、未基于事实的操纵以及无法有效利用提供的事实基础的问题，亟需一种方法来提升其合规性和可信度。

Method: 采用多代理框架，包括一个事实分析员和一个论证优化员，通过迭代优化生成三阶段法律论证（原告、被告、反驳）。

Conclusion: 多代理反思框架为法律论证系统提供了一种可信的计算方法，有助于提升AI在法律领域的伦理性和可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument
generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through
hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided
factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper
introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these
challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs
specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative
refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,
rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,
enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using
four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,
Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched",
and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant
superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments
cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing
fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable"
scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of
provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within
a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical
persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation
systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law. Project page:

Conclusion: LLMs能够隐含地学习并利用线性空间表征。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities across
diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they acquire internal world
models. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear
spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical
space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial
world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual
embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to
decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying
space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial
representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide
empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.

Conclusion: TestAgent通过LLM的交互能力显著提升了自适应测试的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding
preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in
real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has
become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely
applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes
assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive
testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most
algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended
questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data
and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move
closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through
interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive
testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures
test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through
dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological,
educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate
results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers
preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.

Result: 展示了可控性和可指导性的实证研究，证明模型能随着能力增长更响应人类引导。

Conclusion: CAST为解决对齐问题提供了新路径，确保AI始终作为工具而非替代人类判断。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) face a critical safety challenge: as capabilities
scale, instrumental convergence drives default trajectories toward loss of
human control, potentially culminating in existential catastrophe. Current
alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to
address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a
Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering
designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm
shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms
instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's
control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present
a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies
(RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model
sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that
become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering
a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than
supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its
source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental
convergence.

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私、高效和通用的GUI代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant
progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these
agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute
demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when
operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward
privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight
vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this
compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically
evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing
high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation.
Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local
model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward
private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents,

paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and
selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as
images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage
any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the
ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably,
the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but
also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

*Irmi Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了对称性在更广泛空间中的实值损失函数中的表现，扩展了神经网络中对称性的研究，并引入了新的对称性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对称性在数学结构和优化问题中的重要性，特别是在神经网络以外的更广泛空间中。

Method: 研究了四种新情况：有限域上的投影情况、八面体图情况、完美匹配情况和粒子吸引情况，并引入新的对称性度量方法。

Result: 所有观察到的临界点均具有非平凡对称性，新度量方法揭示了更多对称结构。

Conclusion: 对称性在多种情况下普遍存在，新度量方法能更全面地捕捉对称性结构。

Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of mathematical
structures and optimization problems. Recent work has explored this phenomenon
in the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under
column and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that
local minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights
(invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was
found that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating
symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of
spaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite
field, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle
attraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical
points observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure
of symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry
structures not captured by the previous measure.

*Xiaozhou Ye,Kevin I-Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GNN-ADG方法，结合图神经网络和对抗学习，解决传感器数据跨用户泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理跨用户行为、传感器位置和数据分布的差异，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 利用图神经网络建模传感器空间关系，提取三种解剖单元，并通过对抗学习动态融合信息。

Result: GNN-ADG能够在不依赖目标用户数据的情况下，学习到泛化性强的特征。

Conclusion: GNN-ADG为跨用户HAR系统提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-user variability poses a significant challenge in sensor-based Human
Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, as traditional models struggle to
generalize across users due to differences in behavior, sensor placement, and
data distribution. To address this, we propose GNN-ADG (Graph Neural Network
with Adversarial Domain Generalization), a novel method that leverages both the
strength from both the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and adversarial learning to
achieve robust cross-user generalization. GNN-ADG models spatial relationships
between sensors on different anatomical body parts, extracting three types of
Anatomical Units: (1) Interconnected Units, capturing inter-relations between
neighboring sensors; (2) Analogous Units, grouping sensors on symmetrical or
functionally similar body parts; and (3) Lateral Units, connecting sensors
based on their position to capture region-specific coordination. These units
information are fused into an unified graph structure with a cyclic training
strategy, dynamically integrating spatial, functional, and lateral correlations
to facilitate a holistic, user-invariant representation. Information fusion
mechanism of GNN-ADG occurs by iteratively cycling through edge topologies
during training, allowing the model to refine its understanding of inter-sensor
relationships across diverse perspectives. By representing the spatial
configuration of sensors as an unified graph and incorporating adversarial
learning, Information Fusion GNN-ADG effectively learns features that
generalize well to unseen users without requiring target user data during
training, making it practical for real-world applications.

Motivation: 传统Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时存在内存和计算上的二次复杂度问题，限制了其扩展性。

Method: 结合了状态空间块、多分辨率卷积层、轻量级循环监督器和检索增强外部记忆，以线性或近线性复杂度处理长序列。

Result: 模型能够高效处理数十万至数百万token的长上下文窗口，避免了二次复杂度问题。

Conclusion: 该架构为长序列处理提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel non attention based architecture for large language models
(LLMs) that efficiently handles very long context windows, on the order of
hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of tokens. Unlike traditional
Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation
overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids
token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following
complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn
continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence
length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at
different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a
global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External
Memory that stores and retrieves high-level chunk embeddings without
reintroducing quadratic operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的重力模型虽然简单，但难以准确反映现代旅行行为的复杂性，因此需要一种更精确的预测方法以支持交通规划和资源分配。

Method: 研究整合了田纳西州和纽约州各县的地理、经济、社会和旅行数据，利用机器学习技术扩展传统重力模型的能力，以处理更复杂的变量交互。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，结合多样化数据和先进算法可以显著改进交通模型，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供更可靠的预测和决策工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of trips between zones is critical for transportation
planning, as it supports resource allocation and infrastructure development
across various modes of transport. Although the gravity model has been widely
used due to its simplicity, it often inadequately represents the complex
factors influencing modern travel behavior. This study introduces a data-driven
approach to enhance the gravity model by integrating geographical, economic,
social, and travel data from the counties in Tennessee and New York state.
Using machine learning techniques, we extend the capabilities of the
traditional model to handle more complex interactions between variables. Our
experiments demonstrate that machine learning-enhanced models significantly
outperform the traditional model. Our results show a 51.48% improvement in
R-squared, indicating a substantial enhancement in the model's explanatory
power. Also, a 63.59% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reflects a
significant increase in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a 44.32% increase in
Common Part of Commuters (CPC) demonstrates improved prediction reliability.
These findings highlight the substantial benefits of integrating diverse
datasets and advanced algorithms into transportation models. They provide urban
planners and policymakers with more reliable forecasting and decision-making
tools.

*Bonpagna Kann,Sandra Castellanos-Paez,Romain Rombourg,Philippe Lalanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TaskVAE是一个基于重放的持续学习框架，通过任务特定的变分自编码器生成合成样本，解决了动态数据环境中的模型适应问题，并在人类活动识别任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在日常生活中的广泛应用，模型需要适应动态数据环境，而数据漂移（如渐变、突变或周期性变化）威胁模型准确性。持续学习（CL）成为关键，但需平衡内存限制和旧知识的保留。

Method: TaskVAE采用任务特定的变分自编码器（VAEs）生成先前任务的合成样本，与新任务数据一起训练分类器。与传统方法不同，TaskVAE无需预先知道总类别数或依赖单一VAE，灵活适应任务增加。

Result: 在5个不同的人类活动识别数据集上，TaskVAE优于经验重放方法，尤其在数据有限时表现突出，且内存占用极低（每任务仅60样本）。

Conclusion: TaskVAE在内存限制、任务特定生成和长期稳定性之间取得平衡，为人类活动识别等现实应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life,
they unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic
data environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or
cyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential.
Continual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams
while minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies,
replay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on
balancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning
new classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in
class-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which
are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to
traditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or
rely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks
without such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using
IMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data
across all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better
reflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new
activities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE
outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and
exhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory
footprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task,
while still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples.
The contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific
generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for
real-world applications in domains like HAR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的矩阵框架，将卷积、循环和自注意力操作表示为稀疏矩阵乘法，证明了其与标准CNN、RNN和Transformer层的代数同构，并在多个任务上验证了性能匹配或超越原生模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉、序列和语言任务中采用不同的架构，但其共性被掩盖。本文旨在通过统一的矩阵框架揭示这些架构的数学共性。

Method: 通过稀疏矩阵乘法实现卷积（上三角矩阵）、循环（下三角矩阵）和自注意力（三阶张量分解），并证明其与标准层的代数同构。

Result: 在图像分类、时间序列预测和语言建模任务中，稀疏矩阵框架的性能匹配或超越原生模型，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 该框架为多样化神经网络架构提供了数学基础，并为硬件感知的网络设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential
and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying
commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts
convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix
multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix
performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a
lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally
as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with
standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical
evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet),
time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language
modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that
sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while
converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to
sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism
and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a
mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens
avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.

TL;DR: 论文研究了量化大型语言模型（LLMs）中的异常值问题，提出了一种新的度量方法和混合量化方法以减少量化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化可以降低LLMs的服务成本，但激活整数运算需要量化权重和激活值，而LLMs中的显著异常值会增加量化误差。

Method: 研究了异常值对分层量化误差的影响，探索了平滑和旋转变换的效果，并提出了一种基于通道幅度的新度量方法和混合量化方法。

Result: 提出了一种新的度量方法来可视化量化难度，并通过数学公式支持了混合量化方法的优势。

Conclusion: 通过通道级缩放和旋转的混合方法，可以有效减少量化误差，提升量化效果。

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling
faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer
arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses
challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization
error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their
effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and
rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include
introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based
on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies
channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation
of its benefits.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于误差补偿学习的ANN-to-SNN转换框架，通过可学习的阈值剪裁函数、双阈值神经元和优化的膜电位初始化策略，显著减少了转换误差，实现了高精度和超低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工神经网络（ANNs）在多种任务中表现出色，但其在资源受限环境中的部署仍面临高计算和内存需求的挑战。脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其离散脉冲事件和高效能耗成为替代方案，但现有ANN-to-SNN转换方法存在显著的精度损失和推理时间增加问题。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了SNNs在低功耗硬件上的实际应用，为实现高效实时处理提供了可能。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance
in numerous tasks, but deployment in resource-constrained environments remains
a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. Spiking
neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior
energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current
ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased
inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and
uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework
based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold
clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential
initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these
techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically
reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the
non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential.
Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our
method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion
methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the
inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10
dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical
application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time
processing possible.

Conclusion: 为提升AI抽象推理能力提供了创新方法。

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract
reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the
empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely
on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the
model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes
the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for
RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction
Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning
performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a
learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity
for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper
introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a
lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead
through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior
performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's
abstract reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine
learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of
her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great
effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an
experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical
success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might
just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation
between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and
input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly
better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer.
When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained
layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number
of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we
show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's
pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's
task.

Result: Fusion DeepONet在非断裂情况下预测更准确，但断裂驱动场景仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: Fusion DeepONet在复杂几何和时间依赖性裂纹扩展中具有泛化潜力。

Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in
engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and
cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such
as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent
developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on
constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation
and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use
data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train
operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets),
which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional
vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for
predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying
geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height
without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and
hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The
models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch
network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show
that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more
accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven
scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging.
These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across
complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.

Conclusion: GEDRanker为无监督GED计算提供了一种高效且实用的方法，解决了真实标签依赖问题。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely
used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem.
Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by
formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a
generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from
which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a
traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on
ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth labels are often costly to
obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel
unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker
consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable
preference-aware discriminator with an effective training strategy to guide the
matching-based GED solver toward generating high-quality node matching without
the need for ground-truth labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve
near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

Conclusion: SpecMemo为资源受限环境中的LLM应用提供了高效、低成本的部署方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speculative decoding have demonstrated considerable
speedup across a wide array of large language model (LLM) tasks. Speculative
decoding inherently relies on sacrificing extra memory allocations to generate
several candidate tokens, of which acceptance rate drives the speedup. However,
deploying speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices, such as mobile
GPUs, remains as a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. In this work,
we present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly
control memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with
speculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from
theoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a
lower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo
empirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory
allocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive
performance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management,
we maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench,
with reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given
multiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding
architectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing

Abstract: Data inherently possesses dual attributes: samples and targets. For targets,
knowledge distillation has been widely employed to accelerate model
convergence, primarily relying on teacher-generated soft target supervision.
Conversely, recent advancements in data-efficient learning have emphasized
sample optimization techniques, such as dataset distillation, while neglected
the critical role of target. This dichotomy motivates our investigation into
understanding how both sample and target collectively influence training
dynamic. To address this gap, we first establish a taxonomy of existing
paradigms through the lens of sample-target interactions, categorizing them
into distinct sample-to-target mapping strategies. Building upon this
foundation, we then propose a novel unified loss framework to assess their
impact on training efficiency. Through extensive empirical studies on our
proposed strategies, we comprehensively analyze how variations in target and
sample types, quantities, and qualities influence model training, providing six
key insights to enhance training efficacy.

Conclusion: 替代可解释性图方法有效解决了随机森林模型在健康信息学中的全局解释性问题。

Abstract: The field of health informatics has been profoundly influenced by the
development of random forest models, which have led to significant advances in
the interpretability of feature interactions. These models are characterized by
their robustness to overfitting and parallelization, making them particularly
useful in this domain. However, the increasing number of features and
estimators in random forests can prevent domain experts from accurately
interpreting global feature interactions, thereby compromising trust and
regulatory compliance. A method called the surrogate interpretability graph has
been developed to address this issue. It uses graphs and mixed-integer linear
programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This improves their
interpretability by visualizing the feature usage per
decision-feature-interaction table and the most dominant hierarchical decision
feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of a surrogate
interpretable graph enhances global interpretability, which is critical for
such a high-stakes domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed learning (DL) in the
presence of Byzantine attacks. For this problem, various robust bounded
aggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate
the impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules
for the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information
from Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly
when the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each
other. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with
Byzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training
begins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During
training, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the
server computed from the allocated training data, and the server then
aggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices
using RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately
recovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL
methods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact
that the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other.
This closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine
attacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those
of honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence
performance of CRA-DL. Finally, we present numerical results to verify the
superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines, showing its
enhanced learning performance under Byzantine attacks.

Abstract: Effective agent exploration remains a core challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL) for complex discrete state-space environments, particularly under
partial observability. This paper presents a decoupled hierarchical RL
framework integrating state abstraction (DcHRL-SA) to address this issue. The
proposed method employs a dual-level architecture, consisting of a high level
RL-based actor and a low-level rule-based policy, to promote effective
exploration. Additionally, state abstraction method is incorporated to cluster
discrete states, effectively lowering state dimensionality. Experiments
conducted in two discrete customized grid environments demonstrate that the
proposed approach consistently outperforms PPO in terms of exploration
efficiency, convergence speed, cumulative reward, and policy stability. These
results demonstrate a practical approach for integrating decoupled hierarchical
policies and state abstraction in discrete grids with large-scale exploration
space. Code will be available at https://github.com/XQY169/DcHRL-SA.

Abstract: Ensemble clustering has demonstrated great success in practice; however, its
theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper examines the
generalization performance of ensemble clustering, focusing on generalization
error, excess risk and consistency. We derive a convergence rate of
generalization error bound and excess risk bound both of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, with $n$ and $m$
being the numbers of samples and base clusterings. Based on this, we prove that
when $m$ and $n$ approach infinity and $m$ is significantly larger than log
$n$, i.e., $m,n\to \infty, m\gg \log n$, ensemble clustering is consistent.
Furthermore, recognizing that $n$ and $m$ are finite in practice, the
generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, by assigning varying
weights to finite clusterings, we minimize the error between the empirical
average clusterings and their expectation. From this, we theoretically
demonstrate that to achieve better clustering performance, we should minimize
the deviation (bias) of base clustering from its expectation and maximize the
differences (diversity) among various base clusterings. Additionally, we derive
that maximizing diversity is nearly equivalent to a robust (min-max)
optimization model. Finally, we instantiate our theory to develop a new
ensemble clustering algorithm. Compared with SOTA methods, our approach
achieves average improvements of 6.1%, 7.3%, and 6.0% on 10 datasets w.r.t.
NMI, ARI, and Purity. The code is available at https://github.com/xuz2019/GPEC.

Abstract: Introduction: Personal identification is a critical aspect of forensic
sciences, security, and healthcare. While conventional biometrics systems such
as DNA profiling and iris scanning offer high accuracy, they are time-consuming
and costly. Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between
fingerprint patterns and ABO blood group classification to explore potential
correlations between these two traits. Methods: The study analyzed 200
individuals, categorizing their fingerprints into three types: loops, whorls,
and arches. Blood group classification was also recorded. Statistical analysis,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation tests, was used to assess
associations between fingerprint patterns and blood groups. Results: Loops were
the most common fingerprint pattern, while blood group O+ was the most
prevalent among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no significant
correlation between fingerprint patterns and blood groups (p > 0.05),
suggesting that these traits are independent. Conclusions: Although the study
showed limited correlation between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood groups,
it highlights the importance of future research using larger and more diverse
populations, incorporating machine learning approaches, and integrating
multiple biometric signals. This study contributes to forensic science by
emphasizing the need for rigorous protocols and comprehensive investigations in
personal identification.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of
human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general
intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards
achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context
switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic
forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned
task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task
contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the
interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper
introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context
switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an
additional network that generates the weights of the primary network
dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is
input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer
vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of
previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,
Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient
Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding
dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in
enabling continual learning for improved performance.

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components
($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used
technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint
optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank
approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the
expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to
leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce
Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank
components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This
structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization,
enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank
approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B
demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework
consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and
improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

Motivation: 联邦学习中不同客户端的标签噪声问题严重影响模型性能，需要一种有效策略来减轻噪声客户端的不良影响。

Method: MaskedOptim框架分为两阶段：第一阶段检测高噪声客户端，第二阶段通过端到端标签校正机制修正噪声标签，并使用几何中位数模型聚合增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在不同场景下表现出鲁棒性，并能有效提升噪声客户端本地数据集的质量。

Conclusion: MaskedOptim框架为解决联邦学习中的标签噪声问题提供了一种有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in
privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL
participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding
annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying
levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of
the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely
attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an
effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy
clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework,
MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is
designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise
rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients'
data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the
negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by
learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via
backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the
geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla
averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct
evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label
noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results
indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different
scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances
the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes
will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are

Result: 在UCR Anomaly Archive多领域数据集上，RATFM性能接近领域内微调，但无需领域依赖的微调。

Conclusion: RATFM有效解决了时间序列基础模型在测试时适应中的局限性，提升了模型的多领域适用性。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation
models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and
anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains
and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based
prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the
context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing
normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time
series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or
utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used
during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this
limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model
(RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate
examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance
comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent
fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset
including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验表明，TCS能生成更逼真的时间序列数据，但生成真实因果数据仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: TCS为生成逼真因果时间数据提供了灵活框架，同时揭示了数据生成的多面性挑战。

Abstract: Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among
observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of
CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training,
these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even
more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified
assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and
diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal
Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic
time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is
structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the
data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning
the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which
can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics.
Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection
methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as
a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that
draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible,
model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a
thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets
and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through
experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely
synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data
remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible
causal-based temporal data.

Abstract: To increase the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, it is critical to
improve the understanding of how they make decisions. This paper introduces a
novel unsupervised concept-based model for image classification, named
Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) which models concepts as random variables
within a Bernoulli latent space. Unlike traditional methods that either require
extensive human supervision or suffer from limited scalability, our approach
employs a reduced number of concepts without sacrificing performance. We
demonstrate that LCBM surpasses existing unsupervised concept-based models in
generalization capability and nearly matches the performance of black-box
models. The proposed concept representation enhances information retention and
aligns more closely with human understanding. A user study demonstrates the
discovered concepts are also more intuitive for humans to interpret. Finally,
despite the use of concept embeddings, we maintain model interpretability by
means of a local linear combination of concepts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with

while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage
that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical
experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied
to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable,
challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with
our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual

Abstract: LibriBrain represents the largest single-subject MEG dataset to date for
speech decoding, with over 50 hours of recordings -- 5$\times$ larger than the
next comparable dataset and 50$\times$ larger than most. This unprecedented
`depth' of within-subject data enables exploration of neural representations at
a scale previously unavailable with non-invasive methods. LibriBrain comprises
high-quality MEG recordings together with detailed annotations from a single
participant listening to naturalistic spoken English, covering nearly the full
Sherlock Holmes canon. Designed to support advances in neural decoding,
LibriBrain comes with a Python library for streamlined integration with deep
learning frameworks, standard data splits for reproducibility, and baseline
results for three foundational decoding tasks: speech detection, phoneme
classification, and word classification. Baseline experiments demonstrate that
increasing training data yields substantial improvements in decoding
performance, highlighting the value of scaling up deep, within-subject
datasets. By releasing this dataset, we aim to empower the research community
to advance speech decoding methodologies and accelerate the development of
safe, effective clinical brain-computer interfaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ReconXF的图重构攻击方法，用于在公开解释和隐私化辅助数据的场景下恢复图结构，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在关键领域（如医疗和司法）的应用受限，因其黑盒特性。解释方法虽提供透明性，但也带来隐私风险，可能暴露敏感关系。

Method: 研究了一种威胁模型，攻击者利用公开的特征解释和隐私化的节点特征与标签。提出ReconXF方法，结合去噪机制处理差分隐私噪声，利用解释中的结构信号。

Result: 实验表明，ReconXF在隐私化设置下优于现有方法，AUC和平均精度均有提升。

Conclusion: 公开解释与去噪结合，即使在辅助数据隐私保护下，仍能恢复图结构。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance across many
applications but function as black-box models, limiting their use in critical
domains like healthcare and criminal justice. Explainability methods address
this by providing feature-level explanations that identify important node
attributes for predictions. These explanations create privacy risks. Combined
with auxiliary information, feature explanations can enable adversaries to
reconstruct graph structure, exposing sensitive relationships. Existing graph
reconstruction attacks assume access to original auxiliary data, but practical
systems use differential privacy to protect node features and labels while
providing explanations for transparency. We study a threat model where
adversaries access public feature explanations along with privatized node
features and labels. We show that existing explanation-based attacks like GSEF
perform poorly with privatized data due to noise from differential privacy
mechanisms. We propose ReconXF, a graph reconstruction attack for scenarios
with public explanations and privatized auxiliary data. Our method adapts
explanation-based frameworks by incorporating denoising mechanisms that handle
differential privacy noise while exploiting structural signals in explanations.
Experiments across multiple datasets show ReconXF outperforms SoTA methods in
privatized settings, with improvements in AUC and average precision. Results
indicate that public explanations combined with denoising enable graph
structure recovery even under the privacy protection of auxiliary data. Code is
available at (link to be made public after acceptance).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Layer-wise Relevance Propagation（LRP）方法，专门针对Transformer的位置编码（PE）问题，显著提升了视觉和NLP任务中的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LRP的Transformer可解释性方法忽视了位置编码的重要性，导致守恒属性被破坏和重要相关性信息的丢失。

Method: 将输入空间重新定义为位置-标记对，并设计了专门的理论基础LRP规则，适用于多种位置编码方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉和NLP任务中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过解决位置编码问题，该方法为Transformer的可解释性提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of effective explainability tools for Transformers is a
crucial pursuit in deep learning research. One of the most promising approaches
in this domain is Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which propagates
relevance scores backward through the network to the input space by
redistributing activation values based on predefined rules. However, existing
LRP-based methods for Transformer explainability entirely overlook a critical
component of the Transformer architecture: its positional encoding (PE),
resulting in violation of the conservation property, and the loss of an
important and unique type of relevance, which is also associated with
structural and positional features. To address this limitation, we reformulate
the input space for Transformer explainability as a set of position-token
pairs. This allows us to propose specialized theoretically-grounded LRP rules
designed to propagate attributions across various positional encoding methods,
including Rotary, Learnable, and Absolute PE. Extensive experiments with both
fine-tuned classifiers and zero-shot foundation models, such as LLaMA 3,
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in
both vision and NLP explainability tasks. Our code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Z-Error Loss的方法，通过统计原理减少异常值对神经网络训练的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常值在神经网络训练中会传播错误的梯度，从而降低模型性能和泛化能力。

Method: 利用批次级统计自动检测并排除异常样本，通过Z-Error Loss最小化异常值的影响。

Result: 该方法具有鲁棒性，能适应数据质量，并为数据清理提供诊断工具。

Conclusion: Z-Error Loss是一种有效的解决方案，可提升模型对真实数据结构的关注。

Abstract: Outliers introduce significant training challenges in neural networks by
propagating erroneous gradients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. We propose the Z-Error Loss, a statistically principled
approach that minimizes outlier influence during training by masking the
contribution of data points identified as out-of-distribution within each
batch. This method leverages batch-level statistics to automatically detect and
exclude anomalous samples, allowing the model to focus its learning on the true
underlying data structure. Our approach is robust, adaptive to data quality,
and provides valuable diagnostics for data curation and cleaning.

Conclusion: 逼近理论在机器学习中应发挥更核心的作用，新方法为解决通用性问题提供了方向。

Abstract: A central problem in machine learning is often formulated as follows: Given a
dataset $\{(x_j, y_j)\}_{j=1}^M$, which is a sample drawn from an unknown
probability distribution, the goal is to construct a functional model $f$ such
that $f(x) \approx y$ for any $(x, y)$ drawn from the same distribution. Neural
networks and kernel-based methods are commonly employed for this task due to
their capacity for fast and parallel computation. The approximation
capabilities, or expressive power, of these methods have been extensively
studied over the past 35 years. In this paper, we will present examples of key
ideas in this area found in the literature. We will discuss emerging trends in
machine learning including the role of shallow/deep networks, approximation on
manifolds, physics-informed neural surrogates, neural operators, and
transformer architectures. Despite function approximation being a fundamental
problem in machine learning, approximation theory does not play a central role
in the theoretical foundations of the field. One unfortunate consequence of
this disconnect is that it is often unclear how well trained models will
generalize to unseen or unlabeled data. In this review, we examine some of the
shortcomings of the current machine learning framework and explore the reasons
for the gap between approximation theory and machine learning practice. We will
then introduce our novel research to achieve function approximation on unknown
manifolds without the need to learn specific manifold features, such as the
eigen-decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator or atlas construction. In
many machine learning problems, particularly classification tasks, the labels
$y_j$ are drawn from a finite set of values.

*Shiangyi Lin,Hui Lan,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过将工具变量（IV）信息融入高维治疗变量的表示学习过程，解决了传统IV估计器在处理高维非结构化治疗变量时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IV估计器在处理高维非结构化治疗变量时存在局限性，且无监督降维方法可能导致遗漏变量偏差。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，在表示学习过程中显式结合工具变量信息，构建治疗表示。

Result: 理论和实验证明，该方法能够识别优化结果预测的方向，优于传统两阶段方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理高维内生变量提供了新框架，显著提升了IV回归分析的性能。

Abstract: Traditional instrumental variable (IV) estimators face a fundamental
constraint: they can only accommodate as many endogenous treatment variables as
available instruments. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in
settings where the treatment is presented in a high-dimensional and
unstructured manner (e.g. descriptions of patient treatment pathways in a
hospital). In such settings, researchers typically resort to applying
unsupervised dimension reduction techniques to learn a low-dimensional
treatment representation prior to implementing IV regression analysis. We show
that such methods can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias due to
implicit regularization in the representation learning step. We propose a novel
approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating
instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach
provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with
limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures
identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction. Our experiments
show that our proposed methodology improves upon the conventional two-stage
approaches that perform dimension reduction without incorporating instrument
information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种约束学习方法，用于优化Sliced Wasserstein（SW）距离的切片方向，以减少计算复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SW距离在比较高维概率测度时需要大量切片方向，导致计算复杂度高且性能受限。

Method: 通过约束1D传输计划以近似原始空间中的最优计划，利用梯度对偶方法训练切片参数。

Result: 在图像、点云和蛋白质序列的基础模型上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 约束学习方法能更高效地学习有意义的切片方向，提升SW距离的性能。

Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing
high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple
1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative
slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number
of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational
complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the
slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D
transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring
meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these
transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the
slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how
this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional
embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical
results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein
sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach
in learning more informative slicing directions. Our implementation code can be
found at https://github.com/Stranja572/constrainedswe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy
often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we
propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight
enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for
principled information aggregation and diversity control.
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman
centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling
within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between
Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM
pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks,
a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution
quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

TL;DR: KDRL是一种结合知识蒸馏（KD）和强化学习（RL）的统一后训练框架，旨在提升大语言模型的推理能力，平衡性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL能激发复杂推理行为但样本效率低，KD学习效率高但泛化能力差，因此需要一种结合两者的方法。

Method: KDRL通过策略梯度优化同时最小化学生与教师分布的反向KL散度（RKL）和最大化基于规则的奖励。

Result: 实验表明KDRL在多个推理基准上优于GRPO和KD基线，平衡了性能和推理效率。

Conclusion: 结合KD和RL是训练推理LLM的有效且高效策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged
two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement
learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence
of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency
when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories.
Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but
tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present
\textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly
optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and
self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient
optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence
(RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the
expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that
integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL
approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the
overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD
baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning
token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as
an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络参数和计算资源需求不断增加，现有方法（如剪枝或量化）未能充分利用对称性冗余。

Method: 利用交换性统计特性形式化对称性，提出动态剪枝算法ExPrune，并通过预测ReLU负输入实现神经元级剪枝。

Result: 在多种模型上测试，ExPrune显著减少FLOPs（10.98-39.05%），精度损失可忽略或控制在1%以内。

Conclusion: ExPrune有效减少对称性冗余，且与静态剪枝兼容，进一步优化模型效率。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are equipped with increasingly many parameters and
require more and more resource for deployment. Researchers have explored
various ways to improve the efficiency of NNs by identifying and reducing the
redundancy, such as pruning or quantizing unimportant weights. Symmetry in the
NN architectures has been identified by prior work as a possible type of
redundancy, but exploiting it for efficient inference is not yet explored. In
this work, we formalize the symmetry of parameters and intermediate values in
NNs using the statistical property of exchangeablility. We identify that
exchangeable values in NN computation may contain overlapping information,
leading to redundancy. Exploiting the insight, we derive a principled general
dynamic pruning algorithm ExPrune to remove symmetry-induced redundancy on a
per-input basis. We also provide an instantiation of ExPrune that performs
neuron-level dynamic pruning by predicting negative inputs to ReLU activations.
We evaluate ExPrune on two computer vision models, one graph model and one
language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--26.3% reduction in FLOPs with
negligible accuracy drop and 21.01--39.05% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1%
accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static pruning.
On models that have been aggressively pruned statically, ExPrune provides
additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and
13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many
real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble
models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences.
We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification
using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our
ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range
connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic
datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the
task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance
observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how
quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract
informative features and build models that can learn and generalize
effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other
researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles.
Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope
for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological
samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.

Conclusion: UrbanX不仅适用于道路安全研究，还可作为通用框架，从非结构化城市数据中提取结构化见解，为城市科学发现提供可扩展且可解释的路径。

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically
meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as
road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning,
development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However,
traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human
experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to
confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning
approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode
critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference,
enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses
concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs
to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract
interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in
regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis
testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient
significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously
overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental
evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full
interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose
framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from
unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental
outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications
and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable
knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

Result: 实验表明auGraph在关系与表格预测任务中优于基于模式和启发式的图构建方法。

Conclusion: auGraph通过任务感知的图增强，有效提升了表格和关系数据的学习性能。

Abstract: Tabular and relational data remain the most ubiquitous formats in real-world
machine learning applications, spanning domains from finance to healthcare.
Although both formats offer structured representations, they pose distinct
challenges for modern deep learning methods, which typically assume flat,
feature-aligned inputs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising solution by capturing structural dependencies within and between
tables. However, existing GNN-based approaches often rely on rigid,
schema-derived graphs -- such as those based on primary-foreign key links --
thereby underutilizing rich, predictive signals in non key attributes. In this
work, we introduce auGraph, a unified framework for task-aware graph
augmentation that applies to both tabular and relational data. auGraph enhances
base graph structures by selectively promoting attributes into nodes, guided by
scoring functions that quantify their relevance to the downstream prediction
task. This augmentation preserves the original data schema while injecting
task-relevant structural signal. Empirically, auGraph outperforms schema-based
and heuristic graph construction methods by producing graphs that better
support learning for relational and tabular prediction tasks.

Abstract: Most existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks focus on robotics
and control tasks, offering limited relevance to high-stakes domains that
involve structured constraints, mixed-integer decisions, and industrial
complexity. This gap hinders the advancement and deployment of safe RL in
critical areas such as energy systems, manufacturing, and supply chains. To
address this limitation, we present SafeOR-Gym, a benchmark suite of nine
operations research (OR) environments tailored for safe RL under complex
constraints. Each environment captures a realistic planning, scheduling, or
control problems characterized by cost-based constraint violations, planning
horizons, and hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces. The suite integrates
seamlessly with the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) interface
provided by OmniSafe. We evaluate several state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms
across these environments, revealing a wide range of performance: while some
tasks are tractable, others expose fundamental limitations in current
approaches. SafeOR-Gym provides a challenging and practical testbed that aims
to catalyze future research in safe RL for real-world decision-making problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因个体差异和健康条件导致的生理信号变化，使机器学习模型难以泛化的问题，特别关注阿片类药物使用障碍（OUD）患者的压力检测。

Method: 提出了一种称为“person-wise sub-network pruning intersection”的新技术，专注于跨个体的共享特征，并利用连续标签防止过拟合。

Result: 在七个不同压力数据集上测试，HHISS始终优于现有基线方法，适用于现实世界应用。

Conclusion: HHISS在敏感现实应用中具有可行性和可扩展性，为移动压力检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Stress affects physical and mental health, and wearable devices have been
widely used to detect daily stress through physiological signals. However,
these signals vary due to factors such as individual differences and health
conditions, making generalizing machine learning models difficult. To address
these challenges, we present Human Heterogeneity Invariant Stress Sensing
(HHISS), a domain generalization approach designed to find consistent patterns
in stress signals by removing person-specific differences. This helps the model
perform more accurately across new people, environments, and stress types not
seen during training. Its novelty lies in proposing a novel technique called
person-wise sub-network pruning intersection to focus on shared features across
individuals, alongside preventing overfitting by leveraging continuous labels
while training. The study focuses especially on people with opioid use disorder
(OUD)-a group where stress responses can change dramatically depending on their
time of daily medication taking. Since stress often triggers cravings, a model
that can adapt well to these changes could support better OUD rehabilitation
and recovery. We tested HHISS on seven different stress datasets-four of which
we collected ourselves and three public ones. Four are from lab setups, one
from a controlled real-world setting, driving, and two are from real-world
in-the-wild field datasets without any constraints. This is the first study to
evaluate how well a stress detection model works across such a wide range of
data. Results show HHISS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baseline
methods, proving both effective and practical for real-world use. Ablation
studies, empirical justifications, and runtime evaluations confirm HHISS's
feasibility and scalability for mobile stress sensing in sensitive real-world
applications.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective for tasks with known
underlying symmetries. However, optimizing equivariant networks can be tricky
and best training practices are less established than for standard networks. In
particular, recent works have found small training benefits from relaxing
equivariance constraints. This raises the question: do equivariance constraints
introduce fundamental obstacles to optimization? Or do they simply require
different hyperparameter tuning? In this work, we investigate this question
through a theoretical analysis of the loss landscape geometry. We focus on
networks built using permutation representations, which we can view as a subset
of unconstrained MLPs. Importantly, we show that the parameter symmetries of
the unconstrained model has nontrivial effects on the loss landscape of the
equivariant subspace and under certain conditions can provably prevent learning
of the global minima. Further, we empirically demonstrate in such cases,
relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes solve the issue. Interestingly,
the weights eventually found via relaxation corresponds to a different choice
of group representation in the hidden layer. From this, we draw 3 key
takeaways. (1) Viewing any class of networks in the context of larger
unconstrained function space can give important insights on loss landscape
structure. (2) Within the unconstrained function space, equivariant networks
form a complicated union of linear hyperplanes, each associated with a specific
choice of internal group representation. (3) Effective relaxation of
equivariance may require not only adding nonequivariant degrees of freedom, but
also rethinking the fixed choice of group representations in hidden layers.

Motivation: Stochastic Interpolants (SI) 在联合优化的潜在变量模型中未被探索，因其需要直接访问两个分布的样本。LSI 旨在解决这一问题。

Result: LSI 在 ImageNet 生成基准测试中表现出色，避免了高维空间的直接计算需求。

Conclusion: LSI 保留了 SI 框架的生成灵活性，同时解决了计算和简单先验问题。

Abstract: Stochastic Interpolants (SI) are a powerful framework for generative
modeling, capable of flexibly transforming between two probability
distributions. However, their use in jointly optimized latent variable models
remains unexplored as they require direct access to the samples from the two
distributions. This work presents Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enabling
joint learning in a latent space with end-to-end optimized encoder, decoder and
latent SI models. We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower
Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time. The joint
optimization allows LSI to learn effective latent representations along with a
generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the
encoder-defined aggregated posterior. LSI sidesteps the simple priors of the
normal diffusion models and mitigates the computational demands of applying SI
directly in high-dimensional observation spaces, while preserving the
generative flexibility of the SI framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSI
through comprehensive experiments on the standard large scale ImageNet
generation benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GAIN-RL的框架，通过利用模型内在的角度集中信号动态选择训练数据，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化微调（RFT）范式因均匀数据采样导致的样本效率低下问题，现有方法忽略了模型自身生成的学习信号。

Method: 提出GAIN-RL框架，利用角度集中信号动态选择数据，确保梯度更新的有效性。

Result: 实验表明GAIN-RL在数学和编程任务中训练效率提升2.5倍，且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: GAIN-RL通过动态数据选择显著提升了训练效率和数据利用率。

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models
(LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of
identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored
curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit
limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model
itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify
a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an
LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden
state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for
data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we
propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By
leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL
dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently
impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training
efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x
acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding
tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient
sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half
the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data. Code is

Conclusion: 修正方法解决了梯度范数问题，提升了训练效果。

Abstract: During long-duration Large Language Model (LLM) training runs the gradient
norm increases rapidly near the end of training. In this short note, we show
that this increase is due to an unintended interaction between weight decay,
normalization layers, and the learning rate schedule. We propose a simple
correction that fixes this behavior while also resulting in lower loss values
throughout training.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks provide a principled framework for incorporating
symmetry into learning architectures and have been extensively analyzed through
the lens of their separation power, that is, the ability to distinguish inputs
modulo symmetry. This notion plays a central role in settings such as graph
learning, where it is often formalized via the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy. In
contrast, the universality of equivariant models-their capacity to approximate
target functions-remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the approximation power of equivariant neural networks beyond
separation constraints. We show that separation power does not fully capture
expressivity: models with identical separation power may differ in their
approximation ability. To demonstrate this, we characterize the universality
classes of shallow invariant networks, providing a general framework for
understanding which functions these architectures can approximate. Since
equivariant models reduce to invariant ones under projection, this analysis
yields sufficient conditions under which shallow equivariant networks fail to
be universal. Conversely, we identify settings where shallow models do achieve
separation-constrained universality. These positive results, however, depend
critically on structural properties of the symmetry group, such as the
existence of adequate normal subgroups, which may not hold in important cases
like permutation symmetry.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成感知对齐且语义明确的变换，揭示了分类器决策边界的几何特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经分类器的内部表示提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep
neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing
interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not
elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes
would transition an input from one category to another. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path
between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal
motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first
decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable
Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space.
Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we
amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation
to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the
steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically
meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most
sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision
boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically
meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural
classifiers' internal representations.

Abstract: We present CACTI, a masked autoencoding approach for imputing tabular data
that leverages the structure in missingness patterns and contextual
information. Our approach employs a novel median truncated copy masking
training strategy that encourages the model to learn from empirical patterns of
missingness while incorporating semantic relationships between features -
captured by column names and text descriptions - to better represent feature
dependence. These dual sources of inductive bias enable CACTI to outperform
state-of-the-art methods - an average $R^2$ gain of 7.8% over the next best
method (13.4%, 6.1%, and 5.3% under missing not at random, at random and
completely at random, respectively) - across a diverse range of datasets and
missingness conditions. Our results highlight the value of leveraging

Result: MINT在多模态指令微调中显著优于现有基线，平衡了泛化与专业化。

Conclusion: 任务分组策略（MINT）能有效提升多模态模型的性能，避免不匹配任务的干扰。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved
state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are
largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale,
unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated
labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in
scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and
scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of
instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance.
Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across
modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing
modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to
discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn
transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from
mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly
effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction.
We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task
grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective
balance between generalization and specialization.

Motivation: 传统测试点方法因飞行员偏离预设条件而失效，且数据带和容差的存在是更根本的问题。

Method: 使用高保真数字模型和机器学习生成ROM，通过高斯过程回归更新模型。

Result: 通过T-38C飞行测试数据验证，ROM能够生成符合MIL-STD-1797B标准的参数。

Conclusion: 该方法通过实时更新ROM，提高了飞行测试的灵活性和准确性。

Abstract: The justification for the "test point" derives from the test pilot's
obligation to reproduce faithfully the pre-specified conditions of some model
prediction. Pilot deviation from those conditions invalidates the model
assumptions. Flight test aids have been proposed to increase accuracy on more
challenging test points. However, the very existence of databands and
tolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We
propose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a
high-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to
generate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a
reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can
generate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,
if the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can
be updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM
at whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the
high-fidelity model. We present a single example of this "point-less"
architecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft
model to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface. We then
ingest unconstrained flight test data and use Gaussian Process Regression to
update and condition the hypersurface. By proposing a second-order equivalent
system for the T-38C, this hypersurface then generates parameters necessary to
assess MIL-STD-1797B compliance for longitudinal dynamics.

Conclusion: 本文为吸收率矩阵的离散扩散模型提供了理论支持，并提出了解决其独特挑战的新技术工具。

Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in
applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has
also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of
rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While
empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better
generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical
works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably,
convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are
still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and
convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate
matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the
forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address
the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a
singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the
first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization
samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their
counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable
assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our
analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to
absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding
forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score
functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization
that removes the need of early-stopping.

Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem to estimate probability densities in the
context of multidimensional problems that are sampled with uneven probability.
It considers detector sensitivity as an heterogeneous density and takes
advantage of the computational speed and flexible boundary conditions offered
by splines on a grid. We choose to regularize the Hessian of the spline via the
nuclear norm to promote sparsity. As a result, the method is spatially adaptive
and stable against the choice of the regularization parameter, which plays the
role of the bandwidth. We test our computational pipeline on standard densities
and provide software. We also present a new approach to PET rebinning as an
application of our framework.

Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations
across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and
fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning
Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for
problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying
partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus
and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge
values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty
quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a
subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel
complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces
conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two
representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood
flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity,
highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and
reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.

Conclusion: 提供了一种简单有效的RL训练定理证明器的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective framework for training
large language models on structured language-conditioned tasks. We identify a
critical flaw of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a widely used RL
algorithm in this setting. For tasks that require multi-sample performance,
such as formal theorem proving, GRPO biasedly reinforces already probable
solutions and neglects rare but correct proofs. This implicit bias impairs
performance on pass@$N$ metrics at large sample sizes, limiting its
practicality for training theorem provers. To address this, we introduce the
unlikeliness reward, a straightforward method that explicitly encourages
reinforcing rare correct solutions. Additionally, we find that increasing the
number of PPO epochs further mitigates this bias. Our experiments confirm that
incorporating the unlikeliness reward significantly improves pass@$N$ across a
large range of N, outperforming standard GRPO and substantially increasing
sample diversity. Applying our revised recipe to Lean, we achieve competitive
performance with DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We
release our implementation, providing a simple yet effective recipe for
training formal theorem provers with RL.

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify
agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental
aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when
these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles
indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a
lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to
evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety
principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting
lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes
the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of
LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers
preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and
discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing
controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles
is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI
systems.

Motivation: 现有的零阶随机梯度下降（ZO-SGD）方法在联邦学习中通信效率高，但梯度估计的高方差导致收敛慢。利用Hessian信息可以加速优化，但如何在保持维度无关通信的同时整合Hessian信息是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种广义的标量通信框架，将维度无关通信与ZO-SGD解耦，并在此基础上开发了HiSo方法，利用全局曲率信息加速收敛。

Result: 理论分析表明HiSo收敛速度更快，尤其是在全局Hessian具有低有效秩时。实验验证了HiSo在收敛速度和通信效率上的显著优势。

Conclusion: HiSo通过结合Hessian信息和标量通信，成功解决了ZO-SGD在联邦学习中的收敛慢问题，为大语言模型微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent dimension-free communication frameworks in Federated Learning (FL),
such as DeComFL, significantly reduce per-round communication by transmitting
only scalars via zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). This method
is particularly advantageous for federated fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Yet, the high variance in ZO gradient estimation typically leads to
slow convergence. Although leveraging Hessian information is known to enhance
optimization speed, integrating this into FL presents significant challenges.
These include clients' restrictions on local data and the critical need to
maintain the dimension-free communication property. To overcome this
limitation, we first introduce a generalized scalar-only communication FL
framework that decouples dimension-free communication from standard ZO-SGD,
enabling the integration of more advanced optimization strategies. Building on
this framework, we propose HiSo, a fast federated fine-tuning method via
Hessian-informed zeroth-order optimization and Scalar-only communication.
Specifically, it leverages global curvature information to accelerate
convergence while preserving the same minimal communication cost per round.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees that are independent of the
global Lipschitz constant, and further show that HiSo achieves faster rates
when the global Hessian exhibits a low effective rank -- a common phenomenon in
LLMs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and LLM fine-tuning tasks
confirm that HiSo significantly outperforms existing ZO-based FL methods in
both convergence speed and communication efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成性能上表现优异，但依赖大数据集且易记忆敏感数据，引发隐私问题。

Result: Online SFBD在多个基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SFBD flow通过简化实现和提升性能，为隐私保护扩散模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve strong generative performance but often rely on
large datasets that may include sensitive content. This challenge is compounded
by the models' tendency to memorize training data, raising privacy concerns.
SFBD (Lu et al., 2025) addresses this by training on corrupted data and using
limited clean samples to capture local structure and improve convergence.
However, its iterative denoising and fine-tuning loop requires manual
coordination, making it burdensome to implement. We reinterpret SFBD as an
alternating projection algorithm and introduce a continuous variant, SFBD flow,
that removes the need for alternating steps. We further show its connection to
consistency constraint-based methods, and demonstrate that its practical
instantiation, Online SFBD, consistently outperforms strong baselines across
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体动态规划和强化学习中，值分解技术广泛应用，但其理论依据尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入“马尔可夫纠缠”概念，类比量子纠缠，分析多智能体MDP的转移矩阵性质，并证明其与分解误差的关系。

Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent
dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value
function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the
sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$.
This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit
problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the
theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively
remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables
value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process
(MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not
"entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics.
Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we
introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and
show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general
multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class
of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal
O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we
show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice,
providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value
decomposition.

Result: 算法在多种问题实例中验证有效，错误概率指数衰减，且性能优于基准算法。

Conclusion: 新算法在线性老虎机问题中实现了理论最优的错误概率衰减率，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has
attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains
in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability
approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple
setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address
this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We
introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that
guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay
rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound
derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a
posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule
involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations
with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the
identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate
the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations
across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The
results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method
outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Result: LLMPred在多个LLMs上表现优于现有基线方法，并通过消融实验验证关键组件的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMPred为LLMs在时间序列预测中的应用提供了有效方法，具有实际潜力。

Abstract: Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world
dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and
ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their
effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data
remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances
LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text
and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data
pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition
to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences.
Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data
using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with
smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B
demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared
to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study
highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于粒度计算的两阶段框架GAdaBoost，通过数据粒化和自适应提升阶段，提高了多类分类任务中标签噪声的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>

Motivation: AdaBoost在多类分类任务中面临标签噪声的挑战，现有方法要么缺乏有效处理噪声的机制，要么因冗余数据使用导致计算成本高。

Method: 提出GAdaBoost框架，包括数据粒化阶段和自适应提升阶段，并扩展SAMME算法为GAdaBoost.SA，通过粒度球生成方法压缩数据并减少噪声影响。

Result: 在噪声数据集上的实验表明，GAdaBoost.SA在鲁棒性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAdaBoost有效扩展了AdaBoost和SAMME，为处理标签噪声提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label
noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Existing methods either
lack mechanisms to handle label noise effectively or suffer from high
computational costs due to redundant data usage. Inspired by granular
computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel
two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive
boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. To
validate its feasibility, an extension of SAMME, termed GAdaBoost.SA, is
proposed. Specifically, first, a granular-ball generation method is designed to
compress data while preserving diversity and mitigating label noise. Second,
the granular ball-based SAMME algorithm focuses on granular balls rather than
individual samples, improving efficiency and reducing sensitivity to noise.
Experimental results on some noisy datasets show that the proposed approach
achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods,
demonstrating that this work effectively extends AdaBoost and SAMME.

*Yuanyao Chen,Rongsheng Chen,Fu Luo,Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的学习框架，解决了神经组合优化（NCO）在小规模训练数据上表现良好但在大规模场景下性能下降的问题。该方法通过投影训练和测试分布，提升了NCO模型的扩展性，且无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCO方法在小规模实例（如100节点）上表现良好，但在大规模场景下性能显著下降，原因是训练和测试数据之间的分布偏移。

Method: 引入基于LLM的学习框架，学习训练和测试分布之间的投影，并在推理阶段应用以提升模型扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使基于100节点训练的模型在10万节点的TSP和CVRP问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了NCO在大规模问题上的扩展性问题，且无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising
learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by
minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO
methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated
considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance
significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation
arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data,
rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the
training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the
scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that
necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates
exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model
retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a
backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance
on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 随机傅里叶特征作为经典核方法工具，被重新用于表格数据深度学习的预处理步骤，通过固定特征空间投影加速训练并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格深度学习管道存在不足（通过NTK分析揭示），需要一种无需额外学习嵌入或归一化的预处理方法。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶映射（正弦和余弦投影）将输入投影到固定特征空间，频率在初始化时随机生成。

Result: 该方法通过NTK框架证明能限制和调节初始NTK谱，缩短优化轨迹，加速训练；实验显示网络收敛更快且性能更强。

Conclusion: 随机傅里叶预处理是一种理论支持、即插即用的表格深度学习增强方法。

Abstract: While random Fourier features are a classic tool in kernel methods, their
utility as a pre-processing step for deep learning on tabular data has been
largely overlooked. Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning
pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit
and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free,
architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed
feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at
initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or
additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this
mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii)
introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby
accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network
with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep
networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and
consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less
hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as
a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.

Result: 在概率太阳能预测中，AERO显著提高了预测准确性、可靠性和适应性，尤其在噪声和不确定性环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: AERO为优化理论和实践提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Optimization remains a fundamental pillar of machine learning, yet existing
methods often struggle to maintain stability and adaptability in dynamic, non
linear systems, especially under uncertainty. We introduce AERO (Adversarial
Energy-based Redirection Optimization), a novel framework inspired by the
redirection principle in Judo, where external disturbances are leveraged rather
than resisted. AERO reimagines optimization as a redirection process guided by
15 interrelated axioms encompassing adversarial correction, energy
conservation, and disturbance-aware learning. By projecting gradients,
integrating uncertainty driven dynamics, and managing learning energy, AERO
offers a principled approach to stable and robust model updates. Applied to
probabilistic solar energy forecasting, AERO demonstrates substantial gains in
predictive accuracy, reliability, and adaptability, especially in noisy and
uncertain environments. Our findings highlight AERO as a compelling new
direction in the theoretical and practical landscape of optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的节点分类常受标签稀缺和噪声影响，特别是在高风险领域，如人口贩运检测和虚假信息监测。

Method: WSNET结合图结构、节点特征和多个噪声监督源，通过针对弱标记数据设计的对比目标进行学习。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和合成基准测试中，WSNET的F1分数比现有方法高出15%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，弱监督下的对比学习有效，且在不完美标签的图数据中具有潜力。

Abstract: Node classification in real world graphs often suffers from label scarcity
and noise, especially in high stakes domains like human trafficking detection
and misinformation monitoring. While direct supervision is limited, such graphs
frequently contain weak signals, noisy or indirect cues, that can still inform
learning. We propose WSNET, a novel weakly supervised graph contrastive
learning framework that leverages these weak signals to guide robust
representation learning. WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and
multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for
weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks
with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art
contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive learning under weak
supervision and the promise of exploiting imperfect labels in graph based
settings.

Result: 在340M/1.3B参数的大规模语料上训练，Comba在语言和视觉建模中表现出优越性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: Comba作为一种新型非线性RNN，通过创新的状态转移和反馈机制，显著提升了序列建模的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and
RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent
memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space
models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models
introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector,
resulting in a nonlinear recursive structure. In this paper, we first introduce
the concept of Nonlinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages
and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we
propose a novel Nonlinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a
scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output
feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise
parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on
large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates its superior performance and computation
efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理非光滑非凸FCCO问题时存在高迭代复杂度和不适用于深度学习的问题，亟需更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出随机动量方法，适用于非光滑FCCO问题，并提供收敛性保证。

Result: 将迭代复杂度从$O(1/\epsilon^6)$降至$O(1/\epsilon^5)$，并在多个任务中验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了FCCO问题的优化效率，为相关机器学习问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (FCCO), characterized by its
coupled compositional objective structure, emerges as an important optimization
paradigm for addressing a wide range of machine learning problems. In this
paper, we focus on a challenging class of non-convex non-smooth FCCO, where the
outer functions are non-smooth weakly convex or convex and the inner functions
are smooth or weakly convex. Existing state-of-the-art result face two key
limitations: (1) a high iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^6)$ under the
assumption that the stochastic inner functions are Lipschitz continuous in
expectation; (2) reliance on vanilla SGD-type updates, which are not suitable
for deep learning applications. Our main contributions are two fold: (i) We
propose stochastic momentum methods tailored for non-smooth FCCO that come with
provable convergence guarantees; (ii) We establish a new state-of-the-art
iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$. Moreover, we apply our algorithms to
multiple inequality constrained non-convex optimization problems involving
smooth or weakly convex functional inequality constraints. By optimizing a
smoothed hinge penalty based formulation, we achieve a new state-of-the-art
complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$ for finding an (nearly) $\epsilon$-level KKT
solution. Experiments on three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms.

Result: 在OSWorld生产力任务中，VerificAgent比基线代理成功率提高了111.1%。

Conclusion: VerificAgent有效管理记忆，显著提升代理性能，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation allows computer-use agents (CUAs) to learn from
past interactions and refine their task-solving strategies over time. However,
unchecked memory accumulation can introduce spurious or hallucinated
"learnings" that degrade agent performance, particularly in domain-specific
workflows such as productivity software. We present a novel framework,
VerificAgent, that effectively manages memory for CUAs through (1) an
expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory
refinement during training, and (3) a post-hoc fact-checking pass by human
experts to sanitize accumulated memory before deployment. On OSWorld
productivity tasks, VerificAgent achieves a 111.1% relative improvement in
success rate over baseline CUA without any additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在保护隐私时忽视了输出质量，导致模型产生退化、幻觉或过度拒绝等不良行为。

Method: 提出了一种新的遗忘任务，要求模型在保护隐私的同时提供信息丰富且视觉相关的响应，并设计了PUBG方法，引导模型输出符合期望的分布。

Result: 实验表明，PUBG在避免隐私泄露的同时，显著改善了输出质量，避免了现有方法的副作用。

Conclusion: PUBG为LVLMs的隐私保护提供了一种更优的解决方案，兼顾了隐私和输出质量。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data.
However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute
outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable
behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses.
We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider
the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than
relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new
unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving
yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel
unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a
desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods
suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy
violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually
grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten
targets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in
histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have
not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an
important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties,
particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes,
edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed
of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques
to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a
heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN
architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both
glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to
consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our
HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney
transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms
several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all
baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at

Result: 发现现有方法具备建模令牌级奖励信号的能力，提出新算法TRePO，简化且高效。

Conclusion: 为LLM微调提供理论支持，开发者可专注于优化响应级奖励模型，提升实用性。

Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language
models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e.,
intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward,
while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This
assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are
often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we
provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy
Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown
token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level
reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not,
for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals
that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess
the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical
justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way
for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat
training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level
reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of
popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and
practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new
algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically
grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency,
and holds promise for broad applicability.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of achieving Differential Privacy (DP) in
Federated Learning (FL) under partial-participation, where only a subset of the
machines participate in each time-step. While previous work achieved optimal
performance in full-participation settings, these methods struggled to extend
to partial-participation scenarios. Our approach fills this gap by introducing
a novel noise-cancellation mechanism that preserves privacy without sacrificing
convergence rates or computational efficiency. We analyze our method within the
Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) framework and show that it delivers
optimal performance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.
This work expands the applicability of DP in FL, offering an efficient and
practical solution for privacy-preserving learning in distributed systems with
partial participation.

attention module remains a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, even with
techniques like KVCache to mitigate redundant computations. While various
top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by
exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a
balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA
(Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates
low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process.
Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to
seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA
maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk
score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k
attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to
7.2$\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model
accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention
methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models
and diverse tasks. HATA is open source at https://github.com/gpzlx1/HATA.

### [229] [Reachability Weighted Offline Goal-conditioned Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02577)
*Wenyan Yang,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS)的方法，用于改进离线目标条件强化学习中的采样策略，通过优先选择有助于实现目标的转换，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习中，均匀采样会导致大量不可达的状态-目标-动作对，降低策略性能。因此，需要一种更高效的采样方法。

Method: 提出RWS方法，利用正未标记学习训练可达性分类器，为状态-动作对分配可达性分数，并以此作为采样优先级。

Result: 在六个复杂的模拟机器人操作任务中，RWS显著提升了性能，其中HandBlock-Z任务的性能提升了近50%。

Conclusion: RWS是一种有效的采样方法，能够显著提升离线目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) relies on fixed datasets
where many potential goals share the same state and action spaces. However,
these potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected
trajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to
sample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods
such as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large
dataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable
state-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is
that sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this
end, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability
classifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned
state-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score,
which is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that
integrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six
complex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm
and a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance. In one
notable case, performance on the HandBlock-Z task improved by nearly 50 percent
relative to the baseline. These results indicate the effectiveness of
reachability-weighted sampling.

Conclusion: 本文讨论了聚类质量与数据量之间的权衡，为自动驾驶系统的安全评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a
fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe
release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring
traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline
for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category
completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder
(CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and
utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario
categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the
completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The
results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work.
The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to
maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD
dataset.

also demonstrates superior scalability, faster convergence, higher sample

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对比自监督学习在异构图数据中需要精心设计图增强策略和样本对相似度的问题。

Method: 提出HGOT方法，利用最优传输机制替代传统对比学习中的正负样本采样，通过聚合视图和最优传输计划对齐语义信息。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，HGOT在节点分类等任务中表现优异，准确率平均提升6%以上。

Conclusion: HGOT通过最优传输机制简化了自监督学习过程，显著提升了异构图数据的学习效果。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), have demonstrated excellent
capabilities in processing heterogeneous information networks. Self-supervised
learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised
strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this
approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies
and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level
of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we
propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal
Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised
learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies.
Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs
the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of
positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view
(central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views
represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an
optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the
semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the
optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations,
forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the
graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node
classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in
accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Siamese网络块的代理模型方法（SiamNAS），用于高效预测神经网络架构搜索（NAS）中的支配关系，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NAS是多目标的，需要在准确性、参数数量和计算成本之间权衡，但其计算开销巨大且难以高效解决。

Method: 采用Siamese网络块构建代理模型，预测候选架构的支配关系，并用启发式规则替代拥挤距离计算。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-201上，SiamNAS以0.01 GPU天找到Pareto最优解，包含CIFAR-10的最佳架构和ImageNet的第二佳架构。

Conclusion: Siamese网络代理模型在多任务优化中具有潜力，并可扩展为生成Pareto集集合（SOS），为异构任务提供多样化解。

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective,
balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost.
This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to
solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel
surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network
blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures.
Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces
the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a
heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS,
this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process.
Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify
Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The
proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best
architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in
terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study
highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to
generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation
across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for
generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal
solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HAM（Hyperbolic Aware Minimization）的优化算法，通过交替执行优化步骤和双曲镜像步骤，解决了过参数化导致的收敛慢问题，并在多种任务中提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型的泛化行为与优化算法的隐式偏差密切相关。过参数化虽然能促进稀疏性，但会导致有效学习率降低，从而减缓收敛速度。HAM旨在克服这一障碍。

Method: HAM交替执行优化步骤和新的双曲镜像步骤，结合梯度下降推导了黎曼梯度流，改进了收敛性，并保持了双曲几何对特征学习的优势。

Result: HAM的隐式偏差在多种任务（如视觉、图分类、大语言模型微调等）中显著提升了性能，尤其在稀疏化方法中表现优异。

Conclusion: HAM计算和内存开销小，适用于小批量训练，并能无缝集成到现有优化器中，是一种高效且通用的优化方法。

Abstract: Understanding the implicit bias of optimization algorithms has become central
to explaining the generalization behavior of deep learning models. For
instance, the hyperbolic implicit bias induced by the overparameterization $m
\odot w$--though effective in promoting sparsity--can result in a small
effective learning rate, which slows down convergence. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose HAM (Hyperbolic Aware Minimization), which alternates
between an optimizer step and a new hyperbolic mirror step. We derive the
Riemannian gradient flow for its combination with gradient descent, leading to
improved convergence and a similar beneficial hyperbolic geometry as $m \odot
w$ for feature learning. We provide an interpretation of the the algorithm by
relating it to natural gradient descent, and an exact characterization of its
implicit bias for underdetermined linear regression. HAM's implicit bias
consistently boosts performance--even of dense training, as we demonstrate in
experiments across diverse tasks, including vision, graph and node
classification, and large language model fine-tuning. HAM is especially
effective in combination with different sparsification methods, improving upon
the state of the art. The hyperbolic step requires minimal computational and
memory overhead, it succeeds even with small batch sizes, and its
implementation integrates smoothly with existing optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为确定性点估计，忽视未观测交通流的不确定性，且城市特定训练限制了模型的通用性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出TrafficPPT，融合实时观测、历史轨迹和路网拓扑数据，通过多城市模拟数据预训练和目标城市微调实现不确定性感知预测。

Result: 实验表明TrafficPPT在极端数据稀疏条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TrafficPPT通过概率建模和多城市预训练显著提升了交通流量预测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: City-scale traffic volume prediction plays a pivotal role in intelligent
transportation systems, yet remains a challenge due to the inherent
incompleteness and bias in observational data. Although deep learning-based
methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce
deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from
unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in
a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits
scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model
traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework
fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical
trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and
uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on
large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later
fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments
on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data
sparsity. Code will be open.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种场景下表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为版权内容提供了长期、鲁棒的保护方案。

Abstract: As AI advances, copyrighted content faces growing risk of unauthorized use,
whether through model training or direct misuse. Building upon invisible
adversarial perturbation, recent works developed copyright protections against
specific AI techniques such as unauthorized personalization through DreamBooth
that are misused. However, these methods offer only short-term security, as
they require retraining whenever the underlying model architectures change. To
establish long-term protection aiming at better robustness, we go beyond
invisible perturbation, and propose a universal approach that embeds
\textit{visible} watermarks that are \textit{hard-to-remove} into images.
Grounded in a new probabilistic and inverse problem-based formulation, our
framework maximizes the discrepancy between the \textit{optimal} reconstruction
and the original content. We develop an effective and efficient approximation
algorithm to circumvent a intractable bi-level optimization. Experimental
results demonstrate superiority of our approach across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有注意力机制可能无法充分捕捉时间序列数据中的非线性依赖关系，需要改进。

Method: 用Chatterjee秩相关系数替代标准注意力机制中的矩阵乘法，并引入可微分的SoftSort和SoftRank近似计算。

Result: 在真实数据集上，XicorAttention将预测精度提升约9.1%。

Conclusion: XicorAttention通过引入非线性相关性，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series
forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture
long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can
be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by
making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate
temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately
capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving
room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism
based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear
dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix
multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to
measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation
coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a
differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed
mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art
Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves
forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.

Conclusion: 方法论严谨性应优先于模型复杂性，研究对改进机器学习应用的研究实践具有警示意义。

Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud
detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow
algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper
evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve
deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are
violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current
approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences,
(2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal
validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall
optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a
minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many
sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite
fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation
methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The
study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede
architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research
practices across machine learning applications.

Result: 实验表明WARMPOT与现有方法竞争，且提出的权重优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的权重和算法WARMPOT在PDA中表现优异，为领域自适应提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: In many scenarios of practical interest, labeled data from a target
distribution are scarce while labeled data from a related source distribution
are abundant. One particular setting of interest arises when the target label
space is a subset of the source label space, leading to the framework of
partial domain adaptation (PDA). Typical approaches to PDA involve minimizing a
domain alignment term and a weighted empirical loss on the source data, with
the aim of transferring knowledge between domains. However, a theoretical basis
for this procedure is lacking, and in particular, most existing weighting
schemes are heuristic. In this work, we derive generalization bounds for the
PDA problem based on partial optimal transport. These bounds corroborate the
use of the partial Wasserstein distance as a domain alignment term, and lead to
theoretically motivated explicit expressions for the empirical source loss
weights. Inspired by these bounds, we devise a practical algorithm for PDA,
termed WARMPOT. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that WARMPOT
is competitive with recent approaches, and that our proposed weights improve on
existing schemes.

Result: 实验表明，MHGPO在多智能体LLM搜索系统中优于MAPPO，任务性能和计算效率均有提升，且无需预热。

Conclusion: MHGPO为复杂LLM-based MAS的稳定和可扩展优化提供了潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world
applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in
generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent
systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution,
enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing
these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and
limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent
policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL
algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on
Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase
computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical
Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group
Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy
updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of
rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability
and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group
rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and
effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate
that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and
computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential
for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.

Result: 实验表明WeightLoRA能显著减少参数数量，并在多个基准测试和模型上表现优于其他自适应方法。

Conclusion: WeightLoRA是一种高效且性能优越的参数微调方法。

Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is
inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as
low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to
selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it
requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers
to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the
most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a
result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while
maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values.
We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa,
BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of
$\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in
almost all cases.

Conclusion: 新正则化方法能有效减少过拟合，提升模型性能，适用于广泛的TDB模型。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be framed as a 3-order binary tensor
completion task. Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated
strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB
models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further
exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are
prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms
of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance.
Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that
addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models
and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of
intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the
predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a
theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the
predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to
verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the
reliability of our theoretical analysis. The code is available at

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection, which aims at identifying deviant samples, has
been crucial in a variety of real-world applications, such as medical disease
identification, financial fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, etc. Although
recent deep learning-based methods have achieved competitive performances,
these methods suffer from representation entanglement and the lack of global
correlation modeling, which hinders anomaly detection performance. To tackle
the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular
anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled
representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal
dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model
involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the
data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning
shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple
masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association
prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives
from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning
and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport
problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly
scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.

Conclusion: EB-MC-PILCO显著加速收敛，同时保持高效性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the slow policy optimization convergence of Monte Carlo
Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (MC-PILCO), a state-of-the-art
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm, by integrating it with
iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR), a fast trajectory optimization
method suitable for nonlinear systems. The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted
MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory
trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of
required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that
EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up
to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task
in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across
trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in
fewer iterations.

Abstract: Handling imbalanced target distributions in regression tasks remains a
significant challenge in tabular data settings where underrepresented regions
can hinder model performance. Among data-level solutions, some proposals, such
as random sampling and SMOTE-based approaches, propose adapting classification
techniques to regression tasks. However, these methods typically rely on crisp,
artificial thresholds over the target variable, a limitation inherited from
classification settings that can introduce arbitrariness, often leading to
non-intuitive and potentially misleading problem formulations. While recent
generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, provide flexible sample synthesis,
they come with high computational costs and limited interpretability. In this
study, we propose adapting an existing CART-based synthetic data generation
method, tailoring it for imbalanced regression. The new method integrates
relevance and density-based mechanisms to guide sampling in sparse regions of
the target space and employs a threshold-free, feature-driven generation
process. Our experimental study focuses on the prediction of extreme target
values across benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method
is competitive with other resampling and generative strategies in terms of
performance, while offering faster execution and greater transparency. These
results highlight the method's potential as a transparent, scalable data-level
strategy for improving regression models in imbalanced domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN无法有效表示方向性，而方向性在图形学习任务中至关重要。

Method: 提出定向蜂窝层和定向层拉普拉斯，构建了定向层神经网络（DSNN）。

Result: 在九个真实世界基准测试中，DSNN表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DSNN通过嵌入方向性显著提升了SNN的性能。

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a powerful generalization of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) that significantly improve our ability to model complex
relational data. While directionality has been shown to substantially boost
performance in graph learning tasks and is key to many real-world applications,
existing SNNs fall short in representing it. To address this limitation, we
introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf
designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this
structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which
captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This
operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN),
the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture.
Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmarks show that DSNN consistently
outperforms baseline methods.

Motivation: 当前策略优化方法在奖励归一化上存在不足，无法适应策略更新的动态性，导致梯度估计不稳定，影响训练稳定性。

Method: 提出Beta归一化策略优化（BNPO），利用动态更新的Beta分布参数自适应归一化奖励，并引入优势分解机制扩展其适用性。

Result: 实验证明BNPO在推理任务中达到了最先进的性能，理论分析表明其能降低梯度估计方差。

Conclusion: BNPO通过动态归一化奖励提升了训练稳定性，适用于复杂奖励系统，是现有方法的有效改进。

Abstract: Recent studies, including DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-k1.5, have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with rule-based, binary-valued reward functions can
significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
These models primarily utilize REINFORCE-based policy optimization techniques,
such as REINFORCE with baseline and group relative policy optimization (GRPO).
However, a key limitation remains: current policy optimization methods either
neglect reward normalization or employ static normalization strategies, which
fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of policy updates during training. This may
result in unstable gradient estimates and hinder training stability. To address
this issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel
policy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta
distribution with dynamically updated parameters. BNPO aligns the normalization
with the changing policy distribution, enabling more precise and lower-variance
gradient estimation, which in turn promotes stable training dynamics. We
provide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties
and show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward
settings. Furthermore, we introduce an advantage decomposition mechanism to
extend BNPO's applicability to more complex reward systems. Experimental
results confirm that BNPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among policy
optimization methods on reasoning tasks. The code is available at

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a learning mechanism that falls under the
distributed training umbrella, which collaboratively trains a shared global
model without disclosing the raw data from different clients. This paper
presents an extensive survey on the impact of partial client participation in
federated learning. While much of the existing research focuses on addressing
issues such as generalization, robustness, and fairness caused by data
heterogeneity under the assumption of full client participation, limited
attention has been given to the practical and theoretical challenges arising
from partial client participation, which is common in real-world scenarios.
This survey provides an in-depth review of existing FL methods designed to cope
with partial client participation. We offer a comprehensive analysis supported
by theoretical insights and empirical findings, along with a structured
categorization of these methods, highlighting their respective advantages and
disadvantages.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches -
utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in
improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training
recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE,
directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations
for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate
convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical
training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we
show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy
across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding
and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of
future large-scale models.

Conclusion: FCVR-BE算法通过动态聚类和方差优化，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，验证了其高效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model
training, yet its practical strength is often undermined by client data
heterogeneity, which severely degrades model performance. This paper proposes
that data heterogeneity across clients' distributions can be effectively
addressed by adopting an approach inspired by opinion dynamics over temporal
social networks. We introduce \shortname (Federated Coalition Variance
Reduction with Boltzmann Exploration), a variance-reducing selection algorithm
in which (1) clients dynamically organize into non-overlapping clusters based
on asymptotic agreements, and (2) from each cluster, one client is selected to
minimize the expected variance of its model update. Our experiments show that
in heterogeneous scenarios our algorithm outperforms existing FL algorithms,
yielding more accurate results and faster convergence, validating the efficacy
of our approach.

Conclusion: RAVEN-UCB在非静态环境中表现出色，理论和实际效果均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is challenging in non-stationary
environments where reward distributions evolve dynamically. We introduce
RAVEN-UCB, a novel algorithm that combines theoretical rigor with practical
efficiency via variance-aware adaptation. It achieves tighter regret bounds
than UCB1 and UCB-V, with gap-dependent regret of order $K \sigma_{\max}^2 \log
T / \Delta$ and gap-independent regret of order $\sqrt{K T \log T}$. RAVEN-UCB
incorporates three innovations: (1) variance-driven exploration using
$\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_k^2 / (N_k + 1)}$ in confidence bounds, (2) adaptive
control via $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / \log(t + \epsilon)$, and (3) constant-time
recursive updates for efficiency. Experiments across non-stationary patterns -
distributional changes, periodic shifts, and temporary fluctuations - in
synthetic and logistics scenarios demonstrate its superiority over
state-of-the-art baselines, confirming theoretical and practical robustness.

Result: 在6个已知和10个未知的VRP变体上，方法在1000节点规模下表现优异。

Conclusion: MTL-KD方法显著提升了模型的泛化能力，适用于多样化的VRP任务。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a
promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on
small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving
large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel
multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which
enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong
generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge
from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder
model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's
generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a
flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C),
which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the
performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10
unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method
consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world
benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

Method: 采用Point-Approximate Matrix Multiplication (PAMM)技术压缩Q、K、V投影的张量。

Result: 内存占用减少高达512倍，且模型困惑度表现相似或更好。

Conclusion: PAMM是一种实用且互补的方法，可与高效注意力技术（如FlashAttention）结合使用，实现内存高效的LLM训练。

Abstract: The Multi-Head Attention mechanism is central to LLM operation, and multiple
works target its compute and memory efficiency during training. While most
works focus on approximating the scaled dot product, the memory consumption of
the linear projections that compute the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ tensors from the
input $x$ is often overlooked. To address this, we propose Point-Approximate
Matrix Multiplication (PAMM), a novel tensor compression technique that reduces
memory consumption of the $Q,K,V$ projections in attention layers by a factor
of up to $\times 512$, effectively erasing their memory footprint, while
achieving similar or better final perplexity. PAMM is fully composable with
efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, making it a practical
and complementary method for memory-efficient LLM training.

Motivation: 由于语言模型代理的动作空间开放且难以定义，传统的令牌级反事实方法往往不适用，且容易产生偏见或无意义的结果。

Conclusion: 抽象反事实框架为语言模型代理的反事实推理提供了更有效的方法，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool for analysing and evaluating
autonomous agents, but its application to language model (LM) agents remains
challenging. Existing work on counterfactuals in LMs has primarily focused on
token-level counterfactuals, which are often inadequate for LM agents due to
their open-ended action spaces. Unlike traditional agents with fixed, clearly
defined action spaces, the actions of LM agents are often implicit in the
strings they output, making their action spaces difficult to define and
interpret. Furthermore, the meanings of individual tokens can shift depending
on the context, adding complexity to token-level reasoning and sometimes
leading to biased or meaningless counterfactuals. We introduce \emph{Abstract
Counterfactuals}, a framework that emphasises high-level characteristics of
actions and interactions within an environment, enabling counterfactual
reasoning tailored to user-relevant features. Our experiments demonstrate that
the approach produces consistent and meaningful counterfactuals while
minimising the undesired side effects of token-level methods. We conduct
experiments on text-based games and counterfactual text generation, while
considering both token-level and latent-space interventions.

Result: 在玩具和图像数据传输问题上展示了IFM的性能。

Conclusion: IFM成功解决了EFM中静电场的建模问题，并展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel
physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an
electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using
neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into
account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we
propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows
using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore,
inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we
design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems
which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance
on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Conclusion: PC-MoE打破了隐私保护与性能的权衡，实现了高效协作与强隐私保障。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful
adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce
Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages
the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized
collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory
and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could
achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data
privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the
forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE
synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong
confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay
for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that
trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and
sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized
model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against
reconstruction attacks.

Result: 仿真结果显示，2CEOAFL在性能上与未剪枝和未量化的低效算法相当。

Conclusion: 2CEOAFL算法在资源受限的ACV场景中实现了高效且性能可比的分布式学习。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected
vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately.
Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their
trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online
learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical
ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and
communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a
computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning
(2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited
onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned
ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories
according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose
a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense
ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c)
probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to
the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the
proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned
and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient
counterparts.

Abstract: Recent tabular Foundational Models (FM) such as TabPFN and TabICL, leverage
in-context learning to achieve strong performance without gradient updates or
fine-tuning. However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the
adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to
targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We
show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small,
structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction
accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate
that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to
conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent
to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification
problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the
context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context
adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with
adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach
improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these
findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial
threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation
practices in this emerging paradigm.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with neural networks benefits from very few
theoretical guarantees when it comes to the recovery guarantees. We provide in
this work convergence and recovery guarantees for self-supervised neural
networks applied to inverse problems, such as Deep Image/Inverse Prior, and
trained with inertia featuring both viscous and geometric Hessian-driven
dampings. We study both the continuous-time case, i.e., the trajectory of a
dynamical system, and the discrete case leading to an inertial algorithm with
an adaptive step-size. We show in the continuous-time case that the network can
be trained with an optimal accelerated exponential convergence rate compared to
the rate obtained with gradient flow. We also show that training a network with
our inertial algorithm enjoys similar recovery guarantees though with a less
sharp linear convergence rate.

Motivation: 逆折叠问题在生物技术应用中至关重要，但现有方法仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过结合折叠模型的反馈，优化逆折叠模型的性能。

Method: 使用DPO方法，通过采样候选序列并利用折叠模型生成结构偏好标签，对逆折叠模型进行微调。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过偏好优化提升蛋白质序列设计能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The inverse folding problem, aiming to design amino acid sequences that fold
into desired three-dimensional structures, is pivotal for various
biotechnological applications. Here, we introduce a novel approach leveraging
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune an inverse folding model
using feedback from a protein folding model. Given a target protein structure,
we begin by sampling candidate sequences from the inverse-folding model, then
predict the three-dimensional structure of each sequence with the folding model
to generate pairwise structural-preference labels. These labels are used to
fine-tune the inverse-folding model under the DPO objective. Our results on the
CATH 4.2 test set demonstrate that DPO fine-tuning not only improves sequence
recovery of baseline models but also leads to a significant improvement in
average TM-Score from 0.77 to 0.81, indicating enhanced structure similarity.
Furthermore, iterative application of our DPO-based method on challenging
protein structures yields substantial gains, with an average TM-Score increase
of 79.5\% with regard to the baseline model. This work establishes a promising
direction for enhancing protein sequence design ability from structure feedback
by effectively utilizing preference optimization.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainties for machine learning (ML) models is a foundational
challenge in modern data analysis. This challenge is compounded by at least two
key aspects of the field: (a) inconsistent terminology surrounding uncertainty
and estimation across disciplines, and (b) the varying technical requirements
for establishing trustworthy uncertainties in diverse problem contexts. In this
position paper, we aim to clarify the depth of these challenges by identifying
these inconsistencies and articulating how different contexts impose distinct
epistemic demands. We examine the current landscape of estimation targets
(e.g., prediction, inference, simulation-based inference), uncertainty
constructs (e.g., frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial), and the approaches used to
map between them. Drawing on the literature, we highlight and explain examples
of problematic mappings. To help address these issues, we advocate for
standards that promote alignment between the \textit{intent} and
\textit{implementation} of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. We
discuss several axes of trustworthiness that are necessary (if not sufficient)
for reliable UQ in ML models, and show how these axes can inform the design and
evaluation of uncertainty-aware ML systems. Our practical recommendations focus
on scientific ML, offering illustrative cases and use scenarios, particularly
in the context of simulation-based inference (SBI).

Abstract: We address the problem of Schr\"odinger potential estimation, which plays a
crucial role in modern generative modelling approaches based on Schr\"odinger
bridges and stochastic optimal control for SDEs. Given a simple prior diffusion
process, these methods search for a path between two given distributions
$\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ requiring minimal efforts. The optimal drift in this
case can be expressed through a Schr\"odinger potential. In the present paper,
we study generalization ability of an empirical Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk
minimizer over a class of admissible log-potentials aimed at fitting the
marginal distribution at time $T$. Under reasonable assumptions on the target
distribution $\rho_T^*$ and the prior process, we derive a non-asymptotic
high-probability upper bound on the KL-divergence between $\rho_T^*$ and the
terminal density corresponding to the estimated log-potential. In particular,
we show that the excess KL-risk may decrease as fast as $O(\log^2 n / n)$ when
the sample size $n$ tends to infinity even if both $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ have
unbounded supports.

Result: SHRVar实现了错误概率的指数级下降，数值实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂实验场景中表现出色，为多指标和异方差问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Standard A/B tests in online experiments face statistical power challenges
when testing multiple candidates simultaneously, while adaptive experimental
designs (AED) alone fall short in inferring experiment statistics such as the
average treatment effect, especially with many metrics (e.g., revenue, safety)
and heterogeneous variances. This paper proposes a fixed-budget multi-metric
AED framework with a two-phase structure: an adaptive exploration phase to
identify the best treatment, and a validation phase with an A/B test to verify
the treatment's quality and infer statistics. We propose SHRVar, which
generalizes sequential halving (SH) (Karnin et al., 2013) with a novel
relative-variance-based sampling and an elimination strategy built on reward
z-values. It achieves a provable error probability that decreases
exponentially, where the exponent generalizes the complexity measure for SH
(Karnin et al., 2013) and SHVar (Lalitha et al., 2023) with homogeneous and
heterogeneous variances, respectively. Numerical experiments verify our
analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of this new framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF算法假设链接函数已知（如逻辑函数），但人类偏好的复杂性使得这一假设不现实，因此需要研究链接函数未知的通用RLHF问题。

Method: 提出ZSPO算法，利用人类偏好构造与真实策略梯度方向正相关的参数更新方向，通过估计价值函数差异的符号而非梯度，无需知道链接函数。

Result: 在温和条件下，ZSPO以多项式收敛率收敛到平稳策略，数值结果展示了其在链接函数不匹配时的优越性。

Conclusion: ZSPO为链接函数未知的RLHF问题提供了有效解决方案，避免了误设问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from
the value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF
algorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in
empirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the
agent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which
is arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To
avoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems
with unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm
called ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the
key is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that
is positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves
it by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of
estimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not
require knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a
stationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of
policy iterations and trajectories per iteration. Numerical results also show
the superiority of ZSPO under link function mismatch.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of learning in the presence of an adversary that can
corrupt an $\eta$ fraction of the training examples with the goal of causing
failure on a specific test point. In the realizable setting, prior work
established that the optimal error under such instance-targeted poisoning
attacks scales as $\Theta(d\eta)$, where $d$ is the VC dimension of the
hypothesis class arXiv:2210.02713. In this work, we resolve the corresponding
question in the agnostic setting. We show that the optimal excess error is
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\eta})$, answering one of the main open problems left by
Hanneke et al. To achieve this rate, it is necessary to use randomized
learners: Hanneke et al. showed that deterministic learners can be forced to
suffer error close to 1, even under small amounts of poisoning. Perhaps
surprisingly, our upper bound remains valid even when the learner's random bits
are fully visible to the adversary . In the other direction, our lower bound is
stronger than standard PAC-style bounds: instead of tailoring a hard
distribution separately for each sample size, we exhibit a single fixed
distribution under which the adversary can enforce an excess error of
$\Omega(\sqrt{d\eta})$ infinitely often.

Motivation: 长序列训练语言模型时，存储激活值的内存成本过高，即使使用梯度检查点技术也难以解决。

Method: 提出StreamBP方法，通过序列维度的线性分解和利用语言模型的因果结构，减少内存占用和计算量。

Result: StreamBP将反向传播的最大序列长度扩展了2.8-5.5倍，同时保持或减少反向传播时间。

Conclusion: StreamBP是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种任务和多GPU训练，可轻松集成到现有训练流程中。

Abstract: Training language models on long sequence data is a demanding requirement for
enhancing the model's capability on complex tasks, e.g., long-chain reasoning.
However, as the sequence length scales up, the memory cost for storing
activation values becomes huge during the Backpropagation (BP) process, even
with the application of gradient checkpointing technique. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a memory-efficient and exact BP method called StreamBP,
which performs a linear decomposition of the chain rule along the sequence
dimension in a layer-wise manner, significantly reducing the memory cost of
activation values and logits. The proposed method is applicable to common
objectives such as SFT, GRPO, and DPO. From an implementation perspective,
StreamBP achieves less computational FLOPs and faster BP speed by leveraging
the causal structure of the language model. Compared to gradient checkpointing,
StreamBP scales up the maximum sequence length of BP by 2.8-5.5 times larger,
while using comparable or even less BP time. Note that StreamBP's sequence
length scaling ability can be directly transferred to batch size scaling for
accelerating training. We further develop a communication-efficient distributed
StreamBP to effectively support multi-GPU training and broaden its
applicability. Our code can be easily integrated into the training pipeline of
any transformer models and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/StreamBP.

Result: 证明了确定性有限自动机的长度复杂度为2n-2，上下文无关文法无计算上界，C-RASP函数类的长度复杂度为多项式级别。

Conclusion: 长度泛化的可行性取决于函数类的语言等价问题的可判定性，C-RASP函数类在多项式复杂度内可实现长度泛化。

Abstract: Length generalization is the ability of a learning algorithm to learn a
hypothesis which generalizes to longer inputs than the inputs in the training
set. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees of length generalization for
various classes of functions in an idealized setting. First, we formalize the
framework of non-asymptotic length generalization, which requires a computable
upper bound for the minimum input length that guarantees length generalization,
as a function of the complexity of ground-truth function under some given
complexity measure. We refer to this minimum input length to length generalize
as length complexity. We show the Minimum-Complexity Interpolator learning
algorithm achieves optimal length complexity. We further show that whether a
function class admits non-asymptotic length generalization is equivalent to the
decidability of its language equivalence problem, which implies that there is
no computable upper bound for the length complexity of Context-Free Grammars.
On the positive side, we show that the length complexity of Deterministic
Finite Automata is $2n - 2$ where $n$ is the number of states of the
ground-truth automaton. Our main results are upper bounds of length complexity
for a subset of a transformer-related function class called C-RASP (Yang &
Chiang, 2024). We show that the length complexity of 1-layer C-RASP functions
is $O(T^2)$ when the ground-truth function has precision $T$, and that the
length complexity of 2-layer C-RASP functions is $O(T^{O(K)})$ when the
ground-truth function has precision $T$ and $K$ heads.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for analyzing
graph-structured data in domains such as drug discovery and financial analysis,
leading to growing demands for model transparency. Recent advances in
explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that
influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently
expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations
potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model
stealing. We propose {\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates
explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data
augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective
replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns
of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our
approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This
work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of
explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective
measures against explanation-based attacks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode
abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately
orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in
interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model
representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing
signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This
raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds
with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help
identify said features and gain further insights into neural network
representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based
approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from
sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a
sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and
nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs
on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical
concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are
unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE
recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the
seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a
vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features
are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the
sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of
adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest.
Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that
interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with
methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in
recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its
theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose
the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear
regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the
retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the
classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our
analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on
RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model
retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing
uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample
efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks,
such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
stimulating the capabilities of strong pre-trained models by leveraging
supervision from weaker supervisors. To improve the performance of the strong
model, existing methods often require additional weak models or complex
procedures, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. Motivated
by the effectiveness of $f$-divergence loss in various machine learning
domains, we introduce $f$-divergence as an information-theoretic loss function
framework in W2SG. Our theoretical analysis reveals fundamental limitations and
equivalence of different $f$-divergence losses in W2SG, supported by sample
complexity bounds and information-theoretic insights. We empirically
demonstrate that $f$-divergence loss, which generalizes widely-used metrics
like KL divergence, effectively improves generalization and noise tolerance of
the strong model in practice.

Result: 在实验中，整流流仅需8步即可达到与标准扩散模型（128步以上）相同的后验分布，同时保留细粒度特征。

Conclusion: 整流流在保持高分辨率样本的同时，大幅缩短了推理时间，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The statistical modeling of fluid flows is very challenging due to their
multiscale dynamics and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. While
recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they
typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We
introduce a rectified flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity
field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight
trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step
much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps
in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity.
Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows
recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve
fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver
high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.

allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar
decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices
constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory
shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical
low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian
optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing
general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem
solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.

*Xiangyu Zhou,Yao Qiang,Saleh Zare Zade,Douglas Zytko,Prashant Khanduri,Dongxiao Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLMs）的定向信息遗忘（TIF）框架，通过区分不需要的单词（UW）和通用单词（GW），优化遗忘过程，减少模型效用损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在预训练过程中可能记忆隐私或受版权保护的内容，现有遗忘方法存在过度遗忘问题，导致模型效用下降。

Method: TIF框架包括：1）定向信息标识器区分UW和GW；2）基于Logit Preference Loss和Preservation Loss的定向偏好优化方法。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，TIF框架显著提升了遗忘效果，同时保持了模型效用，取得了最优结果。

Conclusion: TIF框架有效解决了LLMs的定向信息遗忘问题，平衡了遗忘效果与模型效用的关系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive text corpora, exhibit
remarkable human-level language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making
abilities. However, they tend to memorize unwanted information, such as private
or copyrighted content, raising significant privacy and legal concerns.
Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, but existing methods face a
significant challenge of over-forgetting. This issue arises because they
indiscriminately suppress the generation of all the tokens in forget samples,
leading to a substantial loss of model utility. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce the Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) framework, which consists
of (1) a flexible targeted information identifier designed to differentiate
between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) in the forget samples, and
(2) a novel Targeted Preference Optimization approach that leverages Logit
Preference Loss to unlearn unwanted information associated with UW and
Preservation Loss to retain general information in GW, effectively improving
the unlearning process while mitigating utility degradation. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TIF
framework enhances unlearning effectiveness while preserving model utility and
achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需参考数据的算法（No-Data Algorithm），通过连续挑战评估者来验证其可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有标注参考数据的情况下，无法通过测试或假设验证评估者的可信度，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 提出No-Data Algorithm，通过连续挑战评估者来验证其可信度。

Result: 证明该算法能以高概率验证可信度，正确接受可信评估者并标记不可信评估者。

Conclusion: No-Data Algorithm为无参考数据下的评估者可信度验证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure
its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are
either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to
label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are
unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data,
and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an
algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator
without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing
challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish
trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows
the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and,
conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it.
We present formal proofs of correctness and limited experiments.

*Saurabh Agrawal,Raj Gohil,Gopal Kumar Agrawal,Vikram C M,Kushal Verma*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SALF-MOS的新模型，用于预测语音合成的MOS评分，解决了传统主观评分耗时和客观评分不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音质量评估在TTS或语音转换模型选择中至关重要，但现有客观指标不可靠，主观评分耗时。

Method: 使用卷积序列堆叠提取音频样本的潜在特征，构建小型、端到端、可扩展的SALF-MOS模型。

Result: 基于MSE、LCC、SRCC和KTAU等指标，模型取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: SALF-MOS是一种高效且可靠的语音质量评估方法。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment is a critical process in selecting text-to-speech
synthesis (TTS) or voice conversion models. Evaluation of voice synthesis can
be done using objective metrics or subjective metrics. Although there are many
objective metrics like the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ),
Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) or Short-Time
Objective Intelligibility (STOI) but none of them is feasible in selecting the
best model. On the other hand subjective metric like Mean Opinion Score is
highly reliable but it requires a lot of manual efforts and are time-consuming.
To counter the issues in MOS Evaluation, we have developed a novel model,
Speaker Agnostic Latent Features (SALF)-Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a
small-sized, end-to-end, highly generalized and scalable model for predicting
MOS score on a scale of 5. We use the sequences of convolutions and stack them
to get the latent features of the audio samples to get the best
state-of-the-art results based on mean squared error (MSE), Linear Concordance
Correlation coefficient (LCC), Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and
Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (KTAU).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的解耦学习策略，通过前缀调优的交叉注意力分离语音和语言信息，显著提高了多语言环境下的说话人识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言环境下，说话人嵌入中的语言信息与说话人信息相互纠缠，导致识别准确性下降，需要一种方法分离这两种信息。

Method: 采用联合学习策略，结合前缀调优的交叉注意力机制，有效处理说话人在不同语言间切换的情况。

Result: 模型在单语言和多语言环境下均表现良好，包括未见过的语言，显著降低了等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功分离了语言和说话人信息，提升了多语言环境下的说话人识别性能。

Abstract: Speaker recognition models face challenges in multi-lingual settings due to
the entanglement of linguistic information within speaker embeddings. The
overlap between vocal traits such as accent, vocal anatomy, and a language's
phonetic structure complicates separating linguistic and speaker information.
Disentangling these components can significantly improve speaker recognition
accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel disentanglement learning strategy
that integrates joint learning through prefix-tuned cross-attention. This
approach is particularly effective when speakers switch between languages.
Experimental results show the model generalizes across monolingual and
multi-lingual settings, including unseen languages. Notably, the proposed model
improves the equal error rate across multiple datasets, highlighting its
ability to separate language information from speaker embeddings and enhance
recognition in diverse linguistic conditions.

Method: 结合深度度量多类N对损失、Real Emphasis和Fake Dispersion框架、Conformer分类网络以及集成分数-嵌入融合。

Result: 在源追踪任务中表现出优于基线系统的性能，并通过Frechet距离和标准指标验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在区分真实与伪造语音模式及源追踪任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced
AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed
speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a
novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss
with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification
network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves
discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance
robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The
Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio
signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding
fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source
tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard
metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline
system.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has seen significant progress with deep

scarcity of annotated data. In this work, we explore unsupervised learning to
improve SER in low-resource settings. Specifically, we investigate contrastive

approaches to enhance cross-lingual generalization. Our methods achieve notable
F1 score improvements of 10.6% in Urdu, 15.2% in German, and 13.9% in Bangla,
demonstrating their effectiveness in LRLs. Additionally, we analyze model
behavior to provide insights on key factors influencing performance across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AVSR模型在理想化场景中表现良好，但忽视了真实场景中说话和沉默面部片段的复杂性，因此需要更贴近现实的数据集和方法。

Method: 引入了一个新的音频-视觉鸡尾酒会数据集，包含说话和沉默面部片段，并开发了一种无需显式分割线索的方法。

Result: 在极端噪声环境下，WER从119%降至39.2%，相对降低了67%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AVSR系统在复杂噪声环境中的性能，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) offers a robust solution for speech
recognition in challenging environments, such as cocktail-party scenarios,
where relying solely on audio proves insufficient. However, current AVSR models
are often optimized for idealized scenarios with consistently active speakers,
overlooking the complexities of real-world settings that include both speaking
and silent facial segments. This study addresses this gap by introducing a
novel audio-visual cocktail-party dataset designed to benchmark current AVSR
systems and highlight the limitations of prior approaches in realistic noisy
conditions. Additionally, we contribute a 1526-hour AVSR dataset comprising
both talking-face and silent-face segments, enabling significant performance
gains in cocktail-party environments. Our approach reduces WER by 67% relative
to the state-of-the-art, reducing WER from 119% to 39.2% in extreme noise,
without relying on explicit segmentation cues.

Conclusion: OCDGALP方法在说话人日志任务中表现优异，显著优于传统聚类方法。

Abstract: In speaker diarization, traditional clustering-based methods remain widely
used in real-world applications. However, these methods struggle with the
complex distribution of speaker embeddings and overlapping speech segments. To
address these limitations, we propose an Overlapping Community Detection method
based on Graph Attention networks and the Label Propagation Algorithm
(OCDGALP). The proposed framework comprises two key components: (1) a graph
attention network that refines speaker embeddings and node connections by
aggregating information from neighboring nodes, and (2) a label propagation
algorithm that assigns multiple community labels to each node, enabling
simultaneous clustering and overlapping community detection. Experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the Diarization
Error Rate (DER), achieving a state-of-the-art 15.94% DER on the DIHARD-III
dataset without oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and an impressive 11.07%
with oracle VAD.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Source Separation (LASS) enables open-vocabulary sound
separation via natural language queries. While existing methods rely on
task-specific training, we explore whether pretrained diffusion models,
originally designed for audio generation, can inherently perform separation
without further training. In this study, we introduce a training-free framework
leveraging generative priors for zero-shot LASS. Analyzing na\"ive adaptations,
we identify key limitations arising from modality-specific challenges.To
address these issues, we propose Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a
test-time optimization framework that refines spectrogram masks for precise,
input-aligned separation. Our approach effectively repurposes pretrained
diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance
without task-specific supervision. This work expands the application of
diffusion models beyond generation, establishing a new paradigm for zero-shot
audio separation. The code is available at: https://wltschmrz.github.io/DGMO/

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功克服了小样本数据的局限性，保留了系统的完整动态复杂性，同时利用了降维几何表示。

Abstract: We present a generative learning framework for probabilistic sampling based
on an extension of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM) approach,
which is designed to generate statistically consistent realizations of a random
vector in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, informed by a limited (yet
representative) set of observations. In its original form, PLoM constructs a
reduced-order probabilistic model by combining three main components: (a)
kernel density estimation to approximate the underlying probability measure,
(b) Diffusion Maps to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold structure,
and (c) a reduced-order Ito Stochastic Differential Equation (ISDE) to sample
from the learned distribution. A key challenge arises, however, when the number
of available data points N is small and the dimensionality of the diffusion-map
basis approaches N, resulting in overfitting and loss of generalization. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an enabling extension that implements a
synthesis of Double Diffusion Maps -- a technique capable of capturing
multiscale geometric features of the data -- with Geometric Harmonics (GH), a
nonparametric reconstruction method that allows smooth nonlinear interpolation
in high-dimensional ambient spaces. This approach enables us to solve a
full-order ISDE directly in the latent space, preserving the full dynamical
complexity of the system, while leveraging its reduced geometric
representation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are
illustrated through two numerical studies: one based on data generated from
two-dimensional Hermite polynomial functions and another based on high-fidelity
simulations of a detonation wave in a reactive flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有排名理论通常假设数据分离条件，但实际数据中常存在分数相近的项目，导致排名对噪声敏感。

Method: 提出了两种排名操作符：膨胀top-k和膨胀全排名，允许输出中表达不确定性以提高稳定性。

Result: 实验证明，新方法在不牺牲信息量的前提下提供了稳定性，且不依赖数据分布或候选数量。

Conclusion: 新方法填补了现有理论的空白，适用于实际数据中的排名问题。

Abstract: In this work, we consider ranking problems among a finite set of candidates:
for instance, selecting the top-$k$ items among a larger list of candidates or
obtaining the full ranking of all items in the set. These problems are often
unstable, in the sense that estimating a ranking from noisy data can exhibit
high sensitivity to small perturbations. Concretely, if we use data to provide
a score for each item (say, by aggregating preference data over a sample of
users), then for two items with similar scores, small fluctuations in the data
can alter the relative ranking of those items. Many existing theoretical
results for ranking problems assume a separation condition to avoid this
challenge, but real-world data often contains items whose scores are
approximately tied, limiting the applicability of existing theory. To address
this gap, we develop a new algorithmic stability framework for ranking
problems, and propose two novel ranking operators for achieving stable ranking:
the \emph{inflated top-$k$} for the top-$k$ selection problem and the
\emph{inflated full ranking} for ranking the full list. To enable stability,
each method allows for expressing some uncertainty in the output. For both of
these two problems, our proposed methods provide guaranteed stability, with no
assumptions on data distributions and no dependence on the total number of
candidates to be ranked. Experiments on real-world data confirm that the
proposed methods offer stability without compromising the informativeness of
the output.

Motivation: 数字健康技术生成的多模态数据潜力巨大，但现有方法依赖监督学习，需要大量标注数据，成本高且不切实际。

Method: 提出MoCA框架，结合跨模态掩码和Transformer自编码器，利用模态内时间相关性和跨模态相关性。

Result: 实验表明，MoCA在重建和下游任务中优于现有方法，并提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: MoCA展示了自监督学习在数字健康和多模态数据中的变革潜力。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the
generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements
simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices.
These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current
methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled
datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in
clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised
learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that
leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture
to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal
correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to
support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA.
Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We
release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream
tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for
$\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data.
Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the
optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition
number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize --
for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by
large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable
distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps
to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the
local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in
special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from
convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with
finite minimizers.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉动态多层网络的时空动态，因此需要一种新方法来更准确地描述这些复杂交互。

Method: 使用对称Tucker分解表示潜在节点特征及其交互模式，并通过变分期望最大化算法进行模型推断。

Result: 数值模拟和案例研究表明TSSDMN能有效理解动态多层网络。

Conclusion: TSSDMN为动态多层网络的建模提供了一种高效且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is
critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often
fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper
introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks
(TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric
Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction
patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and
allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures
both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model
identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as
variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field
variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization
algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and
case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic
multilayer networks.

Conclusion: 为理解序列结构如何促进基于注意力的模型学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a class of
sequence models termed Sequence Single-Index (SSI) models, where the target
depends on a single direction in input space applied to a sequence of tokens.
This setting generalizes classical single-index models to the sequential
domain, encompassing simplified one-layer attention architectures. We derive a
closed-form expression for the population loss in terms of a pair of sufficient
statistics capturing semantic and positional alignment, and characterize the
induced high-dimensional SGD dynamics for these coordinates. Our analysis
reveals two distinct training phases: escape from uninformative initialization
and alignment with the target subspace, and demonstrates how the sequence
length and positional encoding influence convergence speed and learning
trajectories. These results provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
understanding how sequential structure in data can be beneficial for learning
with attention-based models.

Conclusion: 结构相关性和学习顺序在多模态高维推理中至关重要，顺序课程学习策略是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy,
correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common
low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor
models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and
surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is
typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the
matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing,
inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network
phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails:
the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint
optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations
of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum
Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide
tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery
thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the
critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal
high-dimensional inference.

Result: 实验表明SA-GFN能实现无偏采样，提升多样性，并生成与目标分布匹配的高奖励图。

Conclusion: SA-GFN通过奖励结构调整有效解决了对称性偏差问题，提升了图生成性能。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling
graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from
systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability
computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact
both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that
incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward
scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure,
SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations.
Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing
diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the
target distribution.

Abstract: We address the problem of safely learning controlled stochastic dynamics from
discrete-time trajectory observations, ensuring system trajectories remain
within predefined safe regions during both training and deployment.
Safety-critical constraints of this kind are crucial in applications such as
autonomous robotics, finance, and biomedicine. We introduce a method that
ensures safe exploration and efficient estimation of system dynamics by
iteratively expanding an initial known safe control set using kernel-based
confidence bounds. After training, the learned model enables predictions of the
system's dynamics and permits safety verification of any given control. Our
approach requires only mild smoothness assumptions and access to an initial
safe control set, enabling broad applicability to complex real-world systems.
We provide theoretical guarantees for safety and derive adaptive learning rates
that improve with increasing Sobolev regularity of the true dynamics.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method
in terms of safety, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CPME框架在数值模拟中表现出优于现有方法的实际优势。

Abstract: Estimating the distribution of outcomes under counterfactual policies is
critical for decision-making in domains such as recommendation, advertising,
and healthcare. We analyze a novel framework-Counterfactual Policy Mean
Embedding (CPME)-that represents the entire counterfactual outcome distribution
in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling flexible and
nonparametric distributional off-policy evaluation. We introduce both a plug-in
estimator and a doubly robust estimator; the latter enjoys improved uniform
convergence rates by correcting for bias in both the outcome embedding and
propensity models. Building on this, we develop a doubly robust kernel test
statistic for hypothesis testing, which achieves asymptotic normality and thus
enables computationally efficient testing and straightforward construction of
confidence intervals. Our framework also supports sampling from the
counterfactual distribution. Numerical simulations illustrate the practical
benefits of CPME over existing methods.

Conclusion: OmniMatch在多图匹配和测试中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the
setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that
under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently
perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha<2\wedge d/4$
-- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and
in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing
setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices
across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for
misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power.
We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from
connectomics and machine translation.

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法在不同非平稳性度量下均表现出色，为Bandit凸优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Bandit Convex Optimization is a fundamental class of sequential
decision-making problems, where the learner selects actions from a continuous
domain and observes a loss (but not its gradient) at only one point per round.
We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the
regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of
switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\Delta$ of the
loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose
a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with
Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from
online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses,
we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$
by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the
Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with
unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a
second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on
exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time
computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known
$S$ and $\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.

Abstract: The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is
explained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the
predictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal
relationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart
failure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of
important variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent
regression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the
cause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a
new computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and
score the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary)
clinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we
investigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature
types: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal
features. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal
relationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature
importance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees)
strongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without
differentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal
for HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can
be used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based
prediction modeling.

Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized
low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it
employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix
Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds,
surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and
reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key
technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link
function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local*
minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise
optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications
include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a
state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a
novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our
analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new,
potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda
regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).

Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring
their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature
of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling
dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an
automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web
application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the
system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and
generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle
conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions
include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site
navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating
form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating
form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of

Abstract: In recent years, code intelligence has gained increasing importance in the
field of automated software engineering. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of
Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised
concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model
performance evaluation. This paper presents a systematic empirical study to
investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our
study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs,
namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code
generation, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into
four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only,
output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct
corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.
  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and
inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired
contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But
direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.
In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly
affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination
scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the
conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance
overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of
code intelligence models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源的预训练模型资源缺乏针对软件工程需求的分类，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过HF API系统收集PTMs数据，结合模型卡描述、元数据和arXiv论文摘要，经过多步过滤（如异常检测、去重和使用Gemini 2.0 Flash验证）确认SE相关性。

Result: 筛选出2,205个SE相关的PTMs，代码生成是最常见的任务，需求工程和软件设计任务较少；文本生成在SE PTMs中占主导地位。

Conclusion: 该分类法为未来自动化SE场景（如PTMs的采样和选择）提供了基础。

Abstract: Open-Source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various
Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored
to Software Engineering (SE) needs. To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy
encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a
popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Our repository mining
study began with a systematically gathered database of PTMs from the HF API,
considering their model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstract of the
associated arXiv papers. We confirmed SE relevance through multiple filtering
steps: detecting outliers, identifying near-identical PTMs, and the use of
Gemini 2.0 Flash, which was validated with five pilot studies involving three
human annotators. This approach uncovered 2,205 SE PTMs. We find that code
generation is the most common SE task among PTMs, primarily focusing on
software implementation, while requirements engineering and software design
activities receive limited attention. In terms of ML tasks, text generation
dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly
since 2023 Q2. Our classification provides a solid foundation for future
automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

TL;DR: PhysGaia是一个专为动态新视角合成（DyNVS）设计的物理感知数据集，包含结构化对象和非结构化物理现象，支持复杂的动态场景建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注逼真重建，缺乏对物理感知动态场景建模的支持，PhysGaia填补了这一空白。

Method: 数据集通过精心选择的物理求解器生成严格遵循物理规律的场景，并提供3D粒子轨迹和物理参数等真实数据。

Result: PhysGaia支持定量评估物理建模，并提供了与先进DyNVS模型的集成管道和结果报告。

Conclusion: PhysGaia将推动动态视角合成、物理场景理解和深度学习与物理模拟结合的研究，实现更真实的复杂动态场景重建。

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed
for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects
and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily
focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support
physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic
scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they
realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it
contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas,
viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies
prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated
to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected
material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of
physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information,
including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To
facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines
for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their
results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware
modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view
synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models
integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful
reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and
codes are available in the project website,

### [310] [Surgical Foundation Model Leveraging Compression and Entropy Maximization for Image-Guided Surgical Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01980)
*Lianhao Yin,Ozanan Meireles,Guy Rosman,Daniela Rus*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Compress-to-Explore (C2E)的自监督框架，利用Kolmogorov复杂度从手术视频中学习紧凑且信息丰富的表示，无需标注数据即可提升编码器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注成本高昂，医学领域缺乏大规模标注数据集，而现有自监督方法难以捕捉通用的结构和物理信息。

Method: C2E框架通过熵最大化解码器压缩图像，同时保留临床相关细节，从而学习紧凑表示。

Result: C2E在多种手术ML任务（如工作流分类、工具-组织交互分类、分割和诊断）中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: C2E展示了自监督学习在提升手术AI性能和改善微创手术结果方面的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally
invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large,
annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are
prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can
address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture
structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We
propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that
leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations
from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images
while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance
without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E
demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such
as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification,
segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical
visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal
compact representation better disentangles features from different structural
parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet
untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and
improve outcomes in MIS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PFGM++的新型CT重建框架FORCE，解决了数据不一致性和模型不稳定问题，在多种任务中表现优于现有无监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床CT场景中，低剂量、稀疏扫描和金属植入物等问题导致重建图像噪声和伪影严重，而深度学习训练数据的获取困难且存在数据不一致风险。

Method: 结合数据保真度和PFGM++生成模型，提出FORCE框架。

Result: 实验表明，FORCE在多种CT任务中表现优于现有无监督方法。

Conclusion: FORCE框架有效解决了CT重建中的数据不一致问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a major medical imaging modality. Clinical CT
scenarios, such as low-dose screening, sparse-view scanning, and metal
implants, often lead to severe noise and artifacts in reconstructed images,
requiring improved reconstruction techniques. The introduction of deep learning
has significantly advanced CT image reconstruction. However, obtaining paired
training data remains rather challenging due to patient motion and other
constraints. Although deep learning methods can still perform well with
approximately paired data, they inherently carry the risk of hallucination due
to data inconsistencies and model instability. In this paper, we integrate the
data fidelity with the state-of-the-art generative AI model, referred to as the
Poisson flow generative model (PFGM) with a generalized version PFGM++, and
propose a novel CT framework: Flow-Oriented Reconstruction Conditioning Engine
(FORCE). In our experiments, the proposed method shows superior performance in
various CT imaging tasks, outperforming existing unsupervised reconstruction
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因子图消息传递的多变量自回归模型递归贝叶斯估计方法，能够生成自回归系数和噪声精度的完整后验分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统递归最小二乘法无法提供完整的后验分布，而该方法能够量化估计和预测的不确定性，并支持在线模型证据计算。

Method: 基于因子图的消息传递方法，递归估计多变量自回归模型的外生输入参数。

Result: 在合成自回归系统和双质量-弹簧-阻尼系统上验证了方法的收敛性和竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了更全面的不确定性量化，还在实际系统中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for multivariate
autoregressive models with exogenous inputs based on message passing in a
factor graph. Unlike recursive least-squares, our method produces full
posterior distributions for both the autoregressive coefficients and noise
precision. The uncertainties regarding these estimates propagate into the
uncertainties on predictions for future system outputs, and support online
model evidence calculations. We demonstrate convergence empirically on a
synthetic autoregressive system and competitive performance on a double
mass-spring-damper system.

*András Strausz,Niels Pardon,Ioana Giurgiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨引擎优化器，通过学习的成本模型自动选择适合执行SQL查询的引擎，减少了人工干预和错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lakehouse系统中，为SQL查询选择最佳执行引擎需要先验知识和手动操作，复杂且难以扩展。

Method: 使用多任务学习的成本模型，基于查询计划和提示进行成本预测和路由，支持灵活添加新引擎。

Result: 优化后的逻辑计划降低了Q-error 12.6%，跨引擎优化器在零样本和少样本设置下分别减少了25.2%和30.4%的总运行时间。

Conclusion: 跨引擎优化器显著提高了查询性能和效率，适用于多引擎环境。

Abstract: Lakehouse systems enable the same data to be queried with multiple execution
engines. However, selecting the engine best suited to run a SQL query still
requires a priori knowledge of the query computational requirements and an
engine capability, a complex and manual task that only becomes more difficult
with the emergence of new engines and workloads. In this paper, we address this
limitation by proposing a cross-engine optimizer that can automate engine
selection for diverse SQL queries through a learned cost model. Optimized with
hints, a query plan is used for query cost prediction and routing. Cost
prediction is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, and multiple
predictor heads, corresponding to different engines and provisionings, are used
in the model architecture. This eliminates the need to train engine-specific
models and allows the flexible addition of new engines at a minimal fine-tuning
cost. Results on various databases and engines show that using a query
optimized logical plan for cost estimation decreases the average Q-error by
even 12.6% over using unoptimized plans as input. Moreover, the proposed
cross-engine optimizer reduces the total workload runtime by up to 25.2% in a
zero-shot setting and 30.4% in a few-shot setting when compared to random
routing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LSTM和BEKK模型的新框架LSTM-BEKK，用于改进多变量波动率建模，特别适用于金融数据中的非线性动态依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多变量GARCH方法在捕捉持续波动聚类和资产间不对称联动方面存在局限，需要更灵活的模型。

Method: 结合LSTM的灵活性和BEKK模型的计量结构，构建LSTM-BEKK框架，以捕捉非线性动态依赖。

Result: 实证表明，LSTM-BEKK在多市场数据中表现优异，尤其在样本外投资组合风险预测方面。

Conclusion: 混合计量-深度学习模型在金融风险管理和波动率预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multivariate volatility modeling framework,
named Long Short-Term Memory enhanced BEKK (LSTM-BEKK), that integrates deep
learning into multivariate GARCH processes. By combining the flexibility of
recurrent neural networks with the econometric structure of BEKK models, our
approach is designed to better capture nonlinear, dynamic, and high-dimensional
dependence structures in financial return data. The proposed model addresses
key limitations of traditional multivariate GARCH-based methods, particularly
in capturing persistent volatility clustering and asymmetric co-movement across
assets. Leveraging the data-driven nature of LSTMs, the framework adapts
effectively to time-varying market conditions, offering improved robustness and
forecasting performance. Empirical results across multiple equity markets
confirm that the LSTM-BEKK model achieves superior performance in terms of
out-of-sample portfolio risk forecast, while maintaining the interpretability
from the BEKK models. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid
econometric-deep learning models in advancing financial risk management and
multivariate volatility forecasting.

*Hui Liu,Shiye Tian,Xuejun Liu*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: SmilesGEN是一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的新型生成模型，用于生成具有潜在治疗效果的分子。它通过整合药物VAE和表达谱VAE，在共同潜在空间中建模药物扰动与转录响应的相互作用，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖表达谱指导分子生成，但忽略了分子对细胞环境的扰动效应。SmilesGEN旨在克服这一限制。

Method: SmilesGEN整合了预训练的药物VAE（SmilesNet）和表达谱VAE（ProfileNet），在潜在空间中共同建模药物扰动与转录响应的关系。ProfileNet消除药物扰动以重建预处理表达谱，而SmilesNet根据目标表达谱生成分子。

Result: 实验表明，SmilesGEN在生成分子的有效性、独特性、新颖性以及与已知配体的相似性方面优于现有模型，并在支架优化和治疗剂生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: SmilesGEN提供了一个强大框架，利用基因特征生成具有诱导理想细胞表型变化潜力的药物样分子。

Abstract: The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable
phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods
predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but
overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To
overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based
on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with
potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE
(SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the
interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common
latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment
expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent
space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate
drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN
outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher
degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity
to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate
SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of
therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating
molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a
robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules
that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质应用基准缺乏对工业相关任务的覆盖，且对领域特定模型和预训练策略的系统性比较不足。

Method: Protap设计了五个蛋白质应用任务，包括三个通用任务和两个新颖的专业任务，比较了不同架构、预训练策略和领域特定模型。

Result: 大规模预训练编码器在小数据集上表现不佳；结构信息在微调中表现优异；领域先验知识提升专业任务性能。

Conclusion: Protap为蛋白质应用提供了全面的基准测试，强调了监督学习、结构信息和领域知识的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies
have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally,
domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed
to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce
$\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares
backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models
across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically,
Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized
tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted
protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing
benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific
models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our
empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders
achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on
small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information
during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language
models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific
biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to the condition
monitoring of vehicular equipment, aiming to enhance maintenance strategies,
reduce costs, and improve safety. Leveraging the edge computing paradigm,
AI-based condition monitoring systems process vast streams of vehicular data to
detect anomalies and optimize operational performance. In this work, we
introduce a novel vehicle condition monitoring service that enables real-time
diagnostics of a diverse set of anomalies while remaining practical for
deployment in real-world edge environments. To address mobility challenges, we
propose a closed-loop service orchestration framework where service migration
across edge nodes is dynamically triggered by network-related metrics. Our
approach has been implemented and tested in a real-world race circuit
environment equipped with 5G network capabilities under diverse operational
conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
in ensuring low-latency AI inference and adaptive service placement,
highlighting its potential for intelligent transportation and mobility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ULIs在AI时代存在系统性隐私风险，传统保护措施已不足。

Method: 提出基于密码学的身份系统框架，满足AI时代需求并兼容现有工作流程。

Result: 设计保留了机构工作流程，支持审计和委托等功能，并提供了迁移路径。

Conclusion: ULIs已不适应AI时代，新框架为替代方案提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Many identity systems assign a single, static identifier to an individual for
life, reused across domains like healthcare, finance, and education. These
Universal Lifelong Identifiers (ULIs) underpin critical workflows but now pose
systemic privacy risks. We take the position that ULIs are fundamentally
incompatible with the AI era and must be phased out. We articulate a threat
model grounded in modern AI capabilities and show that traditional safeguards
such as redaction, consent, and access controls are no longer sufficient. We
define core properties for identity systems in the AI era and present a
cryptographic framework that satisfies them while retaining compatibility with
existing identifier workflows. Our design preserves institutional workflows,
supports essential functions such as auditability and delegation, and offers a
practical migration path beyond ULIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLOps的广泛应用，其统一性带来了安全漏洞，亟需系统性防护。

Method: 使用MITRE ATLAS框架分析MLOps各阶段的攻击，并提出分类和缓解策略。

Result: 提出了攻击分类和防御策略，强调早期防护的重要性。

Conclusion: MLOps安全需从初始阶段加强，以应对不断演变的网络攻击。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has driven
organizations across diverse sectors to seek efficient and reliable methods to
accelerate model development-to-deployment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
has emerged as an integrative approach addressing these requirements by
unifying relevant roles and streamlining ML workflows. As the MLOps market
continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly critical.
However, the unified nature of MLOps ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities,
making them susceptible to adversarial attacks where a single misconfiguration
can lead to compromised credentials, severe financial losses, damaged public
trust, and the poisoning of training data. Our paper presents a systematic
application of the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for
Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework, a comprehensive and continuously
updated catalog of AI-focused attacks, to systematically assess attacks across
different phases of the MLOps ecosystem. We begin by examining the preparatory
phases during which adversaries acquire the essential intelligence required to
initiate their attacks. We then present a structured taxonomy of attack
techniques explicitly mapped to corresponding phases of the MLOps ecosystem,
supported by examples drawn from red-teaming exercises and real-world
incidents. This is followed by a taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with
these attack categories, offering actionable early-stage defenses to strengthen
the security of MLOps ecosystem. Given the rapid evolution and adoption of
MLOps, we further highlight key research gaps that require immediate attention.
Our work emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols
from the outset, empowering practitioners to safeguard MLOps ecosystem against
evolving cyber attacks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全应用中的结构化推理和工具辅助计算方面表现不足，需要改进。

Method: 使用“random-crypto”框架生成挑战，结合GRPO方法微调工具增强的Llama-3.1-8B模型，通过迭代编写和执行Python代码来优化模型。

Result: 在未见任务上，Pass@8提升了53%（0.35 -> 0.88），Majority@8达到0.41；在外部数据集上，Pass@8提升了13个百分点。

Conclusion: GRPO方法通过更可靠的工具调用和代码合成显著提升了模型性能，而非仅依赖表面提示优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with the structured reasoning and
tool-assisted computation needed for problem solving in cybersecurity
applications. In this work, we introduce "random-crypto", a cryptographic
Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge generator framework that we use to fine-tune a
tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B with Guided Reinforcement Prompt Optimisation
(GRPO), allowing the agent to iteratively write and execute Python inside an
isolated REPL. GRPO yields a +53% absolute jump in Pass@8 on unseen
"random-crypto" tasks (0.35 -> 0.88) and raises Majority@8 to 0.41. The
fine-tuned agent also generalizes to an external dataset. On a subset of
picoCTF cryptography problems, it improves Pass@8 by +13 pp. Ablations show the
gains stem from more reliable tool invocation and code synthesis, rather than
superficial prompt adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在生成有害内容的风险，现有安全对齐技术（如监督微调、人类反馈强化学习等）在面对对抗攻击时仍显脆弱。

Method: 开发了BitBypass攻击方法，通过比特流伪装而非提示工程或对抗性操作来绕过LLMs的安全对齐。

Result: 在五种先进LLMs（如GPT-4o、Gemini 1.5等）上测试，BitBypass成功绕过安全对齐并生成有害内容，且在隐蔽性和成功率上优于其他攻击方法。

Conclusion: BitBypass展示了高效越狱LLMs的能力，突显了现有安全对齐技术的不足。

Abstract: The inherent risk of generating harmful and unsafe content by Large Language
Models (LLMs), has highlighted the need for their safety alignment. Various
techniques like supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human
feedback, and red-teaming were developed for ensuring the safety alignment of
LLMs. However, the robustness of these aligned LLMs is always challenged by
adversarial attacks that exploit unexplored and underlying vulnerabilities of
the safety alignment. In this paper, we develop a novel black-box jailbreak
attack, called BitBypass, that leverages hyphen-separated bitstream camouflage
for jailbreaking aligned LLMs. This represents a new direction in jailbreaking
by exploiting fundamental information representation of data as continuous
bits, rather than leveraging prompt engineering or adversarial manipulations.
Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude
3.5, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral, in adversarial perspective, revealed the
capabilities of BitBypass in bypassing their safety alignment and tricking them
into generating harmful and unsafe content. Further, we observed that BitBypass
outperforms several state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks in terms of stealthiness
and attack success. Overall, these results highlights the effectiveness and
efficiency of BitBypass in jailbreaking these state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: 实验验证了MISLEADER在保持预测性能的同时有效抵抗模型提取攻击。

Conclusion: MISLEADER为现实场景提供了一种高效且不依赖OOD假设的防御方案。

Abstract: Model extraction attacks aim to replicate the functionality of a black-box
model through query access, threatening the intellectual property (IP) of
machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) providers. Defending against such attacks
is challenging, as it must balance efficiency, robustness, and utility
preservation in the real-world scenario. Despite the recent advances, most
existing defenses presume that attacker queries have out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples, enabling them to detect and disrupt suspicious inputs. However, this
assumption is increasingly unreliable, as modern models are trained on diverse
datasets and attackers often operate under limited query budgets. As a result,
the effectiveness of these defenses is significantly compromised in realistic
deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we propose MISLEADER (enseMbles of
dIStiLled modEls Against moDel ExtRaction), a novel defense strategy that does
not rely on OOD assumptions. MISLEADER formulates model protection as a bilevel
optimization problem that simultaneously preserves predictive fidelity on
benign inputs and reduces extractability by potential clone models. Our
framework combines data augmentation to simulate attacker queries with an
ensemble of heterogeneous distilled models to improve robustness and diversity.
We further provide a tractable approximation algorithm and derive theoretical
error bounds to characterize defense effectiveness. Extensive experiments
across various settings validate the utility-preserving and
extraction-resistant properties of our proposed defense strategy. Our code is

Conclusion: 该模型为隐私敏感的健康应用提供了一种高效、安全的解决方案，结合了边缘智能和区块链的优势。

Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving
systems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services
at the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The
integration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring
transactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a
decentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such
systems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive
data interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of
information storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges,
we propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies
tailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The
system supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease
detection, and robust data processing and aggregation. It also includes a data
transaction handler and mechanisms for ensuring privacy at the EGs. Moreover, a
resource-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is
proposed for the multiclass classification of arrhythmia, enabling accurate and
real-time analysis of constrained EGs. Furthermore, a secure access scheme is
defined to manage both off-chain and on-chain data sharing and storage. To
validate the proposed model, comprehensive security, performance, and cost
analyses are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the
fine-grained access control scheme.

Abstract: IDS aims to protect computer networks from security threats by detecting,
notifying, and taking appropriate action to prevent illegal access and protect
confidential information. As the globe becomes increasingly dependent on
technology and automated processes, ensuring secured systems, applications, and
networks has become one of the most significant problems of this era. The
global web and digital technology have significantly accelerated the evolution
of the modern world, necessitating the use of telecommunications and data
transfer platforms. Researchers are enhancing the effectiveness of IDS by
incorporating popular datasets into machine learning algorithms. IDS, equipped
with machine learning classifiers, enhances security attack detection accuracy
by identifying normal or abnormal network traffic. This paper explores the
methods of capturing and reviewing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and
evaluates the challenges existing datasets face. A deluge of research on
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architecture-based intrusion
detection techniques has been conducted in the past ten years on various
cybersecurity datasets, including KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS-2017,
and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We conducted a literature review and presented an in-depth
analysis of various intrusion detection methods that use SVM, KNN, DT, LR, NB,
RF, XGBOOST, Adaboost, and ANN. We provide an overview of each technique,
explaining the role of the classifiers and algorithms used. A detailed tabular
analysis highlights the datasets used, classifiers employed, attacks detected,
evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn. This article offers a thorough
review for future IDS research.

*Zhun Wang,Tianneng Shi,Jingxuan He,Matthew Cai,Jialin Zhang,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberGym是一个大规模、高质量的网络安全评估框架，用于评估LLM代理在生成漏洞复现PoC测试中的能力。现有基准不足，CyberGym填补了这一空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估LLM代理在网络安全任务中的能力，尤其是在真实场景下的表现。

Method: CyberGym基于1,507个真实漏洞构建，要求LLM代理根据文本描述和源代码生成PoC测试。

Result: 最佳组合（OpenHands和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）的成功率仅为11.9%，且主要在简单案例中。此外，LLM代理生成的PoC还发现了15个零日漏洞。

Conclusion: CyberGym为LLM代理在网络安全领域的评估提供了重要工具，揭示了其当前能力的局限性，但也展示了潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at
handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their
cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in
this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture
real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we
introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation
framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across
188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings,
CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests
for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding
source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it
requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant
code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target
vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best
combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%
reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing
historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can
reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest
versions of the software projects.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出ATAG框架，用于系统评估多智能体系统中基于LLM的安全风险，扩展了MulVAL工具，并创建了LVD数据库。通过案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统攻击图方法难以准确建模LLM漏洞，多智能体系统的复杂性和LLM漏洞的动态性使得安全评估具有挑战性。

Method: ATAG扩展MulVAL工具，加入自定义事实和交互规则，以建模AI智能体拓扑、漏洞和攻击场景，并创建LVD数据库标准化漏洞文档。

Result: 案例研究表明ATAG能有效建模多步攻击场景，如提示注入、敏感信息泄露等漏洞。

Conclusion: ATAG为多智能体AI系统提供了一种理解、可视化和优先处理复杂攻击路径的方法，有助于主动识别和缓解威胁。

Abstract: Evaluating the security of multi-agent systems (MASs) powered by large
language models (LLMs) is challenging, primarily because of the systems'
complex internal dynamics and the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities.
Traditional attack graph (AG) methods often lack the specific capabilities to
model attacks on LLMs. This paper introduces AI-agent application Threat
assessment with Attack Graphs (ATAG), a novel framework designed to
systematically analyze the security risks associated with AI-agent
applications. ATAG extends the MulVAL logic-based AG generation tool with
custom facts and interaction rules to accurately represent AI-agent topologies,
vulnerabilities, and attack scenarios. As part of this research, we also
created the LLM vulnerability database (LVD) to initiate the process of
standardizing LLM vulnerabilities documentation. To demonstrate ATAG's
efficacy, we applied it to two multi-agent applications. Our case studies
demonstrated the framework's ability to model and generate AGs for
sophisticated, multi-step attack scenarios exploiting vulnerabilities such as
prompt injection, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and
insecure output handling across interconnected agents. ATAG is an important
step toward a robust methodology and toolset to help understand, visualize, and
prioritize complex attack paths in multi-agent AI systems (MAASs). It
facilitates proactive identification and mitigation of AI-agent threats in
multi-agent applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TransAct V2是Pinterest的Homefeed排序系统模型，通过长用户序列、Next Action Loss函数和低延迟部署提升CTR预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业推荐系统通常依赖短用户序列，缺乏长期行为捕捉和动作预测任务，且难以高效部署大规模序列模型。

Method: TransAct V2利用长用户序列、集成Next Action Loss函数，并采用低延迟部署方案。

Result: 模型提升了CTR预测能力，并优化了用户动作预测和部署效率。

Conclusion: TransAct V2通过创新设计解决了工业推荐系统中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Modeling user action sequences has become a popular focus in industrial
recommendation system research, particularly for Click-Through Rate (CTR)
prediction tasks. However, industry-scale CTR models often rely on short user
sequences, limiting their ability to capture long-term behavior. Additionally,
these models typically lack an integrated action-prediction task within a
point-wise ranking framework, reducing their predictive power. They also rarely
address the infrastructure challenges involved in efficiently serving
large-scale sequential models. In this paper, we introduce TransAct V2, a
production model for Pinterest's Homefeed ranking system, featuring three key
innovations: (1) leveraging very long user sequences to improve CTR
predictions, (2) integrating a Next Action Loss function for enhanced user
action forecasting, and (3) employing scalable, low-latency deployment
solutions tailored to handle the computational demands of extended user action
sequences.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个动态可扩展框架，利用LLM和HDBSCAN技术解决生物医学数据中CDE的语义异构性和结构变异性问题，实现了90.46%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学数据中CDE的语义异构性、结构变异性和上下文依赖性，以提升数据集成和互操作性。

Method: 1. 使用LLM生成上下文感知的文本嵌入；2. 通过HDBSCAN聚类嵌入；3. 自动标注；4. 监督学习训练分类器。

Result: 在24,000多个CDE上识别出118个有意义的聚类，分类器准确率达90.46%。外部验证显示强一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为CDE协调提供了实用解决方案，提高了选择效率并支持数据互操作性。

Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate
harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical
datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural
variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance
interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that
convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns.
These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar
CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding
to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of
embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4)
supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to
labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000
CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum
cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy,
performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity
Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement
(Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that
embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and
scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving
selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RecPO是一个基于偏好优化的框架，通过模拟人类决策的上下文感知和动态机制，提升序列推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的推荐系统缺乏对人类灵活、上下文感知决策策略的模拟，RecPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: RecPO利用自适应奖励边际，结合偏好层次和时间信号，区分偏好和厌恶程度，优先推荐相关项目。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验表明，RecPO性能优于现有基线，并模拟了人类决策的关键特征。

Conclusion: RecPO不仅提升了推荐性能，还更好地模拟了人类决策的动态和上下文感知特性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aspire to profile users by interpreting
their interaction histories, echoing how humans make decisions by weighing
experience, relative preference strength, and situational relevance. Yet,
existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of
mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit,
neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to
human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference
optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to
emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation RecPO exploits
adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal
signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to
distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive
experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only
yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key
characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction,
maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting
contexts.

### [330] [DeepShop: A Benchmark for Deep Research Shopping Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02839)
*Yougang Lyu,Xiaoyu Zhang,Lingyong Yan,Maarten de Rijke,Zhaochun Ren,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DeepShop是一个评估在线购物网络代理的基准，旨在解决现有基准过于简单的问题，通过多样化和复杂化的查询设计，以及细粒度和整体评估框架，提升代理在真实购物场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准未能反映真实购物场景的复杂性，如多维产品属性、搜索过滤器和用户排序偏好，因此需要更贴近实际的评估工具。

Method: DeepShop通过三个关键组件实现：查询多样性演化、查询复杂性演化（分为易、中、难三级）以及细粒度和整体评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，RAG方法因缺乏网络交互能力在复杂查询中表现不佳，而其他方法在过滤器和排序偏好方面面临挑战，整体成功率较低。

Conclusion: DeepShop为深度研究购物代理提供了有效的评估工具，支持其在复杂场景中的进一步发展。

Abstract: Web agents for online shopping have shown great promise in automating user
interactions across e-commerce platforms. Benchmarks for assessing such agents
do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often
consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as "Find iPhone
15." Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving
multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting
preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed
to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments.
DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution:
Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five
popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further
evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes,
search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels:
easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and
holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses
agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search
filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through
holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show
that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction,
while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting
preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform
cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the
advancement of deep research shopping agents.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文指出当前生存分析模型的评估方法存在不足，尤其是过度依赖C指数，提出了更全面的评估标准和方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存分析模型评估方法（如C指数）仅关注判别能力，忽略了预测准确性和校准性等关键方面，导致评估不全面。

Method: 通过文献调研和分析，提出了一套针对生存分析特点的评估指标选择标准，并讨论了其优缺点。

Result: 发现当前评估方法存在局限性，提出了更全面的评估框架，强调了模型和评估指标的假设一致性。

Conclusion: 建议在实践中采用更全面的评估方法，同时总结了反对意见，强调了评估标准的重要性。

Abstract: We argue that many survival analysis and time-to-event models are incorrectly
evaluated. First, we survey many examples of evaluation approaches in the
literature and find that most rely on concordance (C-index). However, the
C-index only measures a model's discriminative ability and does not assess
other important aspects, such as the accuracy of the time-to-event predictions
or the calibration of the model's probabilistic estimates. Next, we present a
set of key desiderata for choosing the right evaluation metric and discuss
their pros and cons. These are tailored to the challenges in survival analysis,
such as sensitivity to miscalibration and various censoring assumptions. We
hypothesize that the current development of survival metrics conforms to a
double-helix ladder, and that model validity and metric validity must stand on
the same rung of the assumption ladder. Finally, we discuss the appropriate
methods for evaluating a survival model in practice and summarize various
viewpoints opposing our analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合强化学习（RL）和漂移扩散模型（DDM）的新框架，用于分析奖励决策和反应时间，并通过隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）捕捉策略切换。该方法在EMBARC研究中显示，抑郁症患者的决策行为与健康对照组存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症（MDD）与奖励处理和注意力问题相关，现有方法未能全面捕捉决策行为的动态变化。本文旨在通过整合RL和DDM模型，更准确地分析决策行为。

Method: 提出RL-DDM框架，结合HMM建模策略切换（“engaged”和“lapsed”状态）。使用广义期望最大化算法高效实现。

Result: 方法在数值研究中优于其他方法，应用于EMBARC研究显示MDD患者决策时间更长、参与度更低，且脑成像数据与“engaged”状态相关。

Conclusion: 新框架有效捕捉决策动态，揭示了MDD患者的独特行为模式，为脑行为关联提供了新证据。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability and mortality,
is associated with reward-processing abnormalities and concentration issues.
Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and
Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we
propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model
and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making
with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that
decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model
latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged''
state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing,
decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed''
state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific
parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The
proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized
expectation-maximization algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through
extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms competing approaches under various reward-generating distributions,
both with and without strategy switching. When applied to the EMBARC study, our
framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than
healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage.
Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are
associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but
not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavioral association
specific to the ''engaged'' state.

Motivation: 多臂老虎机实验设计优于标准随机试验，但现有推断方法要么依赖渐近正态性，要么在实践中功效较弱。

Method: 提出了一种基于模拟的方法，使用正偏的辅助变量生成实验的额外轨迹，以表征非正态样本均值统计量的分布。

Result: 方法在多种常见老虎机设计中实现了渐近类型I错误控制、置信区间收敛和估计量的渐近强一致性，且置信区间宽度减少高达50%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了推断效果，尤其对未被设计针对的臂效果显著。

Abstract: Multi-arm bandit experimental designs are increasingly being adopted over
standard randomized trials due to their potential to improve outcomes for study
participants, enable faster identification of the best-performing options,
and/or enhance the precision of estimating key parameters. Current approaches
for inference after adaptive sampling either rely on asymptotic normality under
restricted experiment designs or underpowered martingale concentration
inequalities that lead to weak power in practice. To bypass these limitations,
we propose a simulation-based approach for conducting hypothesis tests and
constructing confidence intervals for arm specific means and their differences.
Our simulation-based approach uses positively biased nuisances to generate
additional trajectories of the experiment, which we call \textit{simulation
with optimism}. Using these simulations, we characterize the distribution
potentially non-normal sample mean test statistic to conduct inference. We
provide guarantees for (i) asymptotic type I error control, (ii) convergence of
our confidence intervals, and (iii) asymptotic strong consistency of our
estimator over a wide variety of common bandit designs. Our empirical results
show that our approach achieves the desired coverage while reducing confidence
interval widths by up to 50%, with drastic improvements for arms not targeted
by the design.

Motivation: 探讨加速梯度方法在隐私保护和重尾数据鲁棒性中的应用，以提升统计模型的性能。

Method: 针对Frank-Wolfe方法，采用定制学习率和梯度下界；对投影梯度下降，使用Nesterov动量加速。通过高斯机制和几何中位数均值估计器实现隐私和鲁棒性。

Result: 方法在非随机数据、随机无模型数据和参数模型（如线性回归）中均表现出色，迭代复杂度降低，统计保证增强。

Conclusion: 本文方法在隐私和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，并在某些场景下达到最优收敛速率。

Abstract: We study the advantages of accelerated gradient methods, specifically based
on the Frank-Wolfe method and projected gradient descent, for privacy and
heavy-tailed robustness. Our approaches are as follows: For the Frank-Wolfe
method, our technique is based on a tailored learning rate and a uniform lower
bound on the gradient of the $\ell_2$-norm over the constraint set. For
accelerating projected gradient descent, we use the popular variant based on
Nesterov's momentum, and we optimize our objective over $\mathbb{R}^p$. These
accelerations reduce iteration complexity, translating into stronger
statistical guarantees for empirical and population risk minimization. Our
analysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and
parametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models).
Methodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy
gradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and
advanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric
median-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension
of the covariates. Finally, we compare our rates to existing bounds and
identify scenarios where our methods attain optimal convergence.

Result: 该方法在保持操作简单性的同时，能够高效解决离散和全局优化问题。

Conclusion: 随机密钥遗传算法及其变体（如偏置随机密钥遗传算法）是有效的优化工具，具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete
and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of N random keys,
where a random key is a real number randomly generated in the continuous
interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the
optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The benefit of this
approach is that all genetic operators and transformations can be maintained
within the unitary hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This
enhances the productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The
algorithm starts with a population of P vectors of random keys. At each
iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of
high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite
elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of
random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next
iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are
generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and
DeJong (1991), pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key genetic
algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic
algorithms.

Method: 提出Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline（ETAP），通过转置注意力计算来对齐KV上下文长度与WGMMA操作的M维度，减少冗余计算。

Result: 在64K序列长度（批量16）下，FlashMLA-ETAP比FlashMLA快2.78倍，比FlashAttention-3和FlashInfer分别快5.24倍和4.94倍，且数值稳定性更高（RMSE低15.2倍）。

Conclusion: FlashMLA-ETAP填补了资源受限推理的关键空白，为中等性能GPU提供了可扩展解决方案，并推动了硬件感知优化的广泛应用。

Abstract: Efficient inference of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is challenged by
deploying the DeepSeek-R1 671B model on a single Multi-GPU server. This paper
introduces FlashMLA-ETAP, a novel framework that enhances MLA inference for the
single-instance deployment scenario on NVIDIA H20 GPUs. We propose the
Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline (ETAP), which reconfigures attention
computation through transposition to align the KV context length with the
\(M\)-dimension in WGMMA operations, significantly reducing redundant
computations. FlashMLA-ETAP achieves a 2.78x speedup over FlashMLA at 64K
sequence length (batch size 16), with 5.24x and 4.94x improvements over
FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, respectively, while maintaining numerical
stability with a 15.2x lower RMSE (\(1.25 \times 10^{-5}\)) than
FlashAttention-3. Furthermore, ETAP's design enables seamless integration into
frameworks like FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, supported by a detailed
theoretical analysis. Our work addresses a critical gap in resource-constrained
inference, offering a scalable solution for mid-tier GPUs and paving the way
for broader adoption in hardware-aware optimization. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法因串行执行导致模型间相互等待，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入分支并行化技术，通过并行推测分支和自适应草稿长度优化，平衡并行化和令牌回滚。

Conclusion: SpecBranch通过分支并行化显著提升了LLM推理效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Recently, speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique to
accelerate LLM inference by employing a small draft model to propose draft
tokens in advance, and validating them in parallel with the large target model.
However, the existing SD methods still remain fundamentally constrained by
their serialized execution, which causes the mutual waiting bubbles between the
draft and target models. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from
branch prediction in modern processors and propose a novel framework
\textbf{SpecBranch} to unlock branch parallelism in SD. Specifically, we first
take an in-depth analysis of the potential of branch parallelism in SD, and
recognize that the key challenge lies in the trade-offs between parallelization
and token rollback. Based on the analysis, we strategically introduce parallel
speculative branches to preemptively hedge against likely rejections.
Meanwhile, to enhance parallelism, we jointly orchestrate adaptive draft
lengths with a hybrid combination of the implicit draft model confidence and
explicit reusing of target model features. Extensive experiments across various
models and benchmarks show that SpecBranch achieves over \textbf{1.8}$\times
\sim$ \textbf{4.5}$\times$ speedups against the auto-regressive decoding and
reduces rollback tokens by $\textbf{50}$\% for poorly aligned models, realizing
its applicability for real-world deployments.

TL;DR: eACGM是一个基于eBPF的全栈AI/ML系统监控框架，无需代码修改即可实时收集硬件和软件性能数据，并通过GMM模型识别复杂故障模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI/ML系统中性能监控和故障诊断的挑战，尤其是无需侵入式修改的需求。

Method: 利用eBPF收集GPU、网络等硬件及CUDA、PyTorch等软件的性能数据，结合GMM进行统计建模和聚类分析。

Result: 在多节点分布式训练场景中验证了eACGM的低开销和非侵入性，能有效捕捉性能异常。

Conclusion: eACGM适用于实际生产环境，支持大规模AI/ML系统的性能优化和故障诊断。

Abstract: We present eACGM, a full-stack AI/ML system monitoring framework based on
eBPF. eACGM collects real-time performance data from key hardware components,
including the GPU and network communication layer, as well as from key software
stacks such as CUDA, Python, and PyTorch, all without requiring any code
instrumentation or modifications. Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather
process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for
statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies
complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and
communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks
and abnormal behaviors.
  To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive
empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training
scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a
non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical
performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly
detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its
applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing
strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale
AI/ML systems.

*Prachi Jadhav,Hongwei Jin,Ewa Deelman,Prasanna Balaprakash*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的HPC作业调度方法，通过ReAct框架实现迭代、可解释的决策，并在多目标优化中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HPC调度方法（如FCFS或优化技术）难以适应动态工作负载和异构系统，因此需要一种更灵活、透明的解决方案。

Method: 采用LLM和ReAct框架，结合历史记录跟踪和自然语言反馈，通过约束模块确保可行性。

Result: 在七种真实HPC场景中，LLM调度优于FCFS、SJF和OR-Tools，能平衡多目标并提供透明推理。

Conclusion: LLM调度在多目标优化中潜力显著，但计算效率与推理质量的权衡仍需解决。

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) job scheduling involves balancing
conflicting objectives such as minimizing makespan, reducing wait times,
optimizing resource use, and ensuring fairness. Traditional methods, including
heuristic-based (e.g., First-Come-First-Served) or intensive optimization
techniques, often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and heterogeneous HPC
systems. To address this, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based
scheduler using a ReAct-style framework (Reason + Act), enabling iterative,
interpretable decision-making. The system incorporates a scratchpad memory to
track scheduling history and refine decisions via natural language feedback,
while a constraint enforcement module ensures feasibility and safety. We
evaluate our approach using OpenAI's O4-Mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 across
seven real-world HPC workload scenarios, including heterogeneous mixes, bursty
patterns, and adversarial cases. Comparisons against FCFS, Shortest Job First,
and Google OR-Tools (on 10 to 100 jobs) reveal that LLM-based scheduling
effectively balances multiple objectives while offering transparent reasoning
through natural language traces. The method excels in constraint satisfaction
and adapts to diverse workloads without domain-specific training. However, a
trade-off between reasoning quality and computational overhead challenges
real-time deployment. This work presents the first comprehensive study of
reasoning-capable LLMs for HPC scheduling, demonstrating their potential to
handle multiobjective optimization while highlighting limitations in
computational efficiency. The findings provide insights into leveraging
advanced language models for complex scheduling problems in dynamic HPC
environments.

TL;DR: EvoGit是一个去中心化的多智能体框架，通过自主代码进化驱动协作软件开发。它利用Git版本控制系统实现智能体间的异步协作，无需集中协调或显式通信。实验证明其能自主生成功能性和模块化软件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种去中心化的协作软件开发方法，减少人为干预，同时保持代码的一致性和历史记录。

Method: 部署独立的编码智能体，通过Git的版本谱系图实现异步读写和隐式并发，用户仅提供高层目标和轻量反馈。

Result: EvoGit成功完成了两个实际任务：构建一个现代框架的Web应用和一个自进化语言模型求解器的元系统。

Conclusion: EvoGit展示了去中心化、自动化和持续化软件开发的潜力，为未来协作开发提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative
software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a
population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared
codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared
memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic
graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously
read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure
supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent
interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement
is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review
the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or
prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to
autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two
real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern
frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own
language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our
results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for
decentralized, automated, and continual software development. EvoGit is

*Kamal Giri,Amit Garu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的分布式系统一致性违规故障（CVFs）分析方法，以Dijkstra的Token Ring问题为例，通过计算程序转换排名及其影响量化CVFs对系统行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式系统中一致性违规故障（CVFs）会导致节点操作过时或不准确的数据，影响系统收敛和性能，因此需要量化其影响。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络（FNN）和分布式神经网络（基于TensorFlow的tf.distribute API）训练小型图（3到10个节点）生成的数据集，预测关键参数以确定排名影响。

Result: 实验结果显示测试损失为4.39，平均绝对误差为1.5，性能良好。分布式训练在CPU上未显著提升速度，但表明通过GPU或TPU可增强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化CVFs的影响，未来可通过硬件加速器优化扩展性。

Abstract: Distributed systems frequently encounter consistency violation faults (cvfs),
where nodes operate on outdated or inaccurate data, adversely affecting
convergence and overall system performance. This study presents a machine
learning-based approach for analyzing the impact of CVFs, using Dijkstra's
Token Ring problem as a case study. By computing program transition ranks and
their corresponding effects, the proposed method quantifies the influence of
cvfs on system behavior. To address the state space explosion encountered in
larger graphs, two models are implemented: a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
and a distributed neural network leveraging TensorFlow's \texttt{tf.distribute}
API. These models are trained on datasets generated from smaller graphs (3 to
10 nodes) to predict parameters essential for determining rank effects.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, with a test loss of
4.39 and a mean absolute error of 1.5. Although distributed training on a CPU
did not yield significant speed improvements over a single-device setup, the
findings suggest that scalability could be enhanced through the use of advanced
hardware accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs.

TL;DR: MorphServe是一个动态、工作负载感知的LLM服务框架，通过形态适应技术解决动态和突发工作负载下的服务挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有服务框架和静态模型压缩技术无法适应工作负载波动，导致服务目标（SLO）违规或精度下降。

Method: MorphServe引入两种异步、令牌级运行时机制：量化层交换和压力感知KV缓存调整。

Result: 实验表明，MorphServe将平均SLO违规减少92.45%，P95 TTFT延迟提升2.2x-3.9x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: MorphServe是动态环境中LLM部署的实用弹性解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty
workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving
frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload
fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under
full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static
quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving
framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two
asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which
selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during
high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically
adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms
enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully
compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive
experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads
demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and
improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving,
without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as
a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模原子模拟对计算材料和化学的实际应用至关重要，但并行化MLIPs在多设备上仍具挑战性。

Method: DistMLIP通过图分区而非传统的空间分区实现并行化，支持灵活的多层图神经网络架构。

Result: 在8个GPU上，DistMLIP实现了近百万原子计算的秒级完成。

Conclusion: DistMLIP为现有MLIPs提供了易用、灵活的分布式推理解决方案，显著提升了计算规模与效率。

Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational
materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications.
In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical
calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple
devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending
simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present
DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on
zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional
space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP
parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on
flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks.
DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables
distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four
widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We
show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom
calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes集群在动态云环境中面临状态一致性问题，导致操作中断和经济损失，需要更可靠的RCA方法。

Method: SynergyRCA结合LLMs、图数据库检索和专家提示，构建StateGraph和MetaGraph以捕获时空关系和实体连接。

Result: 在真实Kubernetes集群数据集上测试，SynergyRCA平均2分钟识别根因，精确度约0.90。

Conclusion: SynergyRCA展示了LLMs在复杂系统RCA中的潜力，显著提升了Kubernetes的可靠性。

Abstract: Kubernetes, a notably complex and distributed system, utilizes an array of
controllers to uphold cluster management logic through state reconciliation.
Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due
to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues,
especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in
operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for
robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The
development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for
RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the
diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of
incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we
introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval
augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts.
SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal
relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the
occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and
SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific
insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production
Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root
causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA
demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about
two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存对LLM服务的吞吐量和延迟有显著影响，但现有研究多基于合成工作负载，缺乏对实际工作负载的系统性分析。

Method: 通过分析领先LLM服务提供商的KV缓存工作负载模式，总结了未在先前研究中发现的观察结果，并提出了基于工作负载的缓存淘汰策略。

Result: 发现KV缓存的重用模式具有多样性和可预测性，且理想缓存命中率所需的缓存大小适中；提出的策略在真实工作负载下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 实际工作负载的KV缓存模式具有独特特征，基于此的缓存淘汰策略能有效优化LLM服务性能。

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and
caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially
improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited
understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system
design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In
this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$
workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw
observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic
workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses
between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the
reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a
specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall
cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the
characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy
that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with
limited cache capacity.

Motivation: 无线个性化联邦学习（WPFL）中隐私问题和性能公平性挑战尚未得到充分研究，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用量化误差增强隐私，提出量化辅助高斯差分隐私机制，并通过优化传输调度策略实现最小-最大公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、最大测试损失和公平性上分别优于其他策略87.08%、16.21%和38.37%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了WPFL中的隐私和公平性问题，并通过实验验证了其性能优势。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) offers a solution to balancing
personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to
guide personalized learning (PL). Little attention has been given to wireless
PFL (WPFL), where privacy concerns arise. Performance fairness of PL models is
another challenge resulting from communication bottlenecks in WPFL. This paper
exploits quantization errors to enhance the privacy of WPFL and proposes a
novel quantization-assisted Gaussian differential privacy (DP) mechanism. We
analyze the convergence upper bounds of individual PL models by considering the
impact of the mechanism (i.e., quantization errors and Gaussian DP noises) and
imperfect communication channels on the FL of WPFL. By minimizing the maximum
of the bounds, we design an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that
yields min-max fairness for WPFL with OFDMA interfaces. This is achieved by
revealing the nested structure of this problem to decouple it into subproblems
solved sequentially for the client selection, channel allocation, and power
control, and for the learning rates and PL-FL weighting coefficients.
Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that our approach
substantially outperforms alternative scheduling strategies by 87.08%, 16.21%,
and 38.37% in accuracy, the maximum test loss of participating clients, and
fairness (Jain's index), respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了异构节点上的训练性能，并增强了在复杂动态场景中的适应性。

Abstract: Hybrid parallelism techniques are essential for efficiently training large
language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, current automatic parallel planning
frameworks often overlook the simultaneous consideration of node heterogeneity
and dynamic network topology changes, limiting their effectiveness in practical
applications. In this paper, we address these limitations by modeling
heterogeneous nodes within dynamically changing network environments and
leveraging simulation-based strategies to determine optimal parallel
configurations. Our approach enables fine-grained workload allocation tailored
for heterogeneous nodes and complex network scenarios, achieving performance
competitive with state-of-the-art methods under regular and stable network
conditions. Additionally, we introduce a strategy pruning technique to rapidly
discard infeasible parallel configurations, substantially reducing the search
space and accelerating the search process through parallel execution within the
simulator. Preliminary evaluations confirm that our method notably enhances
training performance on heterogeneous nodes and demonstrates improved
adaptability in complex, dynamic scenarios such as cloud computing
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“随机支配真实性”（SD-truthfulness）的新机制，用于在非线性支付规则下激励真实反馈，并通过改进的舍入方法和新的“强制一致”（EA）机制实现更高的敏感性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统同行预测机制假设代理的效用是分数的线性函数，但实际中非线性支付规则更常见。因此，需要一种更强的方法来激励真实反馈。

Method: 提出SD-truthfulness概念，并通过改进的舍入方法和新的EA机制实现这一目标。

Result: EA机制在二元信号设置下理论上保证SD-truthfulness，并在实验中表现出最高的敏感性。

Conclusion: SD-truthfulness为非线性支付规则下的真实反馈提供了更强保障，EA机制是当前最有效的SD-truthful机制。

Abstract: Eliciting reliable human feedback is essential for many machine learning
tasks, such as learning from noisy labels and aligning AI systems with human
preferences. Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize truthful reporting without
ground truth verification by scoring agents based on correlations with peers.
Traditional mechanisms, which ensure that truth-telling maximizes the expected
scores in equilibrium, can elicit honest information while assuming agents'
utilities are linear functions of their scores. However, in practice,
non-linear payment rules are usually preferred, or agents' utilities are
inherently non-linear.
  We propose stochastically dominant truthfulness (SD-truthfulness) as a
stronger guarantee: the score distribution of truth-telling stochastically
dominates all other strategies, incentivizing truthful reporting for a wide
range of monotone utility functions. Our first observation is that no existing
peer prediction mechanism naturally satisfies this criterion without strong
assumptions. A simple solution -- rounding scores into binary lotteries -- can
enforce SD-truthfulness, but often degrades sensitivity, a key property related
to fairness and statistical efficiency. We demonstrate how a more careful
application of rounding can better preserve sensitivity. Furthermore, we
introduce a new enforced agreement (EA) mechanism that is theoretically
guaranteed to be SD-truthful in binary-signal settings under mild assumptions,
and empirically achieves the highest sensitivity among all known SD-truthful
mechanisms.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了在人类分类背景下设计最优AI代理的复杂性，并提供了在特定情况下高效求解的方法。动态优化代理在实践中表现良好，为AI与人类协作提供了新视角。

Abstract: As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks
to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to
delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the
decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full
awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given
decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating
indistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features --
as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal
algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important
dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that
the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal
standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem
is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,
and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the
properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show
that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However,
we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in
several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be
decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm.
Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an
algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted
by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal
delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新方法，用于预测ALS患者功能显著受损的时间，并通过多事件生存模型验证了其有效性，结果显示协变量模型优于Kaplan-Meier估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于ALS疾病的异质性，确定最佳治疗时机具有挑战性，因此需要一种预测功能衰退时间的方法以优化治疗计划。

Method: 研究将任务建模为多事件生存问题，使用PRO-ACT数据集训练五个协变量生存模型，预测500天内功能衰退的概率，并生成个体生存分布（ISD）。

Result: 协变量模型在预测事件时间上优于Kaplan-Meier估计器，且发现Riluzole对功能衰退影响甚微，而延髓起病ALS患者在言语和吞咽功能上衰退更快。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于临床数据评估功能衰退风险，实现个性化治疗规划。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor
neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment
options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life; however, due to
the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the
optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study,
we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS
experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R<=2) with respect to
five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking and
breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and
validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset by training five covariate-based
survival models to estimate the probability of an event over a 500-day period
after a baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival
distributions (ISDs) for each patient, each providing an interpretable and
meaningful estimate of when that event will likely take place in the future.
The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier
estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, our method
enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions, where
certain features (covariates) can be changed to see their effect on the
predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little to no
impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset
ALS, our method predicts considerably shorter counterfactual time-to-event
estimates for tasks related to speech and swallowing compared to limb-onset
ALS. The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to
assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized
treatment planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨扭转在整数同调中的作用，揭示基于域系数的拓扑数据分析工具可能掩盖扭转特征的问题。

Method: 使用合成和高维数据，评估扭转对扰动的敏感性及其在不同自编码器架构中的可恢复性。

Result: 发现基于域系数的方法存在关键局限性，扭转信息在编码过程中可能丢失或无法重建。

Conclusion: 需要设计能够保留扭转信息的架构或损失函数，以实现更稳健的数据表示。

Abstract: We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that
incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA
tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in
integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in
the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders.
Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity
to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder
architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches
and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional
information for robust data representation.

### [353] [An Exploratory Framework for Future SETI Applications: Detecting Generative Reactivity via Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02730)
*Po-Chieh Yu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种探索性框架，测试噪声输入是否能引发语言模型的结构化响应，并发现鲸鱼和鸟类的叫声比白噪声更能触发模型的结构化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索语言模型是否能从噪声输入中检测潜在结构，而不依赖传统的解码方法。

Method: 方法包括使用四种声学输入（人类语音、鲸鱼叫声、鸟类鸣叫和白噪声）测试GPT-2模型，并定义了一个综合评分SIP来衡量反应性。

Result: 结果显示鲸鱼和鸟类的叫声比白噪声具有更高的SIP分数，表明语言模型能从未经语义编码的数据中检测结构。

Conclusion: 结论是这种方法可以补充传统SETI方法，为未知意图的数据提供新的分析视角。

Abstract: We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can
induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that
extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can
trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from
decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the
input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text,
using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations,
Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All
inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To
assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction
Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and
repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher
SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate
responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even
in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could
complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative
intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify
data worth closer attention.

Method: 通过语音韵律推断意图，并结合大型语言模型进行上下文学习，以消歧和选择任务计划。同时，提出了首个机器人领域的模糊语音数据集。

Result: 方法在检测话语中的指代意图时达到95.79%的准确率，对模糊指令的任务计划选择准确率为71.96%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了人机通信的效果，展示了利用语音韵律解决意图歧义的潜力。

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language
instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional
methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often
discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a
novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve
instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models
via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans.
Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics,
designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves
95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within an utterance and
determines the intended task plan of ambiguous instructions with 71.96%
accuracy, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve human-robot
communication.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的高层对象融合方法HiLO，改进Adapted Kalman Filter，显著提升了F1分数和平均IoU，并在大规模真实数据集上验证了其有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，传感器数据融合对环境的鲁棒感知至关重要。基于学习的融合方法虽然性能高，但复杂度和硬件需求限制了其在量产车中的应用。高层融合方法计算需求较低且鲁棒性强，但传统方法如卡尔曼滤波占主导地位。

Method: 论文改进了Adapted Kalman Filter（AKF），并提出了一种新型的基于Transformer的高层对象融合方法HiLO。

Result: 实验结果显示，F1分数提升了25.9个百分点，平均IoU提升了6.1个百分点。在大规模真实数据集上的评估验证了方法的有效性，跨域评估进一步证明了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: HiLO方法在高层对象融合中表现出色，显著提升了性能，并具备良好的泛化能力。代码、数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the
environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use
feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and
hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles.
High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational
requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this
area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel
transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental
results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$
score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale
real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between
urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at

Motivation: 研究机器代理与艺术创作的边界，探索AI在艺术中的角色及其伦理责任。

Method: 采用三层信仰系统（微观适应战术、中观叙事驱动、宏观首要指令）协调机器人与环境的互动，结合观众参与。

Result: 作品展示了机器人与观众共同创作的艺术生态，重新定义了代理、创作权和伦理。

Conclusion: 通过融合控制论、机器人实验和概念规则，作品为当代艺术中的代理与伦理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Symbiosis of Agents is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen that embeds
AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension
between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics,
rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid
exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the
public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive
tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This
hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues
and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding
drama.Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical
exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in
AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive
lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools,
forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of
Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual
rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in
contemporary art.

Result: 实验结果表明，OIO框架成功建立了嗅觉导航的基线，为未来研究提供了基础，并指出了性能优化的方向。

Conclusion: OIO框架为嗅觉导航研究奠定了基础，未来可通过性能优化应对更复杂的任务。

Abstract: Olfactory navigation is one of the most primitive mechanisms of exploration
used by organisms. Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very
difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory
inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and
fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to
visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO
can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We
demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real
5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real
applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate
success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research
in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that
can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which
aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies.
Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to
synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring
paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a
stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge
formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp
spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To
guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that
encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability.
Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates
stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work
enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges
vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

Result: DRL引导的ALNS在解质量和效率上优于传统方法（如最便宜位置、固定位置、二进制整数规划和静态启发式）。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了学习驱动控制在组合优化中的优势，为仓库系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Pod Repositioning Problem (PRP) in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems
(RMFS) involves selecting optimal storage locations for pods returning from
pick stations. This work presents an improved solution method that integrates
Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL). A DRL agent dynamically selects destroy and repair operators and adjusts
key parameters such as destruction degree and acceptance thresholds during the
search. Specialized heuristics for both operators are designed to reflect
PRP-specific characteristics, including pod usage frequency and movement costs.
Computational results show that this DRL-guided ALNS outperforms traditional
approaches such as cheapest-place, fixed-place, binary integer programming, and
static heuristics. The method demonstrates strong solution quality and
illustrating the benefit of learning-driven control within combinatorial
optimization for warehouse systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机追逃问题提供了高效解决方案，AMSPB算法在对抗性训练中表现出色。

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of small UAVs in civilian and military airspace
has raised critical safety and security concerns, especially when unauthorized
or malicious drones enter restricted zones. In this work, we present a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion.
We train neural network policies to command body rates and collective thrust,
enabling high-speed pursuit and evasive maneuvers that fully exploit the
quadrotor's nonlinear dynamics. To mitigate nonstationarity and catastrophic
forgetting during adversarial co-training, we introduce an Asynchronous
Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm where, at each stage, either the
pursuer or evader learns against a sampled opponent drawn from a growing
population of past and current policies. This continual learning setup ensures
monotonic performance improvement and retention of earlier strategies. Our
results show that (i) rate-based policies achieve significantly higher capture
rates and peak speeds than velocity-level baselines, and (ii) AMSPB yields
stable, monotonic gains against a suite of benchmark opponents.

TL;DR: Tru-POMDP是一种结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和POMDP规划的任务规划方法，用于处理家庭服务机器人中的不确定性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭服务机器人在真实环境中执行任务时面临模糊指令、未知物体位置和开放词汇物体类型等问题，导致不确定性高且规划空间巨大。

Method: Tru-POMDP通过分层假设树（TOH）利用LLM生成高质量粒子信念，并结合POMDP模型进行贝叶斯信念跟踪和高效规划。

Result: 实验表明，Tru-POMDP在复杂物体重排任务中优于现有基于LLM和LLM树搜索的规划器，成功率高、规划更优、鲁棒性更强且效率更高。

Conclusion: Tru-POMDP通过结合LLM和POMDP，有效解决了开放不确定性任务规划问题，为家庭服务机器人提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Task planning under uncertainty is essential for home-service robots
operating in the real world. Tasks involve ambiguous human instructions, hidden
or unknown object locations, and open-vocabulary object types, leading to
significant open-ended uncertainty and a boundlessly large planning space. To
address these challenges, we propose Tru-POMDP, a planner that combines
structured belief generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) with principled
POMDP planning. Tru-POMDP introduces a hierarchical Tree of Hypotheses (TOH),
which systematically queries an LLM to construct high-quality particle beliefs
over possible world states and human goals. We further formulate an open-ended
POMDP model that enables rigorous Bayesian belief tracking and efficient
belief-space planning over these LLM-generated hypotheses. Experiments on
complex object rearrangement tasks across diverse kitchen environments show
that Tru-POMDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and
LLM-tree-search hybrid planners, achieving higher success rates with
significantly better plans, stronger robustness to ambiguity and occlusion, and
greater planning efficiency.

Result: 在移动导航和高维操作任务中，UniConFlow表现出比现有约束生成规划器更高的安全性和可行性。

Conclusion: UniConFlow为机器人轨迹生成提供了一种灵活且约束感知的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have become increasingly powerful tools for robot motion
generation, enabling flexible and multimodal trajectory generation across
various tasks. Yet, most existing approaches remain limited in handling
multiple types of constraints, such as collision avoidance and dynamic
consistency, which are often treated separately or only partially considered.
This paper proposes UniConFlow, a unified flow matching (FM) based framework
for trajectory generation that systematically incorporates both equality and
inequality constraints. UniConFlow introduces a novel prescribed-time zeroing
function to enhance flexibility during the inference process, allowing the
model to adapt to varying task requirements. To ensure constraint satisfaction,
particularly with respect to obstacle avoidance, admissible action range, and
kinodynamic consistency, the guidance inputs to the FM model are derived
through a quadratic programming formulation, which enables constraint-aware
generation without requiring retraining or auxiliary controllers. We conduct
mobile navigation and high-dimensional manipulation tasks, demonstrating
improved safety and feasibility compared to state-of-the-art constrained
generative planners. Project page is available at https://uniconflow.github.io.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习代理在适应性上的不足，借鉴哺乳动物的导航系统，提升机器人的空间智能。

Method: 通过网格细胞编码器将运动数据转换为周期性空间编码，结合视觉和运动传感器数据，使用PPO训练策略。

Result: 在简单场景中达到99%的成功率，复杂场景中超过94%，导航效率更高。

Conclusion: EDEN为机器人空间智能提供了一种生物启发的解决方案，结合了神经导航原理和强化学习。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents are often fragile while humans remain
adaptive and flexible to varying scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present
EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned
entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable
autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system,
EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation
using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder
that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing
low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these
activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in
the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the
high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to
a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic,
goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid
prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise.
Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity)
or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate,
within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded
paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a
replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell
encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and
motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within
biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded
spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with
reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.

Result: 在标准MARL基准测试中（包括SMAC II地图）优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 新算法通过选择性探索和混合策略，显著提升了MARL的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms
typically require significantly more environment interactions than their
single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty
in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to
MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that
combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning,
incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a
selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the
global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual
critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward
high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the
centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$)
algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the
actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL,
mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This
approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely
off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of
SMAC II maps.

Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher
demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios.
Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge.
However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such
as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper
proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving
scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit
recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as
dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and
deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts
based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle,
enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The
dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a
high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's
generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced
techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization
are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting
performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method
not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also
achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the
practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and
models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of
research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a
promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with
significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,
while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets
remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the
presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across
different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal
redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their
effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video
Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the
optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop
reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution
based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach
significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial
improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on
more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in
computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to
oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking
tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of
therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy
and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their
clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a
novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable
deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal
reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense
displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our
method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement
field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient
refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations
when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and
abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from
the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy
to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between
implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method
generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and
matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its
potential for clinical adoption.

Motivation: 现代AI系统在可靠性要求高的环境中表现不佳，如消防场景。每年大量消防员因感知失误受伤，因此需要开发更可靠的AI系统。

Method: Fire360数据集包含228个360度视频，涵盖多种恶劣条件（如低光、热变形），并标注了动作片段、物体位置和退化元数据。支持五项任务，包括视觉问答、时序动作描述等。

Conclusion: 通过发布Fire360及其评估套件，旨在推动AI在不确定性环境下的感知、记忆、推理和行动能力。数据集已公开。

Abstract: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical
- scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year,
tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns
in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating
perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset
includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under
diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action
segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five
tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object
Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval
(TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged
counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant
recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag
significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing
Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see,
but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty. The dataset is available
at: https://uofi.box.com/v/fire360dataset.

Method: 1. 文本锚定的视觉语言对比知识蒸馏（VLCD）；2. 使用自然图像数据集进行无监督预蒸馏。

Result: 方法在性能和鲁棒性上优于教师模型，尤其适用于低质量图像。

Conclusion: VLCD提升了医疗视觉语言对比学习的效率和部署性，适用于资源有限环境。

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting
and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in
AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports
for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However,
existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their
deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive
learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1)
text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new
knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2)
unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved
initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or
surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and
acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in
improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for
lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency
and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare
solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 本文为深度学习视频合成引入物理约束提供了理论框架，连接了数据驱动模型与物理运动模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded
unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However,
current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast
datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion,
resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the
realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency
domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We
first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of
diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each
motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building
on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a
physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of
generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency
domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to
conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network
functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across
multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without
compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain
physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video
generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating
physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This
work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and
physics-based motion models.

Abstract: Image scoring is a crucial task in numerous real-world applications. To trust
a model's judgment, understanding its rationale is essential. This paper
proposes a novel training method for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate
not only image scores but also corresponding justifications in natural

VLM, our method enables self-training, utilizing the VLM's generated text
without relying on external data or models. In addition, we introduce a simple
method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted
scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with
Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we
can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了DNN固有的对抗鲁棒性，挑战了传统观点，同时避免了高计算开销。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely
recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most
commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the
adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining
the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational
overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the
clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive
Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example
detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct
feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths
and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the
recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial
accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method
with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits
a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies.
Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage
with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent
adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of
the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态嵌入任务中表现出色，但硬负样本的具体贡献尚未被深入研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析info-NCE损失的梯度，提出显式梯度放大器方法，增强硬负样本的梯度，从而提升模型学习能力。

Result: 基于LLaVA-OneVision-7B架构的模型在MMEB基准测试中达到最优性能，结合自研MLLM（QQMM）后位居MMEB排行榜首位。

Conclusion: 显式梯度放大器方法有效提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能，为对比学习提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in
recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and
universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite
these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely
unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective
mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing
performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for
hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While
these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific
contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and
negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model
parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the
gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model
to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model,
trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the
LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone.
Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach
attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major
bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research
has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial
relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object
counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial
reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology.
OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial
logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained
subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we
construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both
open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial
understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial
understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential
directions for future research.

Result: Coral在MERIT上性能提升45.9%，并在8个基准测试中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: MERIT数据集和Coral框架为多条件语义检索研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains
underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single
languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to
fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by
maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However,
practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition
queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first
multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval,
comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7
distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing
models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while
neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose
Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by
integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional
elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics.
Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement
over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities
validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our
contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in
existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a
foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic
retrieval.

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are
limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are
urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released
their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and
manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community
interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully
constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features
extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered
essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such
inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named
UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models
and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model
using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on
image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image
understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across
multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including
model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

Motivation: 扩散模型的高计算成本限制了其实际应用，现有神经架构搜索方法因重新训练需求、搜索复杂性和评估耗时等问题效率低下。

Method: Flexiffusion将生成过程分解为灵活的分段，动态组合完整计算、缓存重用和跳过计算三种步骤类型，并引入轻量级评估指标rFID。

Conclusion: Flexiffusion为高效搜索高速扩散模型提供了资源节约的解决方案，无需牺牲生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing
high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to
iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can
optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,
exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation
relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose
Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation
schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our
key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of
equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full
(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped
computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool
exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural
diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation
metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead
of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice,
Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable
Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$,
outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$
speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers
a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing
quality.

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual
Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in
perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the
bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their
abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR,
featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities
across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we
introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for
generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only
generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides
fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over
intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and
model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles
empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal
bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of
contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the
similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for
text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input
caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency
score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison
pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art
alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time
scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore,
performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across
a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation. Our

*Yu,Qian,Wilson S. Geisler,Xue-Xin Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法（DVC）来比较模型与猴子大脑在图像分类任务中的决策策略相似性，发现模型与模型之间的相似性高于模型与猴子之间的相似性，且后者随模型性能提升而降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络与猴子大脑在图像分类任务中的决策策略是否相似，以揭示两者在任务相关表征上的差异。

Method: 提出决策变量相关（DVC）方法，量化分类任务中解码决策的相似性，并应用于猴子V4/IT记录和图像分类模型。

Result: 模型间相似性与猴子间相似性相当，但模型与猴子相似性较低且随模型性能提升而下降；对抗训练和更大数据集预训练未改善模型与猴子相似性。

Conclusion: 猴子V4/IT与图像分类模型在任务相关表征上存在根本性差异。

Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on
image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their
representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we
propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision
strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable
correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on
individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant
information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this
method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification
tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey
similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and,
surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While
adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey
similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases
model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not
improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental
divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those
learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the
Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in
foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction,
action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features
are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then
fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun
co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the
predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a
fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences.
Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing
a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/CorrineQiu/Ego4D-LTA-Challenge-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从预训练扩散模型到流匹配（FM）的高效知识迁移问题，克服当前FM模型计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出Diff2Flow框架，通过时间步重缩放、对齐插值和推导FM兼容速度场，实现扩散模型到FM的直接高效微调。

Result: Diff2Flow在参数高效约束下优于朴素FM和扩散微调，并在多样化下游任务中达到或超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: Diff2Flow为扩散模型与FM的结合提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity
outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical
performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally
prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses
the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained
diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that
systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps,
aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from
diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM
finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our
experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion
finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving
superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted
more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for
real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly
based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the
complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly
accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris,
enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train
and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset
Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data
simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562
frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset.
Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station,
achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability
to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中高效且详细地理解场景的需求，平衡计算成本与准确性。

Method: 使用定制数据集微调视觉语言模型，采用分层问答策略分解任务，动态跳过问题以减少计算，合成答案生成连贯描述。

Result: 在定制数据集上表现优于GPT-4o，显著降低推理时间，实时部署中能高效捕捉关键驾驶元素。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动驾驶场景理解中实现了高效与准确的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for
scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with
detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language
model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the
vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the
inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene
understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of
generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree,
where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle
to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g.,
"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped
based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted
answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent,
contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on
the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its
competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key
scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover,
qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's
capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粒度球（GB）的近似边界采样方法（GBABS），通过限制扩散生成GB（RD-GBG）避免重叠，并结合异质最近邻概念，首次实现边界采样并提升噪声数据集质量。

Motivation: 现有基于GB的采样方法缺乏边界采样策略，且因GB重叠导致类边界模糊或缩小，限制了其在分类任务中的表现。

Method: 1. 提出RD-GBG方法，通过受限扩散生成GB，避免重叠并保持几何精确性；2. 提出GBABS方法，基于异质最近邻概念，实现边界采样并提升噪声数据集质量。

Result: 实验表明，GBABS在噪声数据集上表现优异，无需最优纯度阈值，且优于现有GB采样方法和代表性采样方法。

Conclusion: GBABS是一种高效的边界采样方法，特别适用于噪声数据集，提升了分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data
compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on
granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy
classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence
of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or
shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline
sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a
restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which
prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric
representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of
heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling
(GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable
of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.
Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on
borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets
without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method
and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

Result: 在Breakfast、50 Salads和DARai数据集上表现优异，平均预测准确率提升3.08%，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 多模态和层次化建模在动作预测中具有潜力，为未来研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially
observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action
recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must
handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and
inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made,
traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the
potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration
from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action
Anticipation (m\&m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that
combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical
semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of
inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator
paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize
performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including
Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy
improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the
potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action
anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1-shot和5-shot设置下分别比现有最优方法平均准确率提高了1.92%和1.88%。

Conclusion: 通过加权比较ViT组件解决特征纠缠问题，显著提升了跨域少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a
source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited
annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training
and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement
problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain
patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim
to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural
decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the
entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT
components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where
the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their
equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this
interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by
learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn
disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both
the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms
the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under
1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

Conclusion: 自由观看和视觉搜索可共享共同表示，验证了假设，并展示了高效迁移的潜力。

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific
settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a
common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question
and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention
transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that
free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation,
allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to
task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the
predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS)
metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths.
This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and
31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information
often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot
tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In
this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor,
photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex
scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe
that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration
tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We
identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through
context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of
them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark,
scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled
datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated
representations require features that are jointly informative across clients
while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce
FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning
and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the
core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across
clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention
module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this
adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a
student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,
while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional
counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by
aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple
real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized
baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal
representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights
federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual
representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated
detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the
analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate
algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD,
the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset,
sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test
their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this
dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate
population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved
in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution
between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of
future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with
the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the
challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies,
setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and
clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of
this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a
physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of
predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Abstract: BlackSky introduces Smartflow, a cloud-based framework enabling scalable
spatiotemporal geospatial research built on open-source tools and technologies.
Using STAC-compliant catalogs as a common input, heterogeneous geospatial data
can be processed into standardized datacubes for analysis and model training.

*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Peng Ye,Mingzhu Shen,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-vDiT通过利用vDiT中注意力图的稀疏模式，提出了一种稀疏加速框架，显著降低了计算复杂度和推理延迟，同时保持了视频生成的高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成任务中，扩散变换器（DiTs）的注意力机制具有二次复杂度，导致推理延迟显著。通过分析vDiT中的注意力图，发现其存在可预测的稀疏模式，这为加速提供了机会。

Method: 1) 提出Pattern-optimized稀疏核，针对不同稀疏模式优化计算；2) 设计离线稀疏扩散搜索算法，选择最优稀疏策略；3) 融合共享相同注意力策略的头，提升推理效率。

Result: 在多个vDiT模型中，Sparse-vDiT实现了理论FLOP减少2.09×至2.38×，实际推理速度提升1.58×至1.85×，PSNR值保持高水平（24.13至27.09）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，vDiT中的潜在结构稀疏性可以系统性地用于长视频合成，显著提升效率且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video
generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant
inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video
Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns:
diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\%
attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong
layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the
input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity
acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels
that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for
each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search
algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and
head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal
configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same
attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into
state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1),
Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical
FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$,
and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with
PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent
structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video
synthesis.

*Christian Schlarmann,Francesco Croce,Nicolas Flammarion,Matthias Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuseLIP提出了一种新的多模态嵌入架构，通过单一Transformer模型处理文本和图像标记，实现早期融合，优于传统后期融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比语言-图像预训练方法无法原生处理多模态输入，需额外模块融合特征，限制了性能。

Method: 使用单一Transformer模型，扩展词汇表以包含文本和图像标记，实现早期融合。

Result: FuseLIP在多模态嵌入任务（如VQA和文本引导图像检索）中表现优于其他方法，单模态任务表现与基线相当。

Conclusion: FuseLIP通过早期融合实现了更丰富的多模态表示，为多模态任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image
pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While
this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it
cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a
single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional
modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work,
we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding.
Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a
single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and
image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to
interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared
to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and
evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show
that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as
VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to
baselines on unimodal tasks.

*Zidong Wang,Lei Bai,Xiangyu Yue,Wanli Ouyang,Yiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种原生分辨率图像合成方法，通过Native-resolution diffusion Transformer（NiT）模型，实现了任意分辨率和宽高比的图像生成，突破了传统固定分辨率方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像生成方法受限于固定分辨率和方形图像，无法灵活处理不同分辨率和宽高比的图像。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种能够原生支持可变分辨率的方法。

Method: 提出了Native-resolution diffusion Transformer（NiT）架构，通过建模可变分辨率和宽高比的去噪过程，直接从不同分辨率和宽高比的图像中学习视觉分布。

Result: NiT在ImageNet-256x256和512x512基准测试中均达到最先进性能，并展示了出色的零样本泛化能力，能够生成未见过的超高分辨率（如1536x1536）和多样宽高比（如16:9、3:1）的高保真图像。

Conclusion: 原生分辨率建模在视觉生成模型与先进大语言模型方法之间架起了桥梁，展现了巨大的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling
paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and
aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional
fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length
visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we
introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture
designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its
denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns
intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of
resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512
benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in
advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates
excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates
high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536)
and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These
findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a
bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

TL;DR: EgoVLM是一个专为第一人称视频设计的视觉语言模型，通过强化学习优化，显著提升了在egocentric视频问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴的嵌入式AI应用（如穿戴式摄像头和自主代理）需要从第一人称视频流中进行鲁棒推理。

Method: EgoVLM通过Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）进行微调，直接使用强化学习对齐人类推理步骤，无需监督微调。

Result: EgoVLM-3B在EgoSchema基准测试中表现优于通用VLMs，准确率分别高出14.33和13.87个百分点。

Conclusion: EgoVLM通过显式生成推理轨迹提高了可解释性，适用于下游应用，并提出了一种新颖的关键帧奖励机制，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous
agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video
streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to
integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric
video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with
human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly
tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought
(CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering
benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves
performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on
non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by
14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By
explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability,
making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide
reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising
avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumiCraft是一个端到端的扩散框架，通过整合光照、外观和几何线索，生成高质量且时间一致的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在控制场景光照和视觉外观时缺乏几何线索的显式集成。

Method: IllumiCraft接受HDR视频图、合成重照明帧和3D点轨迹作为输入，在统一扩散架构中整合这些线索。

Result: 生成的视频与用户定义提示对齐，支持背景和文本条件视频重照明，保真度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IllumiCraft通过显式集成几何线索，提升了可控视频生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution
video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of
geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across
frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end
diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1)
high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2)
synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally
paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues;
and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By
integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified
diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos
aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and
text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing
controllable video generation methods. Project Page:

TL;DR: SVGenius是一个全面的SVG处理基准测试，包含2,377个查询，覆盖理解、编辑和生成三个维度，评估了22个主流模型，发现专有模型优于开源模型，但所有模型在复杂性增加时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVG处理基准测试覆盖范围有限、复杂性分层不足且评估范式碎片化，SVGenius旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SVGenius基于24个应用领域的真实数据，通过8个任务类别和18个指标评估模型，涵盖不同规模、架构和训练范式的22个模型。

Result: 专有模型表现优于开源模型，但所有模型在复杂性增加时性能下降；推理增强训练比单纯扩展更有效，但风格迁移仍是最具挑战性的能力。

Conclusion: SVGenius为SVG处理提供了首个系统性评估框架，为开发更强大的矢量图形模型和自动化图形设计应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising
capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited
real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented
evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding,
editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains
with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8
task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning
different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels.
Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform
open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation
with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current
approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than
pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains
the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes
the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial
insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing
automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何在移动边缘计算（MEC）系统中使用深度强化学习（DRL）算法，提出了一种基于Twin Delayed DDPG的新方法，以解决传统DDPG算法的固有弱点，并展示了其优于传统方法的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 移动边缘计算（MEC）需要有效的计算卸载策略，但现有方法如DDPG存在固有弱点，无法完全满足需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于Twin Delayed DDPG算法的新方法，用于独立学习每个用户的计算卸载策略。

Result: 数值结果表明，用户可以通过该方法自主学习有效策略，且性能优于传统DDPG方法。

Conclusion: 新方法克服了传统DDPG的弱点，适用于移动用户场景，性能更优。

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows appliances to offload workloads to
neighboring MEC servers that have the potential for computation-intensive tasks
with limited computational capabilities. This paper studied how deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are used in an MEC system to find
feasible decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategies, which leads
to the construction of an extensible MEC system that operates effectively with
finite feedback. Even though the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm, subject to their knowledge of the MEC system, can be used to
allocate powers of both computation offloading and local execution, to learn a
computation offloading policy for each user independently, we realized that
this solution still has some inherent weaknesses. Hence, we introduced a new
approach for this problem based on the Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm, which
enables us to overcome this proneness and investigate cases where mobile users
are portable. Numerical results showed that individual users can autonomously
learn adequate policies through the proposed approach. Besides, the performance
of the suggested solution exceeded the conventional DDPG-based power control
strategy.

Method: 通过众包研究，204名日本参与者评估了三种ChatGPT声音（Juniper、Breeze和Ember）及七种自我指称。

Result: 发现声音显著影响性别感知，而某些自我指称能通过中性或模糊性避免性别化；年龄和正式性感知与性别化交叉。

Conclusion: 研究强调了代理身份感知的复杂性，提倡在语音代理研究中采用交叉性和文化敏感的视角。

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the
ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics
have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents.
Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit
complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of
other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially
expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese
participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and
Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering
alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering,
i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age
and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories,
especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent
identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work
on voice agents.

Motivation: 随着AI技术在交互系统中的广泛应用，系统的黑箱问题日益突出。尽管XAI技术可以提升单个AI模型的可解释性，但整体系统架构仍不透明。

Method: 提出了一种将交互系统表示为结构化构建块序列的方法，并通过可视化构建块（如XAI技术）进行解释。系统流程和API形成明确的概览。

Result: 该方法为人类和自动化代理（如LLMs）提供了沟通基础，统一了AI模型的人类和机器可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过具体架构和原型系统验证了流程化方法的可行性，为交互系统的透明性提供了新思路。

Abstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems
enables them to solve an equally increasing number of tasks, the black box
problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a
whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by
employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models.
While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system
architecture remains opaque. To this end, we propose an approach to represent
interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks, such as AI
models and control mechanisms grounded in the literature. These can then be
explained through accompanying visual building blocks, such as XAI techniques.
The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an explicit overview
of the system. This serves as a communication basis for both humans and
automated agents like LLMs, aligning human and machine interpretability of AI
models. We discuss a selection of building blocks and concretize our flow-based
approach in an architecture and accompanying prototype interactive system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力图方法仅捕捉纯音听力阈值，准确性有限，需更精准的个性化语音清晰度预测方法。

Method: 利用支持样本（音频、得分）对，结合深度学习模型SSIPNet，构建个体语音识别能力的高维表征。

Result: 在Clarity Prediction Challenge数据集上，即使支持样本数量较少，SSIPNet仍优于听力图预测方法。

Conclusion: SSIPNet为个性化语音清晰度预测提供了新范式，显著提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Personalized speech intelligibility prediction is challenging. Previous
approaches have mainly relied on audiograms, which are inherently limited in
accuracy as they only capture a listener's hearing threshold for pure tones.
Rather than incorporating additional listener features, we propose a novel
approach that leverages an individual's existing intelligibility data to
predict their performance on new audio. We introduce the Support Sample-Based
Intelligibility Prediction Network (SSIPNet), a deep learning model that
leverages speech foundation models to build a high-dimensional representation
of a listener's speech recognition ability from multiple support (audio, score)
pairs, enabling accurate predictions for unseen audio. Results on the Clarity
Prediction Challenge dataset show that, even with a small number of support
(audio, score) pairs, our method outperforms audiogram-based predictions. Our
work presents a new paradigm for personalized speech intelligibility
prediction.

Motivation: 语音障碍是帕金森病的常见生物标志物，但现有研究未充分探索个体差异对深度声学特征分类效果的影响。

Method: 使用NeuroVoz数据集，比较三种预训练音频嵌入在PD分类任务中的表现。

Result: OpenL3在DDK和LR任务中表现最优，Wav2Vec2.0在DDK任务中显示出性别偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非典型语音模式对分类的挑战，强调了改进特征提取和模型鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Speech impairments are prevalent biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD),
motivating the development of diagnostic techniques using speech data for
clinical applications. Although deep acoustic features have shown promise for
PD classification, their effectiveness often varies due to individual speaker
differences, a factor that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing
literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of three pre-trained
audio embeddings (OpenL3, VGGish and Wav2Vec2.0 models) for PD classification.
Using the NeuroVoz dataset, OpenL3 outperforms others in diadochokinesis (DDK)
and listen and repeat (LR) tasks, capturing critical acoustic features for PD
detection. Only Wav2Vec2.0 shows significant gender bias, achieving more
favorable results for male speakers, in DDK tasks. The misclassified cases
reveal challenges with atypical speech patterns, highlighting the need for
improved feature extraction and model robustness in PD detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GOP依赖强制对齐，易受标注和分割错误影响，而对齐无关方法虽解决了这些问题，但计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 引入替代感知对齐无关GOP，通过限制音素替代（基于音素簇和常见错误）提升效率。

Result: 在My Pronunciation Coach和SpeechOcean762数据集上，受限音素替代（RPS）优于非受限（UPS）和基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了GOP的效率，未来可进一步优化音素簇和错误模型。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic
measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP)
metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and
segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods
address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly
with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we
introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme
substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated
our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My
Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult
speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS
(unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods,
which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for
future research.

Motivation: 尽管印地语是全球第四大语言，拥有6亿使用者，但针对印度语言的发音训练工具仍然匮乏。

Method: 提出Dhvani系统，结合合成语音生成和个性化反馈方法，基于印地语的语音特性分析发音错误。

Result: 系统能够识别发音错误并提供针对性反馈。

Conclusion: Dhvani系统为印地语学习者提供了有效的发音训练工具，填补了印度语言CAPT的空白。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied
for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian
languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to
Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn
them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth
most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first
step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT
system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations,
and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners.
While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its
core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic
orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.

*Xiaoxue Gao,Huayun Zhang,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Prompt-Unseen-Emotion（PUE）方法，通过情感引导的提示学习生成未见过的情感语音，解决了现有TTS系统情感范围有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统仅能模拟有限的情感类别，而人类对话涉及更广泛的情感，需要更自然的情感语音生成方法。

Method: 采用LLM-TTS架构，通过情感相关提示学习，定量捕捉每句话的情感权重，灵活调整情感比例生成混合情感语音。

Result: PUE在零样本设置下成功实现了未见情感的语音合成。

Conclusion: PUE方法为情感语音生成提供了更灵活和自然的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited
set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond
these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse
emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap,
this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate
unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained
utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between
categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model
to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During
inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting
emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model
to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully
facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CapTTS在现实应用中因缺乏标准化数据集和下游任务研究而面临的挑战。

Method: 引入CapSpeech数据集，包含机器和人工标注的音频-字幕对，并使用自回归和非自回归模型进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，CapSpeech支持高保真和高度可理解的语音合成，是当前最大的CapTTS相关任务数据集。

Conclusion: CapSpeech为CapTTS系统开发提供了宝贵的数据支持和研究见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly
transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS).
However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to
the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on
downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce
CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks,
including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events
(CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS
(EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech
comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36
million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new
datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced
audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside
the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive
and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate
high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range
of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest
available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks.
The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the
challenges of developing CapTTS systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种滑动窗口扩散框架用于语音增强，解决了传统扩散模型在实时流数据处理中的计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在语音增强中表现出色，但推理时计算成本高，无法满足实时流数据处理的需求。

Method: 采用滑动窗口扩散框架，随时间逐步对语音信号加噪，并对当前帧附近分配更多噪声，通过缓冲区大小权衡性能与延迟。

Result: 该方法在GPU上高效运行，输入输出延迟为0.3至1秒，性能优于标准扩散模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个适用于在线语音增强的实用扩散模型解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently
used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally
expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for
processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window
diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively
corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to
the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay
proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between
performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving
an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first
practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种数据驱动建模方法，用于直接从频域数据构建具有二阶微分结构的动态系统，并基于二阶结构化重心形式扩展了自适应Antoulas-Anderson算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态系统的数据驱动建模中，物理现象的微分结构常被忽略，导致模型难以物理意义化。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于二阶结构化重心形式，扩展自适应Antoulas-Anderson算法，提出两种变体以平衡计算速度和建模精度。

Result: 通过三个数值例子验证了新方法在建模精度和性能上的有效性，优于传统非结构化方法。

Conclusion: 新方法成功保留了动态系统的二阶微分结构，为数据驱动建模提供了更物理意义化的解决方案。

Abstract: The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool
for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In
this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered
physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the
learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work,
we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of
dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from
frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form,
we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of
second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we
propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher
computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical
analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods.
Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured
approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空间嵌入方法过于依赖空间邻近性，而忽视了细粒度的上下文信息，限制了城市建模的效果。

Method: 提出CaLLiPer+模型，结合POI名称和类别标签，采用多模态对比学习框架。

Result: 在土地利用分类和社会经济分布映射任务中，性能提升4%至11%，同时增强了位置检索能力。

Conclusion: 整合细粒度语义属性和多模态学习技术有助于推动城市基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Spatial representations that capture both structural and semantic
characteristics of urban environments are essential for urban modeling.
Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while
underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this
limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that
systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical
labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its
effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and
socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance
gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that
incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture
complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal
the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained
text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the
potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal
learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models.

TL;DR: 该研究对terraPulse公司提供的AGBD数据集进行了独立验证，使用美国森林服务局的FIA数据作为参考，结果显示两者在区域尺度上具有高度一致性，但也指出了非森林区域和高生物量森林中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率监测地上生物量（AGB）及其密度（AGBD）对碳核算和生态系统管理至关重要，但现有商业遥感产品缺乏严格的独立验证。

Method: 研究使用FIA数据对terraPulse的AGBD数据集进行验证，通过六边形和县级尺度的统计分析评估一致性。

Result: 在六边形尺度上，R2=0.88，RMSE=26.68 Mg/ha，r=0.94；县级尺度上一致性更高（R2=0.90，RMSE=32.62 Mg/ha，r=0.95）。非森林区域和高生物量森林中存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究为全球生物量监测提供了可扩展的验证框架，并展示了terraPulse数据集的潜力及其局限性。

Abstract: Monitoring aboveground biomass (AGB) and its density (AGBD) at high
resolution is essential for carbon accounting and ecosystem management. While
NASA's spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR mission
provides globally distributed reference measurements for AGBD estimation, the
majority of commercial remote sensing products based on GEDI remain without
rigorous or independent validation. Here, we present an independent regional
validation of an AGBD dataset offered by terraPulse, Inc., based on independent
reference data from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
program. Aggregated to 64,000-hectare hexagons and US counties across the US
states of Utah, Nevada, and Washington, we found very strong agreement between
terraPulse and FIA estimates. At the hexagon scale, we report R2 = 0.88, RMSE =
26.68 Mg/ha, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.94. At the county scale,
agreement improves to R2 = 0.90, RMSE =32.62 Mg/ha, slope = 1.07, and r = 0.95.
Spatial and statistical analyses indicated that terraPulse AGBD values tended
to exceed FIA estimates in non-forest areas, likely due to FIA's limited
sampling of non-forest vegetation. The terraPulse AGBD estimates also exhibited
lower values in high-biomass forests, likely due to saturation effects in its
optical remote-sensing covariates. This study advances operational carbon
monitoring by delivering a scalable framework for comprehensive AGBD validation
using independent FIA data, as well as a benchmark validation of a new
commercial dataset for global biomass monitoring.

TL;DR: StarVC是一种自回归语音转换框架，通过预测文本标记再合成声学特征，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换方法忽视了对语言内容的显式利用，而StarVC通过结合显式文本建模提升性能。

Method: StarVC采用自回归框架，先预测文本标记，再合成声学特征。

Result: 实验表明，StarVC在保留语言内容和说话人特征方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: StarVC通过显式文本建模提升了语音转换的性能。

Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while
preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker
information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of
linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker
identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could
enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate
semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the
integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified
autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing
acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms
conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and
CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found

Method: 集成多算法异常检测与选择性重新实验，构建包含701个测量值的新数据集，验证多种机器学习模型的性能提升。

Result: 方法显著降低了预测误差（RMSE），仅需重新测量约5%的数据即可显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 数据质量提升对聚合物科学中机器学习应用的可靠性至关重要，该方法为材料科学提供了一种可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven
approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant
experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in
empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to
erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently
by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective
re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical
effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset
containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass
transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density
($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance
improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net,
SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method
reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy
with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the
dataset to be re-measured.These findings highlight the importance of data
quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in
polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive
reliability in materials science.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as
multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks.
This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE)
framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest
Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we
demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental
Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing,
both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles
is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group
dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure
influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting
distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity
of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

Motivation: 区块链交易数据的高维、噪声和纠缠特性使传统聚类算法难以处理，而量子增强聚类模型虽性能优越但解释性不足，限制了其在敏感领域的应用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用经典聚类方法和评估指标确定最佳聚类数量；第二阶段引入AI代理生成可解释的聚类结果语义描述。

Result: 实验表明，量子神经网络（QNN）在定量指标上优于随机量子特征（QF），而AI代理揭示了QNN模型的单例聚类现象，支持三聚类配置。

Conclusion: 该工作提升了量子辅助区块链分析的解释性，为未来自主AI驱动的聚类框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data is inherently high dimensional, noisy, and
entangled, posing substantial challenges for traditional clustering algorithms.
While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising
performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their
application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and
blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis
framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with
AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ
classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette
Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the
optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we
integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of
clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster
relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural
Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics,
the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods,
notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The
consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster
configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach. This
work advances the interpretability frontier in quantum assisted blockchain
analytics and lays the groundwork for future autonomous AI orchestrated
clustering frameworks.

Conclusion: 该框架为高等教育评估提供了全面的脆弱性评估方法，区分真实学习与AI生成内容。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for addressing the challenges
posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education assessment
through a machine-versus-machine approach. Large language models like GPT-4,
Claude, and Llama increasingly demonstrate the ability to produce sophisticated
academic content, traditional assessment methods face an existential threat,
with surveys indicating 74-92% of students experimenting with these tools for
academic purposes. Current responses, ranging from detection software to manual
assessment redesign, show significant limitations: detection tools demonstrate
bias against non-native English writers and can be easily circumvented, while
manual frameworks rely heavily on subjective judgment and assume static AI
capabilities. This paper introduces a dual strategy paradigm combining static
analysis and dynamic testing to create a comprehensive theoretical framework
for assessment vulnerability evaluation. The static analysis component
comprises eight theoretically justified elements: specificity and
contextualization, temporal relevance, process visibility requirements,
personalization elements, resource accessibility, multimodal integration,
ethical reasoning requirements, and collaborative elements. Each element
addresses specific limitations in generative AI capabilities, creating barriers
that distinguish authentic human learning from AI-generated simulation. The
dynamic testing component provides a complementary approach through
simulation-based vulnerability assessment, addressing limitations in
pattern-based analysis. The paper presents a theoretical framework for
vulnerability scoring, including the conceptual basis for quantitative
assessment, weighting frameworks, and threshold determination theory.

challenges, ethical considerations, and future workforce development. This
study analyzes responses from 130 participants to a survey on the capabilities,
impact, and governance of AI agents. We explore expected timelines for AI

beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings
reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors
associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression
model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that
deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully

propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain
graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation
Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive
learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training.
BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying
parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing
the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain
representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we
integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design,
enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological
and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ
meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization
to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning
conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27
neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric
disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical)
across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000
fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases
and parcellations. The code is available at:

Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly
non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been
modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more
recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models.
Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory
processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for
training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken
advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory
midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this
model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore
it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space
of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory
midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised
by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the
explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68%
for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the
art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to
simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the
learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving
crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more
animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen
animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss
compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing
impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the
loop optimisation.
